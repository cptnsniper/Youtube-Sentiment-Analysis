Xtxscxi83XA,3128640,126248,2200,Life is Short (How to Spend It Wisely),20241214,"life is short but most people spend it 
like they have infinite time here's the   reality the average person lives just 30,000 
days that's it think about this if you're 30   years old you've already used up 11,000 of 
those days gone never coming back I should   do it someday but someday is a dangerous word 
it tricks you into thinking you have all the   time in the world in the next 15 minutes you'll 
learn powerful strategies to make your time count   not just managing it but truly living it these 
aren't generic tips about time management these   are deep insights about how life actually works 
chapter one time perception and psychology time   plays tricks on your mind and understanding 
these tricks is your first step to mastering   it remember when you were a kid summer felt 
endless a single day could feel like a week   but now years fly by like months this is the time 
unit Paradox and it's not just in your head it's   how your brain actually works here's the 
science your brain measures Time by recording   new experiences as a kid everything was new your 
brain was constantly recording making time feel   slower but as an adult your routines make days 
blur together same breakfast same commute same   Netflix shows your brain literally skips recording 
these moments just another normal day stuck in his   comfort zone this is the Trap Of Time blindness 
but you can hack this system take different   routes to work learn a new skill every 
month have conversations with strangers   each new experience forces your brain to pay 
attention making time expand again and here's   the biggest time perception mistake we constantly 
overestimate what we can do in a day but massively   underestimate what we can do in a year this is 
why people quit goals too soon chapter 2 priority   management most people confuse being busy with 
being productive they fill their days with tasks   that feel important but but don't actually 
matter here's a powerful tool the deathbed   test think about yourself at 90 years old looking 
back will you care about that extra hour at the   office or that time you spent with your family 
suddenly priorities become Crystal Clear I'll   finish this report first meanwhile Life's real 
priorities slip away one day at a time here's what   successful people understand knowing what not to 
do is more valuable than knowing what to do it's   the two- list strategy write down everything you 
want to achieve now Circle the top three items   everything else that's your avoid list think about 
compound interest but for Life Choices small daily   investments in the right priorities multiply over 
time but there's a catch social media busy work   and constant distractions steal your attention 
from what truly matters the solution ruthlessly   eliminate the non-essential your time time is too 
precious for anything else chapter 3 relationship   Dynamics relationships work like bank accounts 
every small interaction is either a deposit or   withdrawal a genuine compliment deposit being 
late constantly withdrawal and just like real   Banks you can't make withdrawals if you haven't 
made deposits I don't understand why they're upset   I only reach out when I need something and 
there's the problem most people focus on big   gestures expensive gifts Grand celebrations but 
here's the truth small daily deposits matter more   a random text checking in Remembering small 
details being there during tough times here's   something counterintuitive shared suffering 
builds stronger bonds than shared pleasure   going through challenges together creates deeper 
connections than just having fun and don't ignore   your weak ties those casual acquaintances and 
dist and friends they are your Bridges to New   Opportunities ideas and perspectives strong 
ties comfort you but weak ties help you grow   want to expand your sense of time help others 
it's the ultimate Paradox giving time makes you   feel like you have more of it chapter four career 
and purpose your best career opportunities aren't   where you think they are they're one step outside 
your comfort zone this is the adjacent possible   The Sweet Spot between what you know and what you 
could know I need to stay in my Lane but that's   exactly how careers get stuck here's a massive 
career mistake optimizing for money too early   in your 20s and early 30s optimize for learning 
every new skill you gain is like a lottery ticket   for future opportunities Money Follows knowledge 
always forget the career ladder it's a trap modern   careers are more like jungle gyms move sideways 
diagonally even backwards some times each move   builds a unique skill combination that makes you 
Irreplaceable this job is comfortable but Comfort   is career quick sand the longer you stay in a 
role you've outgrown the harder it is to leave   here's the secret use productive procrastination 
when you're avoiding one task channel that energy   into learning something new your procrastination 
projects often reveal your true passion chapter   5 health and vitality Health isn't just about 
living longer it's your life Force multiplier   every other aspect of your life either improves 
or suffers based on your health period think about   this would you rather have eight energized hours 
or 12 draining ones your energy levels matter more   than your time I'll sleep when I'm dead wrong 
mindset sleep isn't just rest it's your brain's   superpower without it your decision making is as 
bad as being drunk that promotion you want that   relationship you're building they all depend 
on your brain work working at its best here's   something nobody talks about you're two different 
people morning you and evening you morning you   makes plans evening you has to follow through 
don't let morning you be a tyrant want a life hack   micro workouts 10 push-ups here a quick walk there 
five minutes of stretching these small movements   add up your body was built to move not sit for 8 
hours remember this physical movement creates m   Clarity stuck on a problem move your body the 
solution will come chapter six learning and   growth want to learn anything faster teach it to 
someone else this is the teacher effect explaining   something forces your brain to understand it at 
a deeper level I'm not ready to teach yet but   that's exactly why you should teach your struggles 
make you a better teacher than an expert you still   remember what's confusing here's a secret learning 
hack read biographies why because each one gives   you a lifetime of experiences in a few hours want 
to avoid common mistakes learn from people who   already made them most people try to get good at 
everything smart people stay strategically bad at   some things it's called deliberate amateurism 
it keeps your brain flexible and your ego in   check constraints aren't your enemy they're 
your superpower limited time limited money   limited resources good these constraints force you 
to be creative and here's the most valuable skill   knowing when to quit strategic quitting isn't 
failure it's making space for better opportunities   quit fast on things that don't serve your growth 
chapter 7 emotional intelligence your emotions   have a secret timer the chemicals that create any 
emotion anger fear frustration last exactly 90   seconds in your body after that you're choosing to 
stay in that emotion I can't help how I feel but   here's the truth while you can't control the first 
wave of emotion you absolutely control the second   think of emotional regulation like a superpower 
raw intelligence might get you the job but   emotional regulation gets you the promotion why 
because people trust those who can stay calm in   chaos most people hide their vulnerability smart 
people use it strategically showing the right   amount of vulnerability at the right time builds 
deeper trust than always appearing perfect here's   a costly mistake avoiding difficult conversations 
these conversations are like compound interest in   reverse the longer you wait the more emotional 
debt you accumulate that small issue you're   avoiding it's growing bigger every day and 
gratitude isn't just a feel-good practice   unexpressed gratitude is like having money in a 
bank you can never withdraw from use it or lose it   chapter eight Financial wisdom money isn't 
just about numbers in your bank account it's   about something far more precious your freedom 
of time here's a truth most people miss making   more money often makes you poorer in time as 
your income grows your lifestyle expands bigger   house more maintenance fancy car more worry better 
neighborhood longer commute finally I can afford   everything I want but that's the Trap lifestyle 
inflation is like running on a treadmill moving   fast but going nowhere think about time affluence 
would you rather make $100,000 working 80 hours a   week or $70,000 working 30 your true hourly rate 
includes everything you sacrifice for that money   most people get this backwards they buy objects 
but rent experiences smart people rent objects   and buy experiences why because experiences 
appreciate in value objects usually don't here's   the ultimate Financial skill building margins 
living below your means isn't about restriction   it's about creating space for opportunities that 
space is your ticket to real wealth chapter nine   creative living creativity isn't about waiting 
for inspiration it works more like a faucet   when you first turn it on rusty water comes out 
that's your bad ideas you need those bad ideas   they clear the way for the good ones I'm waiting 
for the perfect idea but that's like waiting for   the water to get clean without turning on the tap 
you have to push through the rust here's something   counterintuitive creativity loves constraints give 
someone unlimited options they freeze give them   limited options they get creative think about 
it Shakespeare wrote in strict meter and rhyme   those limits forced his creativity most people 
try to create and judge at the same time that's   like trying to drive with one foot on the gas 
and one on the break first create judge later   document everything you create your brain is 
like a creativity muscle it needs to see its   progress to grow stronger those early terrible 
attempts they're your proof of improvement and   here's the real secret combin skills nobody else 
combines that unique intersection that's your   creative superpower chapter 10 personal energy 
your energy is your most precious resource time   management is useless without energy management 
you can't do meaningful work if you're running on   empty most people never audit their energy they 
don't realize some activities give energy While   others drain it that morning walk energy boost 
that toxic friendship energy vampire I just need   more willpower but willpower is like a muscle it 
gets tired smart people don't rely on Willpower   they design their environment to make good 
choices automatic think about decision fatigue   every choice you make takes energy what to to wear 
what to eat when to exercise that's why successful   people often wear the same things and eat the 
same breakfast they're saving their energy for   decisions that matter here's a counterintuitive 
energy hack strategic incompetence being   deliberately bad at non-essential tasks means 
Others Stop asking you to do them your energy   stays protected for what you do best remember 
this recovery isn't a waste of time it's how   you multiply your time's value chapter 11 Social 
Capital success isn't just about what you know   it's about who you know but here's the thing real 
Social Capital isn't about collecting business   cards or LinkedIn connections it's about building 
genuine relationships there's a simple formula for   friendship time plus vulnerability plus shared 
experiences you can't shortcut any of these   elements real connections need all three I don't 
have time for networking but that's missing the   point true networking isn't about taking it's 
about connecting the best networkers aren't   collectors they're connectors they introduce 
people who should know each other most people   underinvested friendship maintenance they wait 
for Big Life events to reconnect but strong   relationships are built in the small moments 
that random check-in text that quick coffee   that's where real bonds grow think about Community 
like a garden you can't plant all the seeds at   once and expect them to grow you need constant 
small acts of nurturing every conversation is   water every introduction is fertilizer the truly 
successful they build their Community before they   need it because when you need a community it's too 
late to build one chapter 12 mental models mental   models are your mind's shortcuts to understanding 
reality but here's the catch the map is not the   territory your mental models are always simpler 
than reality and that's both their strength and   their weakness most people see only what's in 
front of them they play checkers while life plays   chess second order thinking is your advantage 
asking not just what happens next but what   happens after what happens next this seems like 
the obvious choice but obvious to whom your mental   map might be missing crucial territory that's why 
multiple perspectives aren't just useful there a   essential here's a powerful truth knowledge isn't 
power understanding is power knowledge is knowing   that a tomato is a fruit understanding is knowing 
not to put it in a fruit salad most people collect   facts smart people collect patterns think about 
inverse thinking instead of asking how can I solve   this problem ask how am I creating this problem 
sometimes the solution is stopping what causes   the problem in in the first place chapter 13 life 
design your life isn't something that happens to   you it's something you actively design think 
of it like a portfolio not just of money but   of experiences relationships skills and dreams 
most people overvalue planning and undervalue   testing life design isn't about making Perfect 
Plans it's about running small experiments to   see what actually works for you I need to figure 
everything out first but that's exactly backward   you can't think your way into the right life 
you have to test your way there here's what most   people miss about change tiny adjustments create 
massive results want to transform your life start   with changing one thing for 5 minutes that small 
win builds momentum for bigger changes think about   your metrics most people measure their lives by 
Society standards money status possessions but   what if you designed your own metrics what if 
success meant time with family or learning new   skills or helping others regular life reviews 
aren't optional they're how you catch problems   while they're still small monthly reviews prevent 
yearly regrets conclusion life isn't about finding   extra hours it's about making your hours count 
every principle we've covered from time perception   to relationship building from energy management to 
life design works together to create a life worth   living remember time will pass whether you use it 
wisely or not your habits become your days your   days become your years your years become your life 
start small pick one idea that resonated with you   test it refine it make it yours the best time 
to start living fully isn't someday it's today",0.089,0.691,0.22,0.9999
AVKOiC4jHeg,1439499,40865,938,13 Minutes To Change Your Life,20240203,what sort of life would you have to have so that you could bear your suffering nobly that's a good question to ask yourself now and so we have people just write for 15 minutes if you could have what you wanted needed what might that look like and there's an instruction there too is do it badly because what the hell do you know and and besides your vision's going to change as you progress through your life and so you're not getting get it done perfectly but that's okay get it down get a rough first draft down right a rough approximation of who you could be if you got your act together not who other people think you should be you know although that might enter into it because you don't want to be completely you can't be who you are properly and ignore the fact that you're embedded in a social Contex text and so you have to take the fact that they're other people into account and and it doesn't mean be who your parents think you should be either even though that's another source of information that you might want to consider it's it's a see a deeper questions like what would actually motivate you and you might think well I could never have that it's like that's not the question that's being addressed here although I would say there's no sense floating off into some kind of impossible juvenile fantasy and we're making an assumption that you're taking the question seriously and that you're going to remain within the bounds of what you regard as sanely reasonable so that's the first part second part was the opposite of that it's like okay now you now you've specified a goal where the goal is in some sense both your character and your life and you specified that rather vaguely you only had 15 minutes to write about it and that's a good thing because now you have something to move toward now I could tell you this technically this is an interesting thing to know people say they want to be happy that's not true by the way if you investigate what people mean when they say they want to be happy they say I just want to be happy it's a very funny phrase he what do you mean just like there isn't anything harder than that so you can't just say just I just that's all you want you just want to be happy all the time that's all it would take it's like good luck with that that's that's not going to happen so you can get rid of the just and then I want to be happy well maybe actually what people really mean when they say that is they don't want to suffer and be miserable so really what they mean is they don't want to experience excess negative emotion and you you can find that out if you care if you carefully question people and carefully analyze the answers you find out they're actually more concerned about avoiding the catastrophic negative than living in a world of hedonistic Delight now you also find that while avoiding the catastrophic tragedy they wouldn't mind having a little bit of hedonistic delight and so some happiness is interleaved in there then you might ask yourself to the degree that people do want hedonistic Delight when they're being happy what does what does happy mean and you might think well happy Means getting what you want Happy is how you feel after Christmas dinner it's like no that's a sleep right that's content and asleep now that's a that's a form of contentment but it isn't really what people mean when they say that they want to be happy the happiness that people refer to when they talk about happiness has more to do with enthusiasm and enthusiasm is an interesting word because it it means it's entheos it means to be inspired inspired is in spirit it means to be imbued with the spirit well enthusiastic is to be imbued with the spirit of God interestingly enough and we'll return to that when do you experience the positive emotion that's associated with happiness the answer is not when you've attained a goal but when you're pursuing one so you're set up your your positive emotion is associated with movement forward you could say that your positive emotion is the psychological equivalent of of forward movement just as your negative emotion is the psychological equivalent of freezing or retreating and so your emotions are very tightly tied to your action Freeze Retreat negative Advance towards a goal positive no goal no positive emotion now if you don't remember anything else from tonight that's a good thing to remember no goal no positive emotion Accord of that as well is no goal confusion so no goal not only means no positive emotion it also means confusion and confusion means anxiety and Dread and so a life without a goal is confusing and hopeless and that begs a question what should the goal be and that's partly what we're trying to establish you wrote for 15 minutes you try to develop a vision for your life now you have something to move toward that sets up the precondition for potential positive emotion and happiness what else do you need to motivate you well how about negative emotion so what do you do with that well negative emotion can stop you you might think well I'd like to get a better job but I'm afraid of I'm afraid of putting myself out in the job market I'm afraid of being evaluated I'm afraid that if I tried something more difficult I might fail then you have your negative emotion opposing you right it's anxiety is stopping you and fair enough because there are things to be anxious about but what if you could get your negative emotion behind you pushing you instead of stopping you sometimes in my clinical practice I would have clients who hated their job they're laboring under the thumb of a tyrant and maybe that was partly because they turned themselves into slaves but it didn't matter they were laboring under the thumb of a tyrant they needed to make a move laterally or up they needed to make a move and they were often afraid to and they had they had their reasons they didn't want to contemplate their resumés they didn't want to open up their CVS they didn't want to face the inadequacies of their past they were afraid of being evaluated they were afraid of being rejected they didn't know how to negotiate they didn't know how to conduct themselves an interview they're afraid of losing the security they'd already built up they had their fears and they were real and those fears stopped them but they'd come to me and say oh my God you know I'm so miserable and my life is so miserable and we take that apart and one of the reasons was because they were laboring under the thumb of a tyrant and then we talk that through and they'd say well I'm afraid to make a change and I'd say that's okay that's understandable how afraid are you not of not making a change let's make a little vision of that you're 35 you hate your job what's the consequence you're not motivated you don't want to get out of bed in the morning you're starting to get depressed you're getting bitter you're getting resentful you're getting cynical you're amotivated at work you're not doing a very good job and you're starting to shrink now play that out for 10 years you don't change it you don't fix it and what happens it's not like it's going to get better of its own accord what's going to happen to you well for sure at minimum what's going to happen to you is you're going to be in the same situation but 10 years older and if you can't get out of that situation now what the hell makes you think you're going to get out of it in 10 years you're 10 years older you're 10 years more bitter you're 10 years more cynical Maybe by that time your marriage is collapsed because who the hell wants to live with you you you're even more of a slave than you were because you've labored another 10 years under the thumb of the Tyrant and stepped backwards every time you were asked to so you got smaller and smaller as the Tyrant got bigger and bigger it's like think about that and that means imagine it imagine that okay now that's the situation you're stuck where you are but it's 10 years from now and I when I say think of that I mean imagine that it's like really play it out like you know how miserable you are now you're afraid of making the necessary changes but you know how miserable you are now just imagine how miserable you could be in 10 years and in all likelihood what you'll find is that you're way more afraid of that than you are of whatever's stopping you in the present it's really useful to know what your own particular brand of Hell might be and so one of the things we do in this writing exercise is have people do the reverse like like okay so imagine now 5 years from now you've let whatever Temptations you're particularly susceptible to have the upper hand and they've augured you into the ground you know one person's an alcoholic another person's a criminal another person's living on the street someone else is like skirting the edges of prostitution somebody else is narcissistic and bitter somebody else is depressed and anxious you know where you would fall off the edge of the Earth if you fell off in whatever Direction you're prone to fall off everyone knows that but we avoid that you know that's that's rule three do not hide things in the fog is that the rule do not hide unwanted things in the fog yeah well we often won't allow ourselves to imagine the catastrophe that we're pursuing let's say through inaction that's a good thing to fix so now you say well you you you think for 15 minutes that's not very long but who you could be and what you could have if you could have what you wanted if you were who you could be and then you think about what sort of hell you could produce for yourself if you didn't do that and that's not a bad polarity it's like I'm going to get away from that and I'm going to move towards that and then you have your negative emotion working for you and your positive emotion working for you and that's a good gradient and that's a great gradient to emotionally because as I said you don't experience positive emotion except in relationship to a goal and if you got a nice gradient on your goal Pursuit then that's going to increase the degree to which you feel positive emotion and positive Emotion by the way isn't just about being happy that's the most trivial part of it in some sense positive emotion allows you to focus it it's it's the sole of concentration it's the it's the essence of enthusiastic motivation when you say I really want to do that that statement is predicated on the existence of positive emotion it's the fact that the goal beckons to you that makes you say I want to do that and you know how much easier it is to do something you want to do than to do something you don't want to do and that ease is actually a consequence of the activation of the system that governs positive emotion and you might ask yourself well how powerful a system is that and I would say well almost all of the drugs of abuse that people are most prone to abusing are abused because they activate the positive emotion system so cocaine methamphetamine heroin is also a painkiller but it has a POS it has a psychomotor stimulant element that's the technical term for the the pharmacological effect of pharmacological agents on the positive emotion system psycho stimulation psych motor because it's associated with movement forward cocaine is such a powerful drug because it makes you feel like you're doing something worthwhile that's the system it hyperactivates and so is a primary system of motivation it's as old as forward movement itself it's a cardinal source of meaning and it only manifests itself in relationship to a [Music] goal

e34RNgLdzCY,1928577,29793,14000,"BREAKING NEWS: Trump, South Africa President Have Shocking Argument About White Farmer Death Claims",20250521,"for you to be convinced that there's no genocide. Please. Thank you, Mr. President. So, May 25th will be the celebration of Africa Day, which pretty much a lot of celebration will be taking place around the world, including here in the United States. What is your message to the entire African continent, African people in this important location? Well, I want to see peace and I want to see happiness. I want to see health and you know you have incredible land there's tremendous value a lot of countries don't have that value in the land the value you have you know we have a situation I think you probably heard about it we've uh done through some very talented people helped settle a war that's been raging for years Rwanda and the Congo and I think we've done it believe it or not I think we've done it and uh could you just say a few words about that my friend Yes, a couple of weeks ago we signed they signed the two parties signed declaration of principle in which they've agreed on the way forward and we're they have both submitted uh draft peace agreements and we we have put together one that incorporates both of their suggestions and we've given it to them. So we're in the process of finalizing this looking very good. No, we have to thank you for even those efforts because the African continent, particularly Saddak, our southern African development community, has for years been seeking to foster peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. So all efforts including those from outside the continent and inside the continent are really worthwhile. We have just we are rem removing our troops from there so that peace can then prevail in that whole area and uh we hope that with the support of the international community uh we will really have peace in that area. It's so vital so important for the whole region. Well, we sent our people there uh and uh I think we did a very good job. I said it by my friend and that was great. That was great. And I mean, I'm just hearing phenomenal reports because all I'm hearing is death, death, and they're chopping heads off and it's horrible over there and uh it was really brave of you to go there and I really appreciate it and it looks like that it looks like we have something very very substantial. We also talked about trade with them in terms of rare earth and all but uh really more for the it's like uh if you take a look at what we just did with Pakistan and India we settled that whole thing and I think I settled it through trade. We're we're doing a big deal with India. We're doing a big deal with Pakistan. And I said what are you guys doing? You know they somebody had to be the last one to shoot. But the shooting was getting worse and worse, bigger and bigger, deeper and deeper into the countries and uh we spoke to him and we I think we you know I hate to say we got it settled and then two days later something happens and they say it's Trump's fault but uh we Pakistan is got some excellent people and some really good great leader and India is my friend Modi Modi and he's a mutual friend. Yeah, he's a great guy. And I called them both and we we just uh did something good. We uh were trying to settle Russia Ukraine. You spoke with President Putin for two and a half hours the day before yesterday. I think we made a lot of progress, but that's a bloodbath. 5,000 people are being killed a week. 5,000 soldiers a week, not including people in cities and towns that are also being killed. So, we're trying to help. And it doesn't affect us. It's not our people. It's not our soldiers. It's not our It's Ukraine and it's Russia. But if we can save 5,000 souls, we'll do it. You know, we're pretty good at it. But it's a that's a bad situation. That is a really bad situation. Well, you recall when President Zilinski was coming to South Africa, that's when I spoke to you. That's right. We both agreed that we need to push the peace message so that there can really be peace. And we've been involved uh in the Ukraine Russia conflict for quite a while through my minister of state security here. We've been dealing with them the exchange of children who were taken away going through names and addresses and all that. So we've been invested in that whole process as well and the moves that you are making are fully supported by us because we would like to see the end of that war. That's true. And I called Zalinski and they said, ""He's in South Africa."" I said, ""What the hell is he doing in South Africa?"" He was talking to us. We got this. That's a strange They said, ""What are you doing in South Africa?"" That's a strange one. He's trying to make peace. But we we taking him, you know, we were we were lucky because we had the great Nelson Mandela who taught us how to create peace, to make peace. So we were imparting some of those lessons to him, some of those learnings. And I specifically mentioned to him that this is how Nelson Manella taught us uh that when you want to have a peace in a country, do it on an unconditional basis and sit down and talk. And that's precisely what I'm sure he's going to hear. Well, we're going to see what happens with that one. It's a lot of there's a lot of hatred, there's a lot of uh a lot of death. It's a blood bath. So it is I get the unfortunately I get the satellite pictures of that field of that killing field. You never saw anything like it in your life. It's horrible. It's a horrible thing that it goes on. But I think we've made big progress. Yeah, please go ahead. Thank you, Mr. President. No, no, not you. Right here. He's from South Africa. Go ahead, please. What are you expecting on the ICJK? Are you expecting South Africa to drop that? Is that what you're trying to on which case? The international criminal justice I don't expect anything to be honest. I really don't I don't know. It's they've got uh a case there's a lot of anger there. Tremendous anger. I don't expect anything. We'll see what happens. We'll have a ruling and who knows what the ruling is going to mean. Yeah. On that subject of Gaza, um Mr. Mr. President, are you going to be speaking to Prime Minister Netanyahu about Israel's renewed defense in there? Been a lot of concern from European countries. The Pope has expressed concern. Are you going to be asking Prime Minister Netanyahu to tone down the offensive in Gaza to let more aid in? Was that a question or a statement? You never change. Mr. President, this what does it take from you for you to be convinced that there's no white genocide in South Africa? Well, I can answer that for president. It's for him. No, seriously. I'd rather have him answer. Yeah, I'd rather answer that. It will be our president will respond to you. Thank you, Mr. President. It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here. When we have talks between us on the quiet around a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I'm not going to be repeating what I've been saying. I would say if there was Africana farmer genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen would not be here, including my minister of agriculture. He would not be with me. So it'll take him, President Trump listening to their stories, to their perspective. That is the answer to your question. But Mr. President, I must say, we have No, no, wait. Uh, we have thousands of stories talking about it and we have documentaries. We have news stories on that. Is Natalie here? Somebody here to turn that. I could show you a couple of things and I would I just I have to it has to be responded to. Sure. We have Let me see the articles please if you would and turn Excuse me. Turn the lights down. Turn the lights down and just put this on. It's right behind you. Johan, there's nothing this parliament can do with or without you. People are going to occupy land. We require no permission from you, from the president, from no one. We don't care. We can do whatever you want to do. Who are you to tell us whether we can occupy land or not? We are going to occupy land. South Africa occupy land. That's who we are. I can use [Music] must never be scared to kill.

The farmer. burn the [Applause] po I don't know what's going to happen in the future I'm saying to you was not called for the killing of white people at least for now I can't see the future I mean you don't understand something watching that especially as it gets shared on Twitter they freak out it sounds like a motorcycle [Music] So [Music] children over who will expropriate land without compensation whether they like it or not. If they object, they can seek refugee in America. Now, this is very bad. These are the these are burial sites right here. Burial sites over a thousand of white farmers. And those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday morning. Each one of those white things you see is across. And there's approximately a thousand of them. They're all white farmers, the family of white farmers. And those cars aren't uh driving. They're stopped there to pay respects to their family member who was killed. Uh and it's a terrible sight. I've never seen anything like it. Both sides of the road you have crosses. [Music] Those people are all killed. Have they told you where that is, Mr. President? No. I'd like to know where that is because this I've never seen. without. Okay. I mean, it's in South Africa. That's where we need to find out. [Music] Those people [Music] Okay, Mr. President, the Pentagon announced that it would be accepting a Qatari jet to be used as Air Force One. What are you talking about? You know, what are you talking about? You know, you to get out of here. What does this have to do with the guitar jet? Uh, they're giving the United States Air Force a jet. Okay. And it's a great thing. We're talking about a lot of other things. It's NBC trying to get off the subject of what you just saw. You are a real you know, you're a terrible reporter. Number one, you you don't have what it takes to be a reporter. You're not smart enough. But for you to go on to a subject about a a jet that was given to the United States Air Force, which is a very nice thing, they also gave 5.1 trillion dollars worth of investment in addition to the jet. go back uh you ought to go back to your studio at NBC because uh Brian Roberts and the people that run that place, they ought to be investigated. They are so terrible the way you run that network and you're a disgrace. No more questions from you. Go ahead. Go ahead. Talk about that. His name is Peter something. He's a terrible reporter. Quiet. Quiet. Let's go. Thank you so much, President Trump, Adam from ENCA in South Africa. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Uh what would you like President Ramapo to do about the situation that we've just seen on the screen? I don't know. Uh or look, these are articles over the last few days. Uh death of people. Death. Death. Death. Horrible death. Death. I don't know. But you know to pick anyone. White South Africans are fleeing because of the violence and racist laws. And this is all I mean I'll give these to you. So when you when you say what would I like to do? I don't know what to do. Look at this. White South African couples say that they were attacked violently. And President Trump, when will you go and see for yourself if it isn't? Well, I could do that. Look, here's burial sites all over the place. They're all these are all white farmers that are being buried. And he asks about a jet that was given. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You know, you're you are so bad. You're such a bad reporter. President Trump. Mr. President, this is one after another. This family was wiped out. I just I'm just looking reaction to those videos, Mr. President. Well, I think it's I think the videos are so No, no. When you look at the videos, I mean, how does it get worse? And these are people that are officials and they're saying that kill the white farmer and take their land. That's what I'm And I have other friends in South Africa. I have people that left, one in particular that says it's you you can't go there. He said they want to take your land. They take your land and they kill you. It's okay. And they say it's okay to do. Now I we we're going to talk about it. But this is a tremendous look. This is story recent. These are all people that recently got killed. Yeah. And I don't know how it can get any worse. And you know the man that you saw, the men that you saw, the people that you saw on that movie, those are officials. Those are people that were in office. They had one march. They had a dance in your parliament, whatever you may call it, legislature. Let me clarify that. Let me clarify that because what you saw the speeches that were being made, one that is not government policy. We have a multi-party democracy in South Africa that allows people to express themselves, political parties to adhere to various policies and in many cases or in some cases those policies do not go along with government policy. Our government policy is completely completely against what he was saying even in the parliament and they a small minority party which is allowed to exist in terms of our constitution but you do allow them to take land. No no no you do allow them to take land. Nobody can take and then when they take the land they kill the white farmer and when they kill the white farmer nothing happens to them. No, there is quite nothing happens to them. There is criminality in our country. People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity are not only white people. Majority of them are black people. And we have now black. The farmers are not black. I don't say that's good or bad, but the farmers are not black. and the people that are being killed in large numbers and you saw all those grave sites and those are people that loved ones going I guess on a Sunday morning they told me to pay respect to their loved ones that were killed their heads chopped off their they died died violently and you know I mean we're here to talk about it and I didn't know we'd get involved here but I will say this that if the news wasn't fake like NBC which is fake news. Totally. One of the worst. ABC, NBC, CBS. Horrible. But if they weren't fake news, like this jerk uh that we have here. If we had real reporters, they'd be covering it. But the fake news in this country doesn't talk about that. They don't want to talk about it. But now they have to talk about it. But they won't. This won't even be a subject. They'll have him talking about why did uh a country give a free think. Think of this. Why did a country give an airplane to the United States Air Force? Okay, the United States, not to me, to the United States Air Force so they could help us out because we need an Air Force One until our That's Air Force One. It's being built. Two of them being built. But Boeing's a little bit late, unfortunately. So why did they give us a plane to the United States Air Force? That's what that idiot talks about after viewing a thing where thousands of people are dead. I'm I'm sorry. I don't have a plane to give you. I would I wish you did. I take it. I would take it. If your country offered the United States Air Force a plane, I would take it. Okay. But coming back to to this issue which I really would like us to talk about and talk about it very calmly. We were taught by Nelson Mandela that whenever there are problems, people need to sit down around a table and talk about them. This is precisely what we would also like to talk about including of course trade matters, investment matters. So the issues that concern you as the United States, those are all recent and those are all deaths. Yeah. In many ways, I mean, one one should say you are a partner partner of South Africa and you are raising concerns and these are concerns that we are willing to talk to you about. Let me just add quickly, you know, the criminality that we are expect experiencing in our country needs quite a lot of technological uh capability and uh in one of our areas in in South Africa, we're using US technology which is able to in many ways identify where shootings are happening and all that. And I'd like to talk about that because there is support that we can get from you and the United States to help us deal with all these acts of criminality. And that is what I believe partnership is all about. And we are here as a partner so that we can help each other uh whenever there are challenges. So I'd like us to discuss it and of course outside of the media so that we sit down and have a really good discussion that will lead to good outcomes. Are there any other punitive measures that could be in place should you not be satisfied that South Africa is fixing some of the very bad things that you tweeted are happening. Well, there are a lot of bad things happening in, you know, many countries, but this in particular has been very, very bad. Very bad. And because of, you know, we're going to whole have the whole world watching in another short period of time because you have the G20. And that's a big deal. And it seems it seems like I mean, I want you to look good. I I don't want you to look bad. Very good. But you we have hundreds of people, thousands of people trying to come into our country because they feel they're going to be killed and their land is going to be confiscated. And you do have laws that were passed that gives you the right to confiscate land for no payment. You can take away land for no payment. But I want to clarify that because we have a constitution. Our constitution guarantees and protects the sanctity of tenure of land ownership. And that constitution protects all South Africans with regard to land ownership. However, we do say because we've got to deal with the past, the government and as your government also has the right to expropriate land for public use and you're doing that and uh what we we've never really gotten underway with that and we we are going to be doing that. You're taking you're taking people's land away. We have not from them. And those people in many cases are being executed. They're being executed. And they happen to be white and most of them happen to be farmers. And that's a tough situation. I don't know how you explain that. How do you explain that? They're taking people's land away. And in many cases, those people are being executed. And in many cases, it's not the government that's suing, it's people that kill them and then take their land and nothing happens to them. But we have thousands of people that want to come into our country. They're also going to Australia in a smaller number, but we have thousands of people that want to come into our country and they're white farmers and they feel that uh they're going to die in South Africa and it's a bad thing.

THANKS FOR THE TIME. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> Bret: FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATS ON BECOMING A GRANDFATHER FOR THE 11TH TIME. TIFFANY, BABY ALEXANDER. >> GREAT COUPLE. THE BABY IS PERFECT. I WILL LET YOU KNOW ABOUT IT IN 21 YEARS, BUT THE BABY IS GOOD. WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT THAT IRLOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE BABY. >> Bret: LOVE SEEING YOU WITH THE GRANDKIDS. THIS IS A BIG TRIP. THIS IS SEEN, ESPECIALLY IN THIS REGION, AS A MAJOR, MAJOR SUCCESS WITH THE INTERACTION BETWEEN EACH ONE OF THESE COUNTRIES. HOW DO YOU SEE IT TODAY AS YOU WRAP IT UP? >> WELL, I ALWAYS CONSIDERED IT TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT REGION. I KNOW ALL THREE LEADERS AS YOU COULD SEE VERY WELL. IN ALL THREE CASES, I KNEW THEM LONG BEFORE I RAN FOR POLITICS WHICH IS SORT OF SOMETHING. IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIAL. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. THE THREE OF THEM. THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE. AND IT'S A GREAT REGION, BUT IT WAS NEVER TREATED PROPERLY. AND IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT TREATED WELL BY BIDEN WHO DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS ALIVE, FRANKLY SO, YOU KNOW, CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS NOT -- HE DIDN'T TREAT -- THEY DIDN'T TREAT THIS GROUP WELL. AND I THINK THEY WERE BEING -- I GUESS YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE REPORTED ON IT. THEY WERE BEING COAXED VERY STRONGLY BY CHINA. BECAUSE THAT SOLVES CHINA'S FUEL PROBLEM FOREVER. AND IT WASN'T THEIR PREFERENCE. BUT THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY. THEY WERE GOING TO CHINA. AND THAT WAS GOING TO BE THEIR -- THEIR PARENT. AND THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. >> Bret: YOU THINK YOU HAVE SHIFTED THE PARADIGM ON THAT? >> NO. I DON'T THINK. I KNOW. WE ARE AS CLOSE -- WE'RE CLOSER NOW TO THEM THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU COULD SEE THE RELATIONSHIP. YOU COULD GET A BODY EXPERT AND PAY THEM A LOT OF MONEY AND THEY COULD TELL YOU. NO, THERE IS JUST A RELATIONSHIP THAT I HAVE WITH ALL THREE THAT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, VERY EXTRAORDINARY. I WAS EVEN SAYING, YOU KNOW, WE'RE LIKE SO FRIENDLY. NOT NORMAL SITUATION WHERE, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE OKAY WITH A LEADER OR WHATEVER. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT REGION THIS IS THE ENERGY CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND OTHER THINGS. THEY HAVE INVESTED WISELY. AND THEY ARE LOOKING TO DO OTHER THINGS. IN SAUDI ARABIA, THEY SAID, IN ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS, THERE WILL BE MORE THAN 50% OTHER BUSINESSES REPRESENT MORE THAN 50% OF THE TAKE. AND IT'S PRETTY AMAZING WHAT ALL OF THEM HAVE DONE. >> Bret: YOU HAVE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF BUSINESS INVESTMENT COME BACK TO THE U.S. >> RIGHT. WHICH BY THE WAY MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO SAY GEE, YOU GUYS ARE RICH AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF OIL. YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. AND I WANT THEM TO SPEND THE MONEY IN THE UNITED STATES. AND WE SET RECORDS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TRIP LIKE THIS BY ANY PRESIDENT OR ANYBODY EVER BEFORE. AND I WOULD ASK THEM HOW ABOUT DOUBLING IT UP? OKAY. I SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR MORE. BECAUSE THEY SAID OKAY. THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE. AND THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. AND, LOOK, THEY HAVE GREAT DANGER BECAUSE OF IRAN. THAT'S THEIR PRIMARY DANGER. THAT MAKES THEM VULNERABLE BUT I DON'T SEE THEM AS BEING VULNERABLE BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE -- WE HAVE THE GREATEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD. AND WE'RE ADDING TO IT NOW AT LEVELS THAT NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE IRON DOME. WE DESERVE AN IRON DOME. WE CALL IT TWO NAMES. I WAS GOING TO CALL IT THE IRON DOME BECAUSE THAT'S THE NAME EVERYONE HAS HEARD OF FOR YEARS. TO ME IT WAS OLD FASHIONED. SO WE CHANGED IT RECENTLY TO THE GOLDEN DOME, THE BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN DOME. AND. >> MATCHES THE GOLDEN AGE. >> RONALD REAGAN WANTED THAT MANY YEARS AGO AND HE WAS RIGHT EXEMPT YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR THE TECHNOLOGY. >> Bret: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ISRAEL. THE FIRST TRIP IN THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION, WHEN YOU CAME OVER TO THE MIDDLE EAST. DID YOU DO A STOP IN ISRAEL ON THE WAY BACK. NOT DOING IT THIS TIME. OBVIOUSLY THE ISRAEL, HAMAS AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN GAZA IS DRIVING A LOT. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT? ARE YOU FRUSTRATED AT ALL WITH PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU? >> NO. LOOK. HE HAS GOT A TOUGH SITUATION. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, THERE WAS AN OCTOBER 7TH THAT EVERYONE FORGETS. ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT DAYS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. NOT THE MIDDLE EAST, THE WORLD. YOU LOOK AT THE TAPES. THE TAPING ARE THERE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE. SO, HE HAS THAT PROBLEM AND THAT PROBLEM NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. IF I WERE PRESIDENT. THAT PROBLEM WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE IRAN HAD NO MONEY. THEY WERE STONE COLD BROKE AND THEY WEREN'T GIVING MONEY TO HAMAS. IN FACT, I REMEMBER ON YOUR SHOW, LIKE A YEAR BEFORE THAT, YOU WERE SAYING, THERE IS NO MONEY FOR HEZBOLLAH, HAMAS, LIKE 28 DIFFERENT GROUPS. >> Bret: THE HOUTHIS. >> THE HOUTHIS. 28 GROUPS THAT WE KNOW OF. NONE OF THEM, THEY ARE ALL BREAKING UP BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MONEY. THEN, BIDEN CAME ALONG AND TOOK OFF ALL THE SANCTIONS ON IRAN. I PUT SANCTIONS THAT WERE SO STRONG. ANYBODY THAT DID BUSINESS WITH IRAN COULD NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED STATES. SO, EVERYBODY TOOK A PASS. INCLUDING CHINA. BIDEN CAME IN, HE JUST LET EVERYONE GO BY AND THEY HAVE OVER $300 BILLION TODAY. >> Bret: SO HOW DO YOU GET TO A SOLUTION THERE? >> WE'LL GET. 100 PERCENT. >> Bret: YOU THINK SO. >> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SOLUTION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE VIOLENT OR NOT VIOLENT. I FAR PREFER NONVIOLENT. I DON'T WANT -- I KNOW SO MANY IRANIANS FROM NEW YORK, FROM WASHINGTON, FROM DIFFERENT -- THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO VIEW THEM AS PEOPLE I DON'T WANT IT TO BE VIOLENT THING. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A VIOLENT WEAPON. >> Bret: YOU SAID IT WAS CLOSE THE OTHER DAY. CLOSE A DEAL. >> DOES THAT MEAN ENRICH AT ANY LEVEL CIVILIAN LEVEL? >> NO, I THINK THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. YOU SAY TO YOURSELF THEY HAVE MASSIVE OIL BY THE WAY. THEY HAVE OIL THAT LASTS FOR 300 YEARS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF OIL. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THEY ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD. VERY GOOD OIL. MEANING IT'S PURE, PERFECT STUFF. THEY DON'T HAVE TO SPEND A FORTUNE ON GASES AND ENERGY IN ORDER TO MELT THE ROCK AND EVERYTHING. THEY HAVE PURE, UNADULTERATED GOOD OIL. AND, YOU SAY WHY DOES SOMEBODY THAT HAS THAT KIND OF OIL, OTHER THAN BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT, BUT WHEN YOU HAVE UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF OIL AND GAS. WHY ARE YOU PUTTING UP -- YOU KNOW, WHY DO YOU NEED CIVIL NUCLEAR? I JUST DON'T SEE IT. >> Bret: ARE YOU GOING TO CALL FOR IT ALL. >> I THINK NUCLEAR IS FINE FOR CIVIL, IF YOU HAVE A COUNTRY WITH NO OIL. BUT IF YOU ARE SITTING ON ONE OF THE LARGEST PILES OF OIL IN THE WORLD, WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT PUTTING UP NUCLEAR CIVIL. I CALL IT NUCLEAR CIVIL. >> Bret: SO BIBI NETANYAHU IS NOT CONVINCED THAT A DEAL WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE REGION. IS THAT FAIR TO SAY? >> I THINK I CAN SAY THAT BIBI, HE IS AN ANGRY MAN. AND HE SHOULD BE BECAUSE OF OCTOBER 7TH. AND HE HAS BEEN HURT BADLY BY THAT. BUT, IN ANOTHER WAY HE HAS BEEN SORT OF HELPED BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS FOUGHT HARD AND BRAVELY. >> YOU THINK ISRAEL, HAMAS, THE SITUATION IN GAZA IS GOING TO COME TO AN END, SOON? >> GAZA IS A NASTY PLACE. IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR YEARS. I THINK IT SHOULD BECOME A FREE ZONE. I CALL IT A FREEDOM ZONE. IT SHOULD BECOME A FREEDOM ZONE. IT DOESN'T WORK. EVERY 10 YEARS THEY GO BACK. THEY HAVE HAMAS. THEY HAVE -- BEING KILLED ALL OVER THE PLACE. DO YOU EVER SEE -- YOU TALK ABOUT CRIME STATS. IT'S NASTY PLACE. >> Bret: ARE THESE PEOPLE, THESE COUNTRIES THAT YOU WERE JUST VISITING, ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION? >> THEY WOULD BE. I SPOKE TO ALL THREE OF THEM. THEY ABSOLUTELY WOULD BE. THEY ARE REALLY RICH AND REALLY REALLY REALLY, EVEN MORE THAN RICH. THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE. AND THEY WOULD HELP SO, MONEY IS NOT EVEN THE PROBLEM. >> Bret: YOU GOT TO GET COUNTRIES TO SAY YES TO TAKE THEM. >> WELL, LOOK. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY REALLY WANT TO BE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY LOVE THE MIDDLE EAST. I SEE THAT THERE IS A SPIRIT FOR THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO SWEDEN, GERMANY, THESE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THEY HAVE BEEN HOME IN THE MIDDLE EAST IF SOMEBODY HAD THE BRAINS TO BUILD BEAUTIFUL COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW, 1.9 MILLION IS A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT IT'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE RELATIVELY. >> Bret: YOU HAD A COUPLE OF FOREIGN POLICY SUCCESSES EVEN RIGHT BEFORE THIS TRIP. YOU PICKED UP THE PHONE AND CALLED TWO NUCLEAR POWERS, INDIA AND PAKISTAN AND GOT THEM TO STEP BACK FROM THE BRINK. THAT WAS A SUCCESS AS YOU GOT ON THE PLANE HEADING OVER HERE. >> A BIGGER SUCCESS THAN I WILL EVER BE GIVEN CREDIT FOR. THOSE ARE MAJOR NUCLEAR POWERS. THOSE ARE NOT LIKE A LITTLE BIT. AND THEY WERE ANGRY. AND THE NEXT PHASE WAS PROBABLY -- DID YOU SEE WHERE IT WAS GETTING -- IT WAS TIT-FOR-TAT. IT WAS GETTING DEEPER AND MORE. I MEAN, MORE MISSILES. EVERYONE WAS STRONGER, STRONGER. TO A POINT WHERE THE NEXT ONES ARE GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW WHAT, THE ""N"" WORD. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE N WORD IS, RIGHT? >> Bret: NUCLEAR. >> YEAH. >> Bret: THANK YOU FOR THE VERIFICATION. >> I FIGURED YOU WOULD WANT TO CLEAN THAT UP IT'S A VERY NASTY WORD IN A LOT OF WAYS. THE ""N"" WORD USED IN A NUCLEAR SENSE. THAT'S THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN. I THINK THEY WERE VERY CLOSE, THE HATRED WAS GREAT. AND I SAID, WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TRADE. WE'RE GO TO DO A LOT OF TRADE. DON'T FORGET IRAN WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL WITH US. BADLY FOR A LOT OF REASONS. BUT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT INDIA, THEY ARE CALLING -- YOU KNOW, IRAN WANTS TO TRADE WITH US, OKAY, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT I'M OKAY WITH IT. I'M USING TRADE TO SETTLE SCORES AND TO MAKE PEACE. I HAVE TOLD IRAN, WE MAKE A DEAL YOU ARE GOING TO BE REALLY HAPPY. BUT, MORE THAN ANYTHING, I HAVE TOLD IRAN VERY SIMPLY BECAUSE I HEARD SOMEBODY MAKING MY CASE LAST NIGHT ON TELEVISION, I DIDN'T LIKE IT. BECAUSE THEY WERE SAYING THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME. THERE IS NOT PLENTY OF TIME. THERE IS NOT PENTAGON PLENTY OF TIME. >> Bret: YOU FEEL THE URGENCY? >> WELL, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND EVENTUALLY THEY WILL HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. AND THEN THE DISCUSSION BECOMES A MUCH DIFFERENT ONE. IN THE CASE OF INDIA, INDIAENS WANTS, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE ONE OF THE HIGHEST TAXED OR TARIFFED NATIONS IN THE WORLD. THEY MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO BUSINESS. DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO CUT 100 PERCENT OF THEIR TARIFFS FOR THE UNITED STATES. >> Bret: IS THAT DEAL COMING SOON. >> YEAH. THAT WILL COME SOON. I'M IN NO RUSH. LOOK, EVERYBODY WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL WITH US. >> Bret: SOUTH KOREA? >> SOUTH KOREA WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL WITH US. >> Bret: INDIA, JAPAN. >> I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE DEALS WITH EVERYBODY. I WILL SET THE LIMIT. I WILL MAKE SOME DEALS. AND THEN I'M JUST -- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MEET WITH THAT MANY PEOPLE. I HAVE GOT 150 COUNTRIES THAT WANT TO MAKE DEALS. YOU HAVE A LOT OF COUNTRIES. BRET MARKET WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH THE CHINA SITUATION AND THE SIT DOWN. >> THEY WERE. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT IF I DIDN'T DO THAT DEAL WITH CHINA, I THINK CHINA WOULD HAVE BROKEN APART. >> Bret: NOT US. THEM? >> WE WEREN'T GOING TO BREAK. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BREAK. THEY WOULD HAVE BROKEN APART. YOU KNOW, OUR COUNTRY HAS A LOT OF SPIRIT. DO YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE OF NOVEMBER 5TH. BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY HAS SPIRIT AGAIN. >> Bret: THE OTHER FOREIGN POLICY SHIFT WAS THIS EMBRACE OF SYRIA. AND YOU MET WITH THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT. WHO HAS A -- YOU KNOW, A SHADY PAST OF BEING TIED TO AL-QAEDA AND HE WILL NEWS ARE A FRONT IN SYRIA. YOU SEE PROMISE THERE. >> BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THAT, JUST ONE WORD. >> Bret: YEAH. >> ALSO PAKISTAN. GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH PAKISTAN. YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T FORGET THEM. AND BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE TWO TO TANGO. AND WITH INDIA, I FELT VERY CERTAIN AND WITH PAKISTAN I ALSO TALKED ABOUT TRADE. OH, THEY WOULD LOVE TO TRADE. THEY WOULD LOVE TO TRADE. YOU KNOW, THEY ARE BRILLIANT PEOPLE. THEY MAKE INCREDIBLE PRODUCTS. AND WE DON'T DO MUCH TRADING WITH THEM. AND, YET, I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP -- I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. BUT I STOPPED THAT WAR. THAT WAS GOING TO BE A NUCLEAR WAR, I THINK OR CLOSE. VERY CLOSE. YOU WERE RIGHT THERE. >> Bret: YEAH. >> AND NOW EVERYONE IS HAPPY. OF COURSE IN, I TOLD MY PEOPLE, CALL THEM UP, LET'S START TRADING IMMEDIATELY. BECAUSE I'M A MAN OF MY WORD. NOW, WHEN YOU GET TO SYRIA. SO I DID SOMETHING WITH SYRIA BECAUSE THE FUTURE KING AND OFF WONDERFUL KING RIGHT NOW. HE IS AN OLDER MAN. HE IS ALSO A FRIEND OF MINE. AND HE IS 100 PERCENT SHARP. HE'S GREAT. AND HE HAS A GREAT SON, THE CROWN PRINCE. AND HE HAS ACTUALLY MANY TITLES, PRIME MINISTER, HE IS CROWN PRINCE AND HE IS DOING A GREAT JOB RUNNING IT. HE CALLED ME AND SPOKE TO ME. HE SAID COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR? COULD YOU -- AND DO THE WORLD A FAVOR? COULD YOU TAKE THE SANCTIONS OFF SYRIA BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE, THE SANCTIONS ARE CRIPPLING. THAT'S WHAT I DID WITH IRAN. THEY CAME TO A POINT WHERE THEY WERE BUST. COULD YOU TAKE THE SANCTIONS OFF? I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT MUCH. AND HE SAID IT IN A WAY THAT -- YOU KNOW, HE HAS A GREAT HEART. HE SAID THEY KANTZ MAKE IT REQUEST THOSE SANCTIONS I SAID LET'S GIVE THEM A CHANCE. I MET THE NEW LEADER. AND HANDSOME GUY, BY THE WAY. YOUNG, HANDSOME. AND I SAID YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE QUITE A PAST. YOU HAVE HAD A TOUGH PAST. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. ARE YOU GOING TO PUT A CHOIR BOY IN THAT POSITION? I DON'T THINK SO. YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT TOUGH. >> Bret: YOU ARE WILLING TO GIVE THEM A SHOT. >> IT'S A NASTY NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S A ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD. >> Bret: YEAH. >> AND I THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY -- YEAH, I THOUGHT HE WAS TERRIFIC. HE WAS SO THANKFUL ABOUT THE SANCTIONS BECAUSE HE KNEW HE IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUST THROUGH. >> Bret: MAYBE IT WILL BE A TURN THERE? WE WILL SEE. >> I THINK HE HAS A REAL CHANCE. HE'S A STRONG GUY. HE HAS DONE SOME PRETTY TOUGH THINGS. >> Bret: A LOT OF THE COVERAGE HERE IS ABOUT SPEECH IN SAUDI ARABIA TRUSTING COUNTRIES. NOT TRYING TO MAKE A MIRROR IMAGE OF OURSELVES. >> WE HAVE OUR OWN PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW? GLA. >> Bret: A LOT OF THE COVERAGE BACK HOME WAS ABOUT THIS DONATION OF THE QATAR, BOEING JET. >> UNTIL YOU BRING THIS UP NOW I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT IT FOR THREE DAYS. WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT. >> >> Bret: BRIEFLY. I HEARD ALL THE ANSWERS. >> WELL, NO, YOUR AUDIENCE HAS TO HEAR THE ANSWERS. TO BE FAIRLY SIMPLE. THEY ARE GIVING IT TO THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE/DEFENSE DEPARTMENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE NOT GIVING IT TO ME. I MADE A GOOD DEAL. WE NEED A PLANE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE WE GET THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE BOEING IS VERY LATE. BOEING IS SADLY. >> Bret: DID YOU TALK TO THE CEO? >> IN THE MEANTIME I GOT THEM 160 PLANES TO BUILD. HOW ABOUT THE PLANE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BUILD FOR OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE DIFFERENT THEY'RE EXTREMELY COMPLEX. I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO IT. INSPECTS NOT LIKE A NORMAL PLANE. IT'S NOT LIKE BUILDING A 747 NORMAL. >> Bret: PUT PEOPLE ON THE MOON BEFORE GETTING THE BOEING AIR FORCE ONE. >> BOEING, THESE PEOPLE KNOW. THEY ARE VERY SMART DOWN HERE. THEY SUGGESTED IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING AT ALL TO HELP BECAUSE WE HAVE 40-YEAR-OLD PLANES RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW OUR AIR FORCE ONE WAS ACTUALLY TWO PLANES. TWO 747s. >> I DON'T KNOW PEOPLE KNOW THAT FOUR DECADES OLD THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE. >> MORE THAN THAT I THINK THEY ARE 42 NOW. I HAVE BEEN SAYING 40 FOR TWO YEARS. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A 42-YEAR-OLD PLANE. YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE IS NOTHING UNSAFE ABOUT IT, IN MANY CASES JUST AS SAFE OR MORE SAFE. THEY ARE HEAVIER ARE, THEY THROW OUT A LOT MORE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS. THEY THROW OUT A LITTLE MORE THAN A MODERN ENGINE TO THROW OUT. THEY ARE GOOD BUT THEY ARE 42 YEARS OLD. AND WHEN WE LANDED I SAW THE OTHER DAY WHEN WE LANDED WE PARKED RIGHT NEXT TO THE 747 OF QATAR. AND WE PARKED NEXT TO ANOTHER 747 TWO OR THROW OF THEM WHICH THE ARAB WORLD HAS. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT A NEW 747 AND YOU LOOK AT A PLANE THAT'S 42 YEARS OLD. NOT EVEN THE SAME PLANE, THE OTHER ONES ARE BIGGER AND SLEEKER AND SHARPER AND, IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BOEING. NOW, AGAIN, IT'S A VERY COMPLEX PLANE. IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT PLANE THAN THE NORMAL PLANE WOULD BE. OKAY. THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. THEY ARE COMING BACK AND COMING BACK STRONG. I'M ANGRY WITH THEM FOR THE TWO PLANES. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO KNOCK THEM OFF IN NO TIME AND THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT. HE SAID GREAT GENTLEMAN TO ME HE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO HELP IF YOU WANT. HOW CAN YOU HELP? WE HAPPEN TO HAVE A PLANE. I SAID WELL HAVE YOU BEEN -- HE DOESN'T MEAN ME, ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN GOOD, HE MEANS OUR COUNTRY HAS DEFENDED THEM. AS DONE GREAT THINGS. THEY. >> Bret: HUGE BASE. >> RIGHT NEXT TO IRAN. IS HE RIGHT NEXT TO IT. IS HE NOT LIKE AN HOUR AWAY LIKE I FLEW AN HOUR TO ONE AND HOUR TO HERE. THAT ONE YOU DON'T HAVE TO FLY. ALL YOU HAVE IT DO IS WALK ACROSS THE BORDER. LITERALLY TOUCHING. RIGHT NEXT DOOR. AND HE SAID YOUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN VERY GOOD TO US. I WOULD LOVE TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP WITH THIS SITUATION YOU HAVE WITH AIR FORCE ONE. I SAID THAT'S NICE, WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? HE SUGGESTED THIS. I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S VERY NICE. I APPRECIATE IT WHAT WOULD BE THE PRICE? HE SAID THERE IS NO PRICE. I SAID, HMM, THAT'S NICE. NOW, THIS PLANE IS NOT FOR ME. THIS GOES TO THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE FOR WHOEVER IS PRESIDENT. AND AT SOME POINT IT WILL BE LIKE RONALD REAGAN, IT WILL BE DECOMMISSIONED, YOU KNOW, IT'S 11 YEARS OLD. >> Bret: IT STAYS UNTIL DECOMMISSIONED. >> THEY WON'T WANT IT PLUS THEY HAVE TWO OTHER PLANES AND THEY WILL BE BRAND NEW PLANES, ET CETERA. I WANT TO SAY IT WAS A RADICAL LEFT STORY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING YOU. >> Bret: I ASKED THE PRIME MINISTER ABOUT IT SPECIFICALLY AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE REACTION BACK HOME. AND, YOU KNOW, HE MADE THAT CLEAR. >> I THINK HE WAS INSULTED, ACTUALLY. HE MADE A GIFT TO HELP SOMEBODY THAT HAS HELPED THEM, IT WAS SO NICE AS A GESTURE AND, YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE HERE, TO SHOW YOU HOW CRAZY. THEY WOULD LIKE ME TO PAY A BILLION DOLLARS. I WOULD RATHER PAY A BILLION AND GET 10 FIGHTER JETS INSTEAD OF GIVING A BILLI",0.075,0.729,0.196,1.0

THE OTHER QUESTIONS REMAIN WHAT WILL WE SEE IN THE NON- TARIFF BARRIERS? WE IMPORT THREE TIMES AS MUCH FROM CHINA THAN WHAT THEY IMPORT FROM US.

CURRENCY MANIPULATION THEIR USE OF LABOR TO MAKE THE PRODUCT SO MUCH CHEAPER THERE'S QUESTIONS WHERE THEY WON'T RESPECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MOVING FORWARD WITH AMERICAN FIRMS THAT ARE DOING BUSINESS OVER THERE. A LOT OF DETAILS TO BE IRONED OUT. I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING OUR TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT IS VERY SMART IN THE NEGOTIATION KIND OF SAID WE HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS BUT HE DID NOT SAY THERE IS A DEAL. OTHERS PEOPLE ARE TALKING AS IF THERE'S A DEAL ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WILL SALE THIS DEVELOPS. >> THIS IS WHAT THEY DO TRUMP COMES OUT WITH THE GOOD NEWS BESSON BACKS OFF AND THAT'S KIND OF THE PATTERN IS IN IT?

LET THE IRANIANS KNOW AGAIN ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE. LET'S GET IN ON THE IRAN TALKS. >> ARE ALL TIED TOGETHER IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE TIME DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW IT IS NIGHTTIME OR SCOTT IN THE TRADE REPERTOIRE. SO WHATEVER HAS BEEN DONE HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY UNLESS THEY'RG UP PAST MIDNIGHT. I IRAN, CHINA, THE DEAL WITH US. CHINA IS THE BIG PLAYER IN THE MIDDLE EAST DID BUY THEIR OIL FOR MY RON THEY HAVE A LOT OF POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE MILITARY CLAIMANT WAS USED IN THE PAKISTANI ATTACK IN INDIA. AT THE CENTER OF A LOT OF THIS IS CHINESE GOODS CHINESE CHEAP GOODS THAT DEFICIT HAS TO BE DEALT WITH BECAUSE CHINA GETS THE BENEFIT THAT WORLD GETS THE DEFICIT FRANKLY TO PUT IN THOSE TERMS. WE HAVE GOT TO GET CHINA BACK ON TRACK AS BEST WE CAN TRUMP USES ONE THINK WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN PLAYED YET TO THE POINT OF WHETHER BESSON IS CLEANING UP HE'S REALLY NOT. IT'S TRUMP'S WAY OF OPERATING BECAUSE TRUMP WAS TOLD THE BEFORE AND WE'VE SEEN THIS ALL GO BACK TO THE TABLE IN THE CASE OF UK HE GOT ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS ON THE TABLE IN THE END HE IS THE PRESENT HE WILL MAKE THE DECISION. THEY WORK AS A ONE -- TWO PUNCH WITH CHINA AT THAT MIDDLE OF ATS YOU THINK ABOUT THE SWISS FAMINE AND DECEIT WITH IRAN THERE ARE LINCHPIN TO THAT THEN CHINA. THERE IS A REASON WE ARE THERE BUT IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE PLACE TO DO THE DEAL THERE ARE MULTIPLE PEOPLE THAT CAN BE INVOLVED IN A LOT OF TO BE SAID. TOM: MOLLY THERE SO MUCH NEWS WHEN YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE MONDAY'S NUMBER ONE THING THE WHITE HOUSE IS PUSHING? MOLLY: I THINK THEY ARE PUSHING WHATEVER THEY'VE GOT ON THE TABLE FOR CHINA. THEY ARE TEASING THAT HEADS THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE THE BIGNESS TOMORROW BUT WHAT IT IS, HOPE YOU WILL FIND OUT THEN BUT YOU MENTIONED THAT FORWARD AND BACKWARD MAYBE THE PRESIDENT HAS BIG NEWS I THINK THAT'S A BIG ONE HEAD. IS ANOTHER HEADLINE HERE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKY SAYS HE'S READY TO MEET PERSONALLY WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. THAT IS A WHOLE OTHER PART OF THIS PARADE THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THE DIPLOMACY THIS GOING ON RIGHT NOW OR WE ARE SEEING SOME SUCCESSES POTENTIALLY AND ISRAEL WITH THE POTENTIAL RELEASE OF THIS FINAL AMERICAN THEY ARE STILL HOLDING. IN CHINA WAS IN THE ECONOMICS ES SUCCESS. UKRAINE AND RUSSIA CHALLENGE SEEMS TO STILL BE ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ONES. SURVIVE MOLLY IS FORCING ME TOO CHANGE THE SUBJECT TO THAT VERY THING CHINA IS NOT THE ONLY ADVERSARY MAKING IS TODAY RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN IS PROPOSING DIRECT PEACE TALKS WITH UKRAINE THIS WEEK IN TURKEY TO TRY TO AND THREE PLUS YEARS OF FIGHTING. PRESIDENT TRUMP POSTED TODAY ON TRUTH SOCIAL URGING UKRAINE TO AGREE TO THIS MEETING IMMEDIATELY TO END THE BLOODBATH SEEMINGLY BACKING OFF HIS DEMANDS FOR A 30 DATE CEASE-FIRE BEFORE TALKS COULD START. UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKY IS DOUBLING DOWN ON THE CALLS FOR A CEASE-FIRE. HE SAYS HE WILL BE WAITING FOR PUTIN IN TURKEY ON THURSDAY. OKAY DAVID, I BET YOU HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT THIS. SO PUTIN IS SAYING MAYBE NO CEASE-FIRE WANTS TO START TALKS WHILE THE BULLETS ARE STILL FLYING, WHY IS THAT? >> WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN IT'S BEYOND CHESS AND YOU ARE NOT SURE. RUSSIA HAS A LOT OF INFLUENCE IN TURKEY RIGHT NOW INTO THE RAIL LINES. THEIR INFLUENCE THERE IS IMPORTANT. IT'S ALSO A PLACE TO HEDGE AGAINST NATO OF WHICH TURKEY IS A MEMBER BY STAYING IN A STRONG RELATIONSHIP. SO AT THAT POINT PUTIN MAY BE WILLING TO GO AND HAVE A TALK YOU CAN NEVER READ AHEAD OF WHAT IS GOING TO DO. ZELENSKY HAS HIS OWN PROBLEMS INTERNALLY IN THE UKRAINE. ONE HE'S GOT NO INFRASTRUCTURE OF ANY SORT YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO MAY RETURN FROM THE BATTLEFIELD THERE'S NO MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES, A GOVERNMENT THAT'S FRACTURED HE HAS HIS HARD RIGHT FLANK HE HAS TO FIGURE A WAY OUT OF AND STOP THE BLOODSHED IF HE WANTS TOO. AND FIND A WAY TO KEEP HIMSELF OUT OF THE SIGHTS OF HIS HARD RIGHT FLANK AND THE UKRAINE. GOING TO TURKEY, WAITING FOR PUTIN PUTS THE ONUS ON PUTIN WHO IS COMING OFF OF HIS VICTORY DAY AND A GOOD FEELING IN RUSSIA AND MIGHT MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE MAY BE EASY TO FIND AN OFFRAMP WHICH THE OFFRAMP HAS BEEN OFF THE TABLE FOR A LONG TIME. >> LYDIA WE ARE CERTAINLY IN BETTER SHAPE THAN WE WERE WHEN ZELENSKY WAS HAVING A TENSE MEETING IN THE WHITE HOUSE NOT LONG AGO. LYDIA: START WITH A MINERAL DEAL SIGNS IT SEEMS THE RELATIONSHIP IS PATCHED UP. I WAS JUST THINKING EVEN AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW, THE WEIGHT TALKS ARE PROGRESSING IS EVIDENCE AMERICA FIRST POLICY AGENDA IS WORKING. YOU HAD EUROPEAN LEADERS OVER THE WEEKEND GATHERING WITH THE SILL AND SEAT TO TALK ABOUT HIS SUPPORT THEY ARE PHONING INTO TRUMP THINK THIS IS WHAT WE PROPOSE THIS IS HOW WE WILL SUPPORT A CEASE-FIRE THIS IS HOW WE WILL SUPPORT A PEACE BROKERING THAT IS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WHEN HE WANTS EUROPEAN NATIONS TO STAND STEP FORWARD TO TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PEACE IN THEIR OWN REGION RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE NICETIES TO FIGHT THE BATTLES THAT IT'S BEEN A PRIORITY AT SOMETHING HE HAS BEEN SAYING IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO THINK OR SING IT HAPPENING IN REAL TIME. TOM: THERE'S ALMOST TOO MANY HEADLINES TO DEAL WITH AT THIS POINT RIGHT? WHAT'S THE REALLY ARE INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH ZELENSKY'S CALLING PUTIN OUT DIRECTLY AS WELL. HE SAYS A PERSON I HOPE THIS TIME PUTIN WON'T BE LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE WHY HE CAN'T MAKE IT. SO WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. HOPEFULLY THERE'S BIG PROGRESS THERE AS WELL THERE ARE A LOT OF BALLS UP AND BEING JUGGLED ALL OVER THE GLOBE RIGHT NOW. SUPPORT COMING UP ON A BRAND-NEW OF THE BIG WE CAN SHOW NEW DETAILS ARE BUILT ON THE PRO- HAMAS THUGS WHO STORMED COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. BUT FIRST, A",0.055,0.786,0.159,0.9998
BdTGkd_sbNs,2258509,82983,2900,The True Meaning Of Life (Animated Cinematic),20210919,"every day over 150,000 people die that's over 6,000 people every hour over a 100 people every minute and about two people every single second that means since you started watching this video about 20 people have already died and some of these people got hit by cars others fell off a cliff others may have had a heart attack and others may have simply passed away from natural causes death is one of those things that every single living thing on Earth has in common and death does not discriminate against your skin color or your political beliefs or where you were born or how much money you have no one can escape the incurable disease that we all are blessed with from birth called life and it's interesting because even though we all logically know this very few of us have really internalized this how many of you have really sat down with your eyes closed in an empty room and truly imagined what your funeral would look like like who would even be at your funeral who would be there out of pure obligation and politeness and who would be there because they actually wanted to be there what would people say about you what would they remember and it's weird because you think because we all have this terminal disease called life that we all would be more sympathetic and loving with one another I mean this life disease really is the one thing that all human beings have in common because in 120 years from now every single human being on Earth will be dead and a brand new set of humans will be alive and then in another 120 years after that another brand new set of people will be alive and this is the cycle of life it just goes on and on and on and when you start thinking about life like this you really start to realize how short our time here on Earth really is and you also start to realize that we all are on this journey together as one and it also makes you question the way most people interact with one another like why do so many people get so angry with each other or why do people argue with each other why do people physically harm one another why are there so many parents who yell at their kids or even beat their kids why do so many spouses who supposedly love each other fight all the time why are there siblings who don't speak to each other to this day over some disagreement that took place years ago why do best friends talk badly about each other behind each other's back why do human beings behave like this I think a part of it is because we really have not sat down to really think about what the true meaning of life is and I also think that most people really have not come to terms with the fact that they are not going to be here forever and to be honest I don't really claim to know what the true meaning of life is okay I think it's something that our human brain can't fully logically understand it would kind of be like trying to explain Consciousness to a dog or a cat or something they they just can't understand it however what I will say is there are some things that I think everyone should know and I think the first step to actually understanding a topic like the meaning of life is to First align ourselves with the four truths of the universe and the first truth is the truth of cause and effect which means that every single thing you do or say has some kind of effect on the world around you and yourself for example let's say a number of years ago you lost your temper and you got really mad at a loved one in your life this could be a family member or a friend or even that random person on the street that one single incident where you lost it will have a lingering effect on that person to this day now with that being said it doesn't have to be some huge effect it could be a very mild and small effect and it could be buried deep within their subconscious that isn't necessarily visible on the exterior but make no mistake the effect is there and it will always be there and there is nothing that you can do to undo that and the reason why most people hate hearing this is because it instantly makes them accountable for every single thing that they have ever done and being held accountable is something that most human beings hate now to be clear I'm not saying that we should all dwell in the past and feel sory for ourselves but what it does mean is that going forward you should be very conscious of the things that you say and the things that you do within this world and if you feel like you behaved in a way or you really lost it on someone you can always apologize to that person because it is never ever too late to say I'm sorry and the second truth Tru of the universe is the law of impermanence which means that every single thing here on Earth is temporary like our bodies Our Minds our relationships even our brains even the video that you are watching right now this video will probably be gone one day because the sun could explode and every single thing could be gone within a second and funny enough this is actually a good thing and it shouldn't really make you feel bad or sad because it's none of those things what it should make you do is really cherish each and every single moment that you have here on Earth and to be clear they don't have to be these big special moments they can be any moment like that one time where you laugh so hard that tears fell from your eyes or maybe it was that time where you simply were sitting alone and you were just gazing at the sunset because all we really have in this lifetime is the present moment and the third truth is the law of suffering and attachment anytime that we become attached to something or someone you are basically making a contract with yourself to be unhappy because like we just discussed nothing here on Earth is permanent which means that you will eventually lose that loved one or you will eventually lose that watch or that car or that family member even your own body you are going to lose and the fourth truth is that we all are going to die one day and the death truth is typically the toughest one for most people to accept because it often makes people really sad but death does not have to be this horribly bad thing or even a sad thing because without death the moments with our friends or our family would not really be that special or deep without death everything would eventually become dull and meek and gray and there would be no incentive to really love and cherish the moment moments that we have with one another there would be no incentive to really laugh deeply or love deeply or even to be present and these are the things that truly make life rich and worth living and on top of that death is one of those things that truly does connect all of us because it makes you realize that you and the Seven other billion people here on Earth really are all on the same team because this is our time this is our time to collectively live live life to the fullest as one so the next time that you feel the need to yell at that loved one or to yell at that person who cut you off in traffic or to get revenge on that person who wronged you in the past just remember that you are choosing to actively hurt your very own teammate make every moment count love deeply laugh deeply and be present to the moment because at the end of the day all we really have in life is the Pres present moment so don't let it go to waste if you want to learn more about life and motivation then go ahead and click the video on the screen right now I promise that you will love it thanks for watching and I'll see you all very soon",0.095,0.779,0.126,0.9924

other people are thinking about you because everyone is only thinking about themselves every second you spend comparing your life to someone else's is a second spent wasting yours don't get emotionally attached to anyone people change even your best friends can turn into strangers one day learn to be content and happy by yourself if you need a company to be happy then it will make you weak share your progress not your goals and you'll always be motivated don't be afraid to be alone being by yourself is far superior than being with crappy people the people who ask the most from you are the people who do the least for you take your responsibilities seriously but not yourself fear is not there to stop you it's there to show you that you're interested and you care don't make permanent decisions on temporary emotions if you put her on a pedestal she has no choice but to look down on you people give you advice based on their perspective not everything in your brain needs to come out of your mouth don't do anything that you will have to lie about later light travels faster than sound that's why some people appear bright until you hear them speak don't look for happiness it's always inside you you owe nothing to your younger self but you owe everything to your present self self-care is realizing that you are your greatest obstacle your parents were correct multiple times even if not academically qualified stop insulting them when they advise you act like you have been there before overthinking ruins you it ruins the situation twists things around makes you worry about futile questions and makes everything much worse than it actually is if you're going to get angry about something think to yourself will I remember this in 10 years you only get one body take care of it you'll have it all your life and while it is incredibly resilient it can only give you what you put in if someone emphasizes that they are telling the truth you can be sure they are lying all you have power and influence over is what you decide to do with the time that you are given today you will never ruin a role if you play yourself don't compare the behind the scenes of your life to someone else's highlight real just because you miss someone doesn't mean you need them back in your life missing is a part of getting over first you choose a partner on the basis of their looks and enjoy Until you realize that your kids will not be raised by their looks but by their values you cannot have everything you always exchange something for for something to know who your true friends are look for the ones who say good things behind your back and bad things to your face letting go is very hard but it's the best thing to do with time the more winds with fear you can accumulate the more Fearless you will become never make someone a priority who only makes you an option if you are a friend of everybody you are an enemy to yourself you were born with two ears and one mouth use them in that proportion the biggest thing you need to accept is change you don't only live once you live multiple lives within one life becomes easier and More Beautiful when we can see the good in other people you can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep spring from coming let others actions speak for them people will show you far more than they will tell you everything that you do you are creating dots you can connect those dots in the later part of life and understand why you did what you did commitment is what gets you started consistency is what gets you somewhere and persistence is what keeps you going you can fall in love more than once you don't need to worry much when someone you love leaves you most of the time it's for the good if someone is trying to bring you down it only means you are above them don't make promises if you have no intention to fulfill them it might not mean anything to you but it could mean a whole world to someone else going back to your ex is like having a shower and putting dirty underwear back on keep an open mind and act like an artist but think fail and learn like a scientist you don't find your purpose somewhere else you create your purpose exactly where you are and you bear meaning to it your entire life can change in an instant so instead of passively taking what you have for granted be grateful for it and do whatever good you can with it you grow Rich when you seek new experiences not material things action breeds more clarity than thought so you can't think your way into a new life you have to act your way into one the life you experience is simply a reflection of your mindset chasing happiness will lead you to misery Until you realize that happiness is the way all you have is the now and what you do with it be smart enough to ask for advice but be wise enough to know who to seek it from if you can drop anything from your world World drop the ego the more grateful you are the more Beauty you will see all around you the more generous life will seem and the happier you will become you won't forget some bad things you just stop caring until that happens don't stress too much about it success is not about your resources it's about how resourceful you are with what you have fear limits most people throughout their lives and permeates through all of their decisions do your best to control it overcome it and revel when you defeat it you cannot swim for New Horizons until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore it's never too late to do the things you've always wanted to do don't let naysayers discourage you because they may be projecting their own insecurities you can't change what happened no matter if it was your fault or someone else messed it up don't be mad about it deal with the challenge people will always project their fears in limiting beliefs onto you what you must do is build a shield against this noise so you can protect yourself from it do not discuss your past with anyone because only you know it's true story and significance others may not understand or even use it against you your tomorrow may be way different from your today if you try keep crying about what is not working today and I promise you that your tomorrow is not working sometimes the world is trying to tell you who you are but if you don't stop to reflect and listen you'll never be able to hear your life won't go as planned and trust me it's a good thing I remember sitting alone thinking I'd hit rock bottom but during that tough time I met people who shared lessons with me that helped me get through it these lessons might be just what you need right now people aren't for you or against you they're for themselves what is coming is better than what is gone sometimes you just have to walk away let people go and let relationships end your true friends become a parent when you're at your lowest the only way out is [Music] through you are stronger than you think you have gotten through every bad day in your life and you are undefeated nobody is going to watch out for you like you once you face your fear nothing is ever as hard as you think out of difficulties grow Miracles believe you can and you're halfway there not everyone whom you meets intentions are true the days that you don't want to do anything are the days that you need to do the most the only thing you can control is how you feel do and think stop trying to change other people because it almost never works hardships often prepare Ordinary People for an extraordinary Destiny the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams sometimes we can only find our true Direction when we let the Wind of Change carry us never sacrifice your growth for anyone pain is inevitable suffering is optional you're braver than you believe stronger than you seem and smarter than you think trust yourself you've survived a lot and you'll survive whatever is coming you never know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice change is not a threat it's an invitation to live we either make ourselves miserable or we make ourselves strong the amount of work is the same keep your expectations only to yourself life is not always Fair people that lie and cheat can often come out on top but no matter how bad a situation may seem you just have to keep battling on hoping and wishing don't make things change making different decisions and working hard does honesty is a very expensive gift don't expect it from cheap people when patience pans out you realize you've not waited for [Music] long got to love yourself before before you can love others when something happens and it causes us pain the pain is there to teach us a lesson it is not so that we feel pain for the sake of [Music] pain good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future there are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life except in your mind we must meet the challenge rather than wish it were not before us Letting Go isn't a one-time thing it's something you have to do every day over and over again difficult roads always lead to beautiful destinations there Comes A Time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page write another book or simply close it when you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently most people will deceive you if you give them at least half a chance you don't drown by Falling In The Water you drown by staying there life is inherently risky there is only one big risk you should avoid at all costs and that is the risk of doing nothing every next level of your life will demand a different hue take the first step in faith you don't have to see the whole staircase just take the first step don't let anyone ever make you feel like you don't deserve what you want the chief danger in life is that you may take too many precautions the most important thing in life is learning how to fall bad days build better days let the improvements of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize others people tend to complicate their own lives as if living weren't already complicated enough a tough lesson in life that one has to learn is that not everybody wishes you well there is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world there is merely the comparison of one state to the other only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate Bliss hard times are sometimes blessings in Disguise we do have to suffer but in the end it makes us strong better and wise rehearsing situations in your head is a waste of time the situation will always be different than anything your imagination will come up with people will walk in and out of your life and those you least expect will become past remembrances of a temporary time you once thought was permanent one of my biggest lessons in life is we heal at the speed of our forgiveness a little foolishness enough to enjoy life and a little wisdom to avoid the errors that will do hard times don't create Heroes it is during the hard times when the hero within us is revealed happiness is not not the absence of problems it's the ability to deal with them the great courageous act that we must all do is to have the courage to step out of our history and past so that we can live our dreams nothing in your life will change unless you change you think you know someone but mostly you just know what you want to know it took a long time but I have learned that you just can't take anything you want out of life without putting something back in exchange instead of worrying about what you cannot control shift your energy to what you can create maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses and start making [Music] changes you can't understand everything immediately sometimes you need to wait some goodbyes set you free the only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be if you have a strong purpose in life you don't have to be pushed your passion will drive you there life changes for the better when we realize that we don't have to know everything and we don't have to pretend that we do be the reason someone Smiles be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people it's never too late to reinvent yourself actions rooted in persistence sometimes bear bitter fruit sometimes you have to let part parts of yourself go or you'll never be happy obstacles don't have to stop you if you run into a wall don't turn around and give up figure out how to climb it go through it or work around it you can't always get what you want but if you try sometimes you get what you need the first step towards getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you are the hardest thing to learn in life is which bridge to cross and which bridge to burn all you have to do is pay attention lessons always arve when you are ready facing your emotions gives you more strength and happiness in the long run than shutting them down or ignoring them if you believe very strongly in something stand up and fight for it guard well your thoughts when alone and your words when accompanied the trouble is if you don't spend your life yourself other people spend it for you be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals if there's a single lesson that life teaches us it's that wishing doesn't make it so sometimes you're not going to fit in no matter how hard you try and it's better to just be [Music] alone every Journey has its final day don't rush when one door closes another opens but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us always trust what your gut tells you even when everybody else tries to convince you otherwise don't take people for granted you never know when they could be gone you never know how much they they mean to you until they're gone never back down from a real challenge they give the best lessons in life you are the only person that can simultaneously be your best friend and your worst enemy and you can choose which one is more prevalent you cannot control the behavior of others but you can always choose how you respond to it don't cry because it's over smile because it happened sometimes you have to lose all you have to find out who you truly are people only get better with experience if they are willing to learn and understand the lessons that are given to them through the bad times in their lives tough times teach us that our resilience is stronger than we ever imagined you have to speak up for yourself no one else will you won't always be able to help someone change for the better if you keep trying there will come a day when you decide you can't do it anymore and they clearly don't want to change your life is the result of the choices you make there is no plan just the consequences of choices be cautious with good deeds kindness has limits and some may exploit your generosity you can either become the victim of your struggles or emerge from them as the hero of your life the most precious thing in the world is time with those you love we tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have but rather of recognizing and appreciating what we do have your future is your past which you understand you have to help yourself no one else can help you you have to do it yourself once you realize this you will feel more in control of your life,0.108,0.705,0.187,0.9999

Like, so if i were old, I could buy stuff for my own, and be married, but- That would be ew. Do you wish you were young? Why? Well, uh, the problem about, uh the great thing about being young is You have more time You have more time to do things. I could play games- Which I did, I used to play Cowboys and Indians. Yeah, that's what I play! Do you? Yeah! That's what I like about being young. I could use my imagination more. That's sad story, you can't do that anymore. Well... I could be an older cowboy. I might do it, yes. Will you fall in love? And what will it be like? I don't know. Like, we'll have babies and it will be like fun...oh I'd have to change Even though I'll have to change his diaper. It'll be fun! Oh. But what if he cries? Ahh well. I'll just sing like Ed Sheeran to him And, who do you love now? Um... My mom. Your mom? Your dad? I like my dad I like my family. Did you fall in love? What was it like? Yes, uh- It was different for me. I fell in love, late. And did you get married? No, unfortunately, my partner, she passed away she died. That was a sad thing. Yeah. She got sick. I'm gonna cry. No, no don't. No, no, no. No. No ah no no. You see, these things happen, Shawn. That's life. But, We, we have I have very good memories Very good memories. And you life, a lot of the time you live in your head with those memories. You can remember all the good things, and that's the important thing. Well, the advice I would give to you Shawn, uh Is You don't have to be rich to be happy Do the things you like to, and that make you feel good. Because when you're happy yourself, everybody else is happy. Shawn do you have any advice for Gordez? To like, act normal. Don't be silly Don't bully lots of people. The people I know in school like my friend Alex in school Whenever he gets hurt I hug him. It might not be able to work but. No, that's good advice, uh And, be yourself don't let other people tell you what you should be. Just be as you are, isn't that true? Yeah. And, I'm sure your life is going to be very successful You have all the right things. You have all the right things to do. All your good friends. And uh, keep those friends going. And keep life going oh! There you go.",0.105,0.621,0.274,0.9993
Vp-TVkqaCrQ,2630863,219434,3400,The mindset that changed my life IMMEDIATELY,20240217,there's really just one single wall between you and the life you know you want to live and that's your mindset and I'm going to share one with you that kind of changed my life immediately trust me I know how you feel I know you're sick of it you're sick of knowing that you have these big goals and dreams and yet you don't know how you're going to reach them and it kind of feels like you're just wasting all your potential so ultimately you do nothing because the more you think about it all the more overwhelming and honestly impossible it all sounds but what if I told you that it really wasn't that hard and in reality you can change your life as soon as tomorrow in late December of 2023 I decided I'm done I can't do this anymore I can't sit here and continue to feel miserable and empty while I wait for my life to change for me but then I fell into the same old trap as I'm sure you have I start to overthink and I started to get overwhelmed I would think about how long it would take and just how much work I would actually have to put in to make a difference in my life and then I reached my phone to open Instagram for like the 30th time today but then it dawned on me I recall a piece of advice I was given a while back by who uh I have no idea it was probably my mom though thanks Mom but the advice goes just take one step every day when you think of your goal or a dream don't look at the entire Mountain you're about to climb just find where you're going to put your foot next it doesn't need to be complicated it's easy to get overwhelmed by your big goals and dreams but if you just think just one step today and I'm done it makes things a whole lot easier and if you still need a little bit of extra motivation just remember that the pain of doing nothing will always be worse than the pain of doing something cuz sure taking steps can be uncomfortable and intimidating and scary but it will will always be better than the alternative the slow NeverEnding subconscious discomfort of remaining dormant will always be worse than the temporary and voluntary discomfort of making a change maybe some days you'll feel an extra bit of motivation and you decide to take three steps instead of just one that's great and maybe some days you're really just not feeling it but you just remind yourself just a small step today that's fine too what matters is that you moved forward even if it was just a little bit these steps add up and before you know it you'll be able to see the top of that mountain just a little bit clearer than before and when I say that this changed my life immediately I mean it because while before I wasn't moving forward now I am one step at a time one day at a time currently while I'm writing this it is February 13th and I find that I've been working on something every day since the new year as I just keep reminding myself just take one step today and as a result I have instantly changed my life maybe not in a substantial way like I didn't just become instantly successful or anything but now I've given myself some sort of Purpose with each day and I'm slowly but surely moving forward you must change your life in order to change your life make that small change do it once every day and eventually you'll realize that you've made a bigger change than you could have ever [Music] imagined,0.079,0.815,0.106,0.9097

please sing along with the family. Wait a minute. Kyler? Wait a minute. Pull over. Kyler! Kaden! Let's think about this, Max. We saw Kyler walking home alone,
with his toys. That means if we can get inside, we can steal the toys and steal
Christmas at the same time. Oh, you like that idea? Perfect. Let's do that then. Wait, Jack, slow down. I think we lost them. Aw, man. Kyler really went all out. Step back, you beast. What are you gonna do with that, silly? Watching Kyler eat is making me tired. Get out of there. They saw us! They saw us! Kaden warned me about this. Kyler what, huh? No way. Kyler! Kade? What are you doing here? I thought I was home alone. I knew this would happen, so I had to follow after you
and make sure you were safe. What do we do? Quick! Turn on all the lights. Wait, what? How come the lights
are turning on so fast? Oh, great, Max. Kyler must not be the only one home. Oh, well, Max, it was worth a shot. Maybe we'll come back next year. All right,
I'm pretty sure that scared them off. But,
I have one more thing just to be sure. Hey, street face,
we know you're out there. You better stay away from us or else. Don't worry about it. We're already leaving. Wait a minute. Max. Was that Kade? Oh, Max. I've been waiting for almost
four years to get back at him, after what he did to me. Oh, geez. What the- Now I have to come back
to seek my revenge. I'll come back early in the
morning when they least expect it. You guys, why didn't you tell us that Kaden and
Kyler were not back there this whole time? I don't know. I guess we were just
on our phones too much. Wait, phones? Kade should have his phone. We can call him and make
sure that they're okay. All right, this is crazy. Okay, dialing him right now. Uh guys? Bad news. His phone's right here. No! Okay, just because he ran off doesn't
mean he won't come back. If I learned one thing about the Grinch,
it's that he never gives up. So what do you say we
get a good night's rest. So tomorrow morning, we plan. Santa, I don't know if you can hear me,
but tomorrow we might need, some of your Christmas magic. I miss you, Mom. Okay, seriously,
you gotta turn around right now. We've gotta go back. Wait, but we've been driving
for like five hours. Yeah, and I'm so tired. Can't we stop and sleep somewhere? You guys, we can't just leave Kyler and Kade in
there for the whole Christmas break. Oh, no. Oh, geez. Oh, great. Of course there's traffic right now. Oh no, the GPS says eight hours. You're right. Oh, it's early in the morning. I'll bet you they're still
counting sugar plums in their head. Kyler, do you see anything? No, not yet. Wait, yes. He's right over there. I have a feeling this is going to be
the last time the Grinch messes with us. Rats. It's locked. I'm going to have to sneak around back. Oh my gosh, there's a turtle. I'm going to ride this thing. Giddy up, giddy up. Yee ha! Wait, Kade. He's riding the turtle. What does that mean? He's unpredictable. All right, I gotta get back to work! See you later. Quick, get your spot! Back door. I hope it's unlocked. Ooh, it's so quiet in here. It's almost like they
don't know I'm coming. First, I just gotta find out where Kyler
got all those brand new toys, and then I can start stealing Christmas. Kade, he's almost here. Let's get him. Let's go. Say good morning. Good morning? Oh my gosh! Take this. What are you doing to me? Whose idea was this? Kyler, get the big one. Wait, what? The big one? What do you mean the big one? Got him. Why, I oughta- That's all of them. Let's go! Where'd they go? Phase two. Phase two, remember the plan! Maybe they came up here. My goodness. I gotta be careful. When I was their age, I never got up before like
one or two in the afternoon. I'm just gonna have to be extra, extra,
extra careful. Hey, boys. I know you're in here somewhere. The Christmas tree. Wait. How am I gonna get it
home to Mount Crumpet? Hey, Grinchy poo. What Kyler? What are you doing up there? Say good night! You missed. No, I didn't. Wait, what? Geez, Kyler. What are you doing to me? Besides, it was a pillow. It didn't hurt very bad. Oh, I'm sorry. Kade, now! Kade now? What does that mean? Get it on me. Get it out of me. Let's get this party started. That was a close one. Spider! Quick, hand me that. I'm going to lead him to the bathroom. He'll never see this coming. Closer, closer, closer! Go away, leave! Go ready go! Go, leave! Right on target. Don't get me. Don't get me. Don't get me. Don't get me! I'm gonna. Oh, my, Kade! Kyler! Oh, my gosh. He's soaking wet. And freezing. Oh, here he comes. Kaden, Kyler. Woah, that worked better than I expected. Yeah, let's get him. Hey, Grinch. Looking a little cold there. His belly's as hard as ice. Stay away from me. What was that? I, can't hear you. Speak up, Grinch. It's not nice to mumble. I'm not. I'm not mumbling. I'm freezing. You were. You're what? I'm freezing. Oh, Kyler, I have an idea. I wonder if the Grinch has a cell phone. Let's check. I found it! Wait, what are you doing? That's my cell phone. Wait, who's this. At the top of your contacts? No, no, don't read that. Don't read that. Martha May, crush? Maybe we should text her. No way. Don't do that. Don't do that. Text her. Don't text Martha. The last thing she said was, ""Ew,
your breath smells like onions""! Well, yeah, of course it does. What else would it smell like? Let's just not text her. Let's send her a picture. A picture? A picture of what? I have a perfect idea for a picture. Wait, no, that's a terrible angle. That's no good. That's the point, buddy. My belly is as big as my love for you. Heart, heart, heart. And. Don't send it. Don't send it. Send! You guys are gonna pay for this. Oh, no. We better go. Hey, where are you guys. Up here. I know you guys can't get here. Where are you Kade? Oh my gosh. How are you guys doing this so fast? Kyler, where'd you go? Oh my gosh. I'm gonna get you, Kade. Oh my gosh. I'm getting too old for this. I can't believe they're
getting away from me like this. Stand by, Kyler. He's almost there. Ready when you are. I can't keep going. I need to rest. Oh, look. Look at this arm rest chair

I have all the snowballs. What do we do? I thought you would know. Santa, if you can hear me,
please use your magic right now. What? Santa? Kyler, Kade, what did you call me for? Santa?! Yes, Kyler. What do you need? I heard you calling for
me on my magic snow globe. Right over there. Get behind me, children. This one's serious. Good call, Kyler. Santa Claus. We meet again. My arch nemesis. What brings you to these parts, Grinch? How many times do I
have to explain myself, Santa? Well, just one more time. What? Seriously? You don't know? I'm stealing Christmas, dude. What?! No, I know what you need. A big teddy bear hug. A teddy bear? A teddy bear hug. I hate teddy bears. What? You're serious? It's a teddy bear. This is ridiculous. Watch and learn. The Grinch is famously
afraid of Teddy bears. Hello, Grinch. Do you want a big hug? Okay, I'm leaving. I love you. Come back. Holy cow. It actually worked. Wow Santa. Thanks! Santa? Where'd he go? I missed you mom! I missed you too, buddy. You guys were home alone,
I cannot believe this! I promise we'll never

and this one's a very cool Nerf place. And you can get awesome stuff at Best Buy. Michael's, iHop, Laser tag. If you land on any of the Hawaii islands
or the airplane or the hula girl, the whole family gets to go to Hawaii. I'm really hoping to get Hawaii. And because it's super cool and you get to
spend time with your family there. If you land on this,
then you get a cool mystery box. If you land on this,
then you get to go to an awesome movie. You don't want to land here because
you get no electronics for one day. And if you land here,
you have to do the dishes, which is pretty hard in our family. I got to go first. I'm not sure what to do. I wanna go to Best Buy,
and I wanna get the money thing. Oh, no. And they're all in. They're both in a different corner,
so I don't know. I'm gonna try to go for money. Okay. Three, two, one. Ooh ooh. Just barely! Look at it! I just barely got the Air. Like,
literally, it's just barely even on the line. See you. I'm gonna go jump. I'm so excited to go into the jump park. Follow me, guys. You guys, there's a zip line. Here I go. Follow me here guys. That was so much fun. Now it's my turn,
and I'm going for Best Buy. But first I've got to get perfect aim. Okay. Ooh. I just threw it and it hit the wall. It's my turn. My Mom says because I'm four,
I get to do that one. I'm so excited. Oh, my gosh. I got nothing. I just landed on the wall. Now it's my turn. I think I'm gonna throw it in the
middle so I have the best chance of winning something. Legos! Yes, yes, yes! I'm going to the Lego store. Oh, maybe I can get Minecraft Legos. Minecraft's my favorite. I'm out of here. See you at the Lego store. Well,
here I am at this awesome Lego store. Now let's go see where I can go and buy. Hey, this is the one I have decided. This roller coaster can
transform into this one. This one or this one. Now let's go buy it. I'm scared, you guys. Three, two, one. Oh. Darn it. Dang it. I got nothing. Now I'm real scared. Three, two, one. Again?! Dang it. Now I've lost two turns. I wanna land on ice cream. I'm ready. Ice cream, here I come. Redo it. That was funny. I got this. But I get to redo again, right? I keep on missing. I gotta go one more time. Should I do this? I got it! Ice cream, here I come. I'm gonna get bubblegum ice cream. And there's gum in it. Yummy, yummy, yummy. I'm so excited what I
got from the Lego store. Now my strategy is instead
of going in the middle. I think I'm gonna go to the side,
get money. McDonald's or Michaels
or present or Hawaii. I just really hope I don't get dishes. Second try. Here I go. Present! Yes. Yes. These are all the presents my Mom wrapped. I'm gonna pick one of them and
open them and see what I get. Okay,
I'm gonna see if there's any like this. That's hard to tell. Okay, I'm going for this one. Oh,
by the way, Netflix brought us this cool game called Carmen San Diego. Ooh, a Netflix card. I'm keeping this. Oh, and a book. A book. Alright, that and it goes with the game. I'll play with this with my sister later. Where in the world is Carmen San Diego? Oh, I'm scared. Okay, three, two. Third times a charm and this time
I'm aiming for popcorn and a movie. Yes! Yes, yes, yes. I got it. Yes! I got what I wanted. I got a movie ticket. Woo hoo! I might see the new How To
Train Your Dragon Three. Or the Lego movie two again. I missed twice,
but at least I got something. And a movie's pretty cool,
so I'm pretty stoked. I wanna go. I actually wanna go on. If I land on Hawaii,
the whole family can go. I get to go to a movie. Hooray! Hey, Kalia, what are you screaming about? Yeah, what are you screaming about? You win the movie? You win the movie? You win the movie? Kalia and I both got to go to the movies! Woo hoo! Kaden gets to come with me. Do you wanna see How To Train

for my sister at Claire's. Should I call her out here and tell her? Jasmine! Come here. Come here. Yeah? Since you only got one thing. I got Claire's for you,
so then you can buy something at Claire's. Thank you, Jack. Give me a hug. Celebrate. Let's do this. Guys, I'm so excited to go in Claire's. Jack was so nice to let me have Claire's. Let me see what I can find. Payton just arrived. So you're gonna help me. I kind of feel like I
want this BFF necklace. I think we're gonna get this one to share. There I go. Now it's time for the bonus round. My Mom said we can each go one more time. Oh, this is so stressful. Yeah, I'm gonna try to aim again. Darn it. What I'm gonna go for is Best Buy,
Michaels? or Target? Or instead of Target, maybe Hawaii. Yes! Best buy! Yeah, I got best Buy! Yes! I got Best Buy! That's the top number
one thing that I wanted. I am so lucky. I'm so excited I landed on Best Buy. Let's go inside and see what I get. This is so cool. It's a fire seven and it

with just the little kids. Just Kyler and Kalia and Mommy and Daddy. What do you think? What? No. No. Family. Family. Family. Family. Kyler, Me, and Daddy and Mommy. Oh, these guys have gone to
Disneyland so many times. It's been fun. But it would be fun to go
with just the little kids. So should we do it? Yeah! All right, we're gonna do it and we'll show you
the video right at the very end of this. Let's move on to Kaden. Here we go! Gonna get that Apple store. Let's see it. You lost a turn. I want to go for the Apple store,
but also I'm gonna go for the money. Oh. Here's the money right here. Can I have the $100? Oh, just broke the money. Don't blow on it. It's just windy. Oh, it's half on the map. No, it's more. Look, it's more into the money. Let's decide this the fair way. What costs me the least amount of money? No! No. No. No. Jazzy,
if you go to the right balloon store, you could get,
like. I think,
honestly, that really is as much
of a tie as you can. You can get. So can I choose either? I think it's closer to the balloon. So you get to choose on this one. Money. Money! Money for everybody. It's just my money. $100. Hundred bucks. Aim for Hawaii. Aim for the dishes! Oh, you got nerf. No, it's in the. Oh, it's nerf. Oh, it's nerf. Fun Squad, look how close I was to the Apple
store that would have been so cool. I got nerf. It's still pretty cool. Which one do I want? Oh. Should I get this one or
should I get this one? It can go as fast as 110 FPS. Whatever that means. Whoa. Sweet. Hopefully I hit something good this time. Here we go. I'm feeling it,
I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it. And No! Kyler's turn. Kyler. All right, throw it hard. Hit it. You go this Kyler, do it Kyler. Since these guys want that one. Do you want to wait and see what
they get and you can trade with them? Trade. Want to trade? Okay, we're going to wait and
see what other people get. And then you can trade with
whatever else you want, okay? Okay. All right, Kalia's turn. Here we go. Okay. Three, two, one, go! Oh, toy store! Woo! You're gonna go to the toy store. That sounds fun. Gimme, five. Whoo! We're at the toy store. Let's go! Oh, I want this Roxy. Rocks. Fun Squad, I wanna get this. I think I should get this. There you are. All right. Kaden's turn. Here we go. I'm aiming for the Apple Store. Oh! Oh wait. That's fine. It's on the line. It's supposed to be on Nerf. It's. It's half. No, no, no. It's half. It's half. Kaden, you got nerf! Okay, let's go! These guys grew up on Nerf,
and now they want the apple store. All right, let's go. What's up, Fun Squad? We're here at Target to
get nerf just like Jack. And so let's go right inside. Guys, so I just got here at the nerf section
and I am looking to buy a nerf blaster. Kaden,
you should get this one because I got it. And then we can have a giant nerf battle. It would be so fun. Yeah. All right. I'm gonna get this. I'm so excited. Let's have a nerf down. Come on. Okay. All right. It is Jazzy's turn. Should I do a chick fil a
or should I do a present? Your present. Nobody's got a present yet. Hawaii! Hawaii! Hawaii! Let's do present. Okay, here we go. Three, two. Yeah, white! Okay, go again. All right. Here we go. You can do it. Three, two, one. Money! Again? Money again? Yeah! Dang it. I'm out of money. I guess you get. Another hundred dollars. I guess we have to do that. All right. It is Jack's turn. Let's see it, Jack. What are you aiming for? Really, Jack? Okay, how about this? Since Jack already got nerfed,
we're gonna let him go again, okay? And if I get nerf again,
then I just gonna keep going. If he gets nerf again, he's just destined to be a
nerf sponsor or something. Let's do this, Jack. Oh! Ice cream! It wasn't ice cream! No one saw that. It was ice cream! No, it was there. No, it wasn't. Yes, it was. It was on ice cream. What about this Jack, you can get ice crem and bring
it to your crush's house. I only will eat the cone. Jack actually doesn't like
sweets or ice cream very much. I don't either. So you don't like it? No. So let's go. All right. Let's go. All right,
Fun Squad, we are back at the ice cream store. And I'm gonna get ice cream. I'll do the. Yeah. Looks pretty yummy so I'm gonna try it. Tastes pretty good. All right, let's go head back. All right, it is my turn. I'm gonna try. I've already messed up twice. I've hit the wall. My goal is to at least hit
anything at this point. Hey kids, kids, kids. Come here, come here, come here. Let's make a deal. Yeah! Yeah. Okay. Okay. You can go right here
if you aim for Hawaii. Yeah. For the whole family. That's a good idea. Deal? That's a good deal. Deal. All right, deal. Deal. Deal. Deal. Deal. All right, here we go. Hawaii, here we come. Three, two, one. Oh. Almost. You got to go again. Actually, I got to go one more time because
it landed on the whiteboard. I was close, you guys. I was like, out in the ocean. Probably hit a boat or something. Here we go. Ready? All right,
Kyler, this is the final decision to see
if you want to trade your $150 apple gift card to Jazzy. $100. Oh, is that a trade? Yes? You got to trade? Yes! Apple Store! Okay. All right. Okay,
guys, I already have an iPod and
I already have AirPods. So I'm thinking what I should
get is a birthday gift for Jack. Because our birthday is coming up soon,
so I'm gonna get AirPods for Jack. Come on, let's go. All right, Fun Squad. What did, what did Kalia win? Disneyland. She got Disneyland. So we're gonna go
Disneyland with these guys, right? Yeah. All right, let's do it. Woh! All right, we made it to Disneyland. It's Mickey. Yay! Say hi, Eeyore. This is Kyler! You guys excited? Take a picture. Thank you so much for

C7-uk_X99bs,8511163,8479,1200,We Opened A Real Subway and 7- Eleven In Our House!,20240615,"What's up, Fun Squad? Today we are going to be building
real life restaurants in this house. It's gonna be boys! Boys! Versus girls. Yeah! We're doing 711 and Subway. But which one should the girls do? Let's settle this with rock paper,
scissors. Rock, paper, scissors. Best out of one. It's decided then. Time to suit up! Time to suit up! All right,
so first thing, we like to advertise our things,
which means we got posters. Put posters everywhere. Oh,
guys, I forgot to tell you,
in 1 hour, there's a five star chef
that's gonna come and judge us. We gotta hurry up! All right,
guys, because I'm the manager of this place,
I'll be putting on the black apron. You're not the manager. I'm the manager. You're not the boss of us. Well, we need some clear leadership. And if you think otherwise, you can always quit. We might lose this challenge because we
do not have the best teamwork right now. Okay,
Fun Squad, I'm a little bit nervous about
this five star restaurant chef coming to see a 711. Because I don't know
how often that happens. I also don't know how often
they come to Subways either, so I think it's gonna be fine. It'll be fine. Guys,
why are our posters sideways and, like,
crooked? Liam, fix it now! Yeah, Liam. You're fired if you don't get this done! I'm sorry, sir! You realize we've spent, like, what. Ten minutes setting up signs and we still
need to go to the store and get our food. Oh, shoot. Oh! That's a lot of damage. I wonder how the girls are
doing with their signs. Oh, my god! We're struggling a little bit over here. No, we're not. We're taping the thing. We're doing fine. Jazzy, what do you think if I put
the Big Gulp over here? You saw nothing. Would you like anything to drink, ma'am? Yeah, can I have a doctor pepper? Yes. Get back to work. No practicing. We have a time crunch. Back to work. I wonder what the girls are doing. Wanna go up and check them? Yes, friend. Let's go. What should we do? Hey. Hey! What are we doing here? Out. Away from here. Oh, my gosh it was Kade and Ethan. Okay,
well, next time they come,
they're done for. But their place is looking kind of spiffy. Not gonna lie. Yeah. They only have one sign set
up and half of the tape. Really? Yeah. They tried to get information, but. Their green bow ties
kind of pick them out, so. We can see exactly what they were doing. We have something that they don't. Friendship. Ow. They don't know. We work up every day. We show up to work, and we work! We work harder,
we work faster, we work stronger,
we work! Guys,
I'm working with a bunch of amateurs. Maybe it's like the famous,
like, world renowned chef named Gordon Ramsay. He has restaurants all around the world. You speak of this Gordon
Ramsay like he's a God. He sounds like this. This is wrong! This isn't cooked right! Hey, Siri, images of Gordon Ramsay. Oh, this is what he looks like. Yeah, yeah, show the camera. I saw that guy. I saw that guy on SpongeBob, Kade. Guys,
we only have 50 minutes left, and we still have to get our
supplies before the chef gets here. Guys, we're running out of time, so. If we want to get this done on time, we need to go run to the
store to get our food. We need to get our game plan together. If we're gonna win this and
we need to go to this store, okay? Yeah! Okay. I believe that we will win. I believe that we will win. I believe that we will win! All right,
we are here at the grocery store. And we need to get,
like, hot dogs,
some nachos, chips,
a bunch of junk food items, but also healthy,
like, yogurt items. Anything you'd see at a 711. Go get. Let's go. Come on, guys. Five tomatoes. We need cucumbers and pickles. I'm not used to buying vegetables. Dude, you can't say the word. Hold this. Shredded iceberg. That's what Subway uses. Ooh. Sriracha sauce. That should be around here too. Right here? Sriracha? Oh, that's supposed to be
supposed to be chipotle. Chipotle sauce. Three types of candy bars,
and three types of fruit candy. This might have been
harder than we thought. Because at Subway,
you only have to get sandwiches. But in the gas station, there's a variety of a
bunch of different things. You also have to find the exact kind
of hot dog meat you're looking at. Let's get these. What are the chances they
actually have the Subway sauce? Wait. Oh, wait. They're Subway sauces. We just get one of each of these. Mustard. I think I found the mayo. And it's real. This should be good. All right, let's get some lunch meats. What's something we can do to
make our 711 more unique than all the other 711s out there? Every customer. We should give them flowers. That's what is gonna make us unique. Wait,
wait, what if we get orange,
green, and red? We only have, like, three things left on our list. We need three types of sliced cheese. Provolone and cheddar. So we'll get sprite. Orange soda. I don't know who the final judges are,
but one might be my Mom. So I'm gonna get some diet coke. That's her favorite drink. And I want a score some points. Okay, would you pick 7-11 or Subway? Probably 7-11. Okay, you get a sticker. Thank you. Thank you. All right,
guys, that's everything on the list. Let's go. We only have,
like, 20 minutes before the
five star chef comes. Did we get ice for those
slurpees and big gulps? No. That's the main thing. Oh, my God. Okay, we have to go back. Go, go. I'll go, I'll go. All right, I got the ice. All right, guys, we got our stuff. We got to hurry and set this up. We got to beat the judge,
and we have to be better than the boys. Yeah. Yeah. Time to set-up. All right,
guys, we're gonna put all the drinks over here. We need to take the drinks
out and lay them out. Yeah. No, that's what I was thinking. Right now,
I'm setting up these so we can have, like,
the meat, the sauce,
and, like,
the cheese. We got the sauce,
and we're gonna start pouring the sauce. So Chipotle. Creamy Italian. Okay,
so we need to add all our drinks up here. All the drinks start over here. Oh, whoa. Why are you actually so genius? I'll put all the candy over here. I don't know. Let's put it all in. We decided that we're not gonna
put the Subway sauces in trays. Maybe if Kade didn't do
that in the first place. Yeah, we did a little research and found
out that we keep them in the bottle, not in the tray. Kade. We did it! Yeah. Woo! That wasn't that bad, right? Liam should be our manager, bro. Yeah, Liam's a manager now. He got the promotion
because of Kade's flaws. We thought,
we're trying to give them, like,
a variety. So it's like two and
then two different kinds. It's like, I'll stack them to each other. We want it to be aesthetically
pleasing for the judge. Looks nice and presentable. Kaden did pickles, and there's pickle juice
all over right here. Yeah, bro. Kaden's made the most
messes out of everyone. Hey, you know what they say. You can't create a
business without messes. Wait,
what is the five star judge grading us on? They're grading us on
presentation and service. Wait, does that mean that they're
not gonna eat the food? Who's gonna eat this
food we're setting up? I don't know. I guess it's a mystery judge then. Guys, I'm getting a call. From who? Hello? Hello,
is this Jack Skye, the manager of the Subway? Who's this? Do you really think the five star
chef is your only judge today? What? We have a second judge? Who? The five star chef is only
judging on appearance and service. We have two mystery judges coming
in to taste your food to see if you really got the Subway taste. Wait, who is this? Goodbye. We need to make sure our food tastes good. But it has to taste like Subway. I did it. Hey,
guys, I think we need to put the
drinks in this mini fridge. Come on. We need to get the avocado. I'm organizing these so that they're
all facing forward so that they look more presentable. Just trying to make things more pleasing
to the eye so the judge will like it more. I'm organizing all the drinks so
it's presentable for the judge. Root beer,
Mountain View, Fanta,
Doctor Pepper, and Coca Cola. Zero sugar. And then we have our big gulp. Alright,
guys, the five star chef is gonna
be here in five minutes. We need someone to go upstairs
and unplug the hot dog warmer. Look around. Pretend you're wandering around. Yeah, act like you're just looking. Say you're trying to, like. Okay,
we got to say we're, like,
having a peace. I volunteer. No, you're not volunteering. You are. Oh, me? You're the most peaceful guy. Yeah, they know that these two
would probably mess around, around and,
like, ruin their stuff. Okay. They will not expect you to do it. Okay? So just go on their back? It's your mission. Just go unplug it. Act like you were grabbing a
snack and then go walk by and. No, that's not gonna work. Do what Liam would do. Shush. I got this. Have we not started the hot dog stand? We need to get those cooking. I'm on it. Comment down below if you guys
think Subway or 7-11's gonna win. But you should definitely comment 7-11. Because we're gonna win. It's already getting hot. Okay, hot dog station is all set. Looks pretty neat. Hey. Hey, guys. So I just came here to just look at
you guys food and just mind I ask the things you guys made. What's that over there? Those are our hot dogs. Those are our hot dogs. Those are your hot dogs. That's pretty cool. What's that over there? Oh, that's way cool. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. How does it work? We're gonna let it melt. That's really cool. Why are you acting so suspicious? Huh? You're acting very suspicious here. No, I just wanted to check everything
out to just see our competition, you know? Okay. Yeah, goodbye. Yeah, you guys are doing great. Goodbye. Bye. Okay,
guys, I unplugged the hot dog,
like, warmer without them even looking. So mission accomplished. I think they haven't even noticed yet. Their hot dogs are gonna
be caught cold anyways. Guys, I did it. I sabotaged them. This is W's, we're gonna win! Okay,
guys, I think we're gonna be,
like, really good in,
like, the service area. Because all this are super nice and stuff,
but we don't ever know, like,
the boys presentation could be, like,
super good. So we need someone to,
like, go maybe spy down there. I'll go. Okay. Me too. Okay, me three, let's go. I smell stuff. It smells like burnt guacamole. It looks so good. What? Their presentation is so good. Guys, they're sabotaging. Their presentation is so good. Yeah, we need ours to be way better. They got visors. It's so good. We need some lighting to help. That's much better. I still don't think this
will be at the boys. Everybody check all the food. The five star chef is gonna
be here any second now. Guys,
the hot dogs are, like,
freezing cold. This isn't good. Oh no! Cristy, did you do that? No,
why would I unplug the hot dog machine? Wait, it was Liam he sabotaged when he was up here. That makes so much sense. Now that's why he was
acting so suspicious. We have to get them back guys. We have to sabotage their Subway. No, we don't have time. Well, I don't think we have a choice. We have to do this. Yeah, we should get them back. We have to. Okay, let's think. What's the most important
part of a Subway sandwich? Oh, the bread! Yeah. If we squish some of their bread,
the judge will see it, and they'll definitely
give him a bad grade. All right, let's do it. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's go. Hey, boys. Boys! Oh, hey, guys. What's up? Hey, the judge is here. She's upstairs. Come on. Upstairs. Come on, let's go. Come on. Let's go, Jazz. Wait, where'd everybody else go? Yeah, wait, where did they go? Let's go! Okay. Where's Gordon Ramsay? Where is he? Over here. Go! Stomp on it. Jump. No need to squish it. It was already squishy. Wait, guys, where's the judge? Yeah, well. Where's the judge? Wait,
I'm gonna see and peek through the door. Oh, my gosh. We got them. Oh, shh! We did nothing. How about you dare? Open the door. Wait. Wait. No one's here. Wait, guys, where's the judge? Yeah. Where's the judge? We thought she was here. We heard her. We heard through the door,
we thought she was here. They sabotaged us! No. No. No. No. It was a trick all along. Why would we do that? I was wondering where
Annalise and Maliyah went. Guys, wait. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Guys,
the judge is gonna be here in, like,
30 seconds. We need to go! Oh, go, go, go! I heard there's two prestigious
restaurants going up in this area. I'm here to find out, but here they're run by kids and
it's not gonna work for me. I am not here to mess around. I'm gonna be giving honest,
critical feedback. Let's go. Oh, my gosh, guys. She's here. Oh, my gosh. All chefs to the line. Who's in charge? Me! Okay. Me! Come right here. All right. What do we have? Seven Eleven! Okay, what are we offering? Hot dogs, nachos, chips, anything. Slurpees, everything that you would
want at Seven Eleven. What's our first course? Look at this exquisite
divine french cheese. Yeah. Okay, I see a little crustiness there. Yeah. That's. It's there a little while. You know, you can't just cover it up by smearing
it because people are gonna taste it. What do we need to do? Not burn the cheese. Burn the cheese. Not burn the cheese. Yeah. Unless it's for a purpose. Everything needs to have a purpose. And we have gloves? Let me see. Okay,
the only other thing is, hairs gotta be pulled out back as
soon as you go into the kitchen. Always back. Don't use your gloves because
that's what you're using for food. Right? Just to let you know,
when I was cooking, my hair was pulled back,
you know? Okay. Guys, we need to find out what
they did to our thing. Maybe check the signs. Did they, like, empty the sauces? No. It's gonna come back to bite us if
we don't figure out what they did. Alright, so this is your first course. Where's our second course? Muffins. Muffins. Muffins. This is an appetizer. Yeah. Explain. Salt. Sweets. Drinks. Third course. What do we got? Hot dogs. Hot dogs. Hot dogs. Bring me to it. So we've got the hot dogs cooking in here. We take the bun,
we put it on the plate, then we transfer the
hot dog onto the bread. And then whatever toppings you would like,
we put on it. Well, the flow is very backwards. What other toppings do we have? Mustard and ketchup. Well, demonstrate one for me. Let's go. Oh, okay, we got the bread, right? Okay. Open it a little bit. Too much mustard. Do one little line of mustard, okay? Okay. Now, what's the temperature on these? Because you don't want
anybody to get sick, right? Yeah. It's at 250. Well, that means they dead. There you go. Okay. That looks like I got something
from a baseball field. Uh oh. You want to taste test your own product? All right, let's see what you got. If you can't even eat your own food,
how are you gonna serve it to your guests? All right, what's for dessert? What's for dessert? What's next? I don't think the hot dog's very ready. All right, let's see what you got. It's good. Is it tart? A little bit,
but I think it's really good. What would balance the tartness? More ice and more sweetness. Well, you know your stuff. You answered great. Got to get it done. All right,
overall score on your establishment. We always look at service,
we always look at presentation. And then we actually taste of everything,
right? Aesthetically, you've got your stations set
up where they need to be. Your signage brand is right there. That's exactly what you want to do. Things are organized. Things are in place. So I would have to say eight and a half. Eight and a half. Okay. For presentation. Okay? Okay. All right. So service. Here you go. Here's another one. Wow. Thank you for your service. Bravo on that. I would have to say your
service was actually fantastic. So I would say your
service is about a nine. Keep up with the service. You did great. All right, so flavor here with things. I think the cheese could
do a little better. It was a little too crispy,
a little too hard. You got to add more flavoring
to the slushie there and ice. Hot dog station. Good job. So I got to give you,
like, a seven and a half on that. All right. All right, I'm out of here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. To be honest,
I don't think I could stomach the food. The cheese was looking really rough. The hot dogs, work in progress. Work in progress. I'm out. Hey, Fun Squad forgot to mention
whoever loses has to go to the other team's restaurant. And admit that their restaurant is better. Oh, no. Stay tuned to the end to see who that is. Oh, my goodness. That was a lot more like,
got to the point really fast. She went through every single thing,
which is to our advantage. Because the boys, everything is just. Thrown out there,
and they're gonna get a tight score. Fingers crossed. Depending on what we saw. I hope this restaurants a lot
better than that Seven-Eleven. All right, everybody in front. Okay, who's in charge? He is. He is. I am. All right,
so explain what we got going on. Okay. So this is the best Subway in town. We have,
like, cookies,
we have sandwiches, we have chips. We have sodas. All right, demonstrate. All right, I'm on meat. Oh, he is the cashier. He is the manager. Are you the boss? Oh. Okay, so I'm hearing the boss, right? Yeah, yeah. It's all right. All right, show us what you got. Meat station we have where I'm gonna
do the veggies and some of the sauces. What's with your glove? Oh, it's a little bit big. So anyway, he's gonna be stationed. I'm like the last in dressing station. So then he's gonna be the one
wrapping up the sandwiches. And then he's gonna be the one bringing
out your total and giving you chips, drinks,
you know? Okay,
are these prep stations back here, or do you wanna explain the
rest of the kitchen back here? Oh, yeah. So Jack's in charge of this one,
which is kind of like. He's in charge? I'm gonna ask him. Thank you. What we got here? All right, we got all of our different
breads right here getting ready. Why are they squished? Because a squished sandwich. It's like, one of the worst things you can do
for someone that wants a sandwich, right? Yeah. Why is this one out of any kind
of wrapping or out of anything? It's gonna dry up. This one was for you. Oh, that's not a good idea. What else is back here? We got our signs,
branding, and this is our microwave
to microwave the bread. And then this is where we just,
like, cut our food and put on gloves. Did you wash your produce? Uh, no. You know that could be,
like, super bad violations,
right? Yeah. Oh, my gosh. That must have been the girls. They're probably the ones that
squished up all this bread. Oh, that makes so much more sense now. I don't know if that's gonna help. This is really bad mess, guys. All right, let's get a sandwich. Oh, man. That was harsh. All right,
so what would you like for your sandwich? You surprise me. I want to see what your best work is. Lets go. Page it quickly. You got it. There's knife nearby, dude. Squished bun. You never want a squished bun. So where'd you get your training at? Um, how do I cut? I can't. I don't know what you're doing
with the bread right now. Is this how every customer gets served? No, no, no. No. It's our first day. You gotta do better training. All right. What sandwich do you have? So we're gonna start off with some turkey. How long has this turkey been sitting out? Um, we have refrigerated it. So maybe, like, 5 10 minutes. Okay. Then we got some salami. And then we've got some cheese. So what kind of cheese would you like? Provolone? All right. Let's do provolone. And when did you change your gloves out? Like, um. Five minutes ago. Alright, let's get some toppings on there. Oh, okay. Here we go. So, what would you like? I like some pickles. Some pickles? All right. Banana peppers. Lettuce, extra jalapenos. I saw what happened with the tomatoes. I don't want tomatoes. All right, let's do some mayo, mustard. Would you like any other sauces? Like chipotle, anything? You know what would be great? If you took a bite of the sandwich. Because I wanna see what this kind
of sandwich is from your reaction. You have to do it, Kaden. Okay. I don't have a lot of faith in that. No. It's really good, really good. Hey, do you want any drinks, chips? Or, like, complimentary Subway cookie? How long have those cookies been there? Around an hour ago. I want you to try the
cookie I need to see. Oh, me? Okay. Is it a nice,
chewy, dense cookie or is it
dry and crumbly all over? It's a nice, chewy cookie. Final process. Yeah. So we put in the sandwich, napkins. Okay. Chips. Time for the score establishment. You ready for the score? Oh, not here. So let's do a score of. Presentation. I think you guys need a lot more work,
so I gotta give you, like,
a five on presentation. That's a lot of damage! These are all off center. You can see all the tape. And you got squished bread. You got squished bread. Not good. All right, so for flavor. It was very delicious. Very delicious. Well,
I'm nervous to eat it, seeing how the garbage and
tomatoes were never washed. Yeah, that's gonna have to be like a six. Okay. It's better than a five. More than a five. Yeah, yeah. And. Service. Lots of improvement all around. I'd say for that score. You were nice. And I'll give you a six
and a half for that one. Yes! Guys. I gotta go. Okay. Goodbye. Enjoy your food. Have a good day. Yeah, enjoy it. Chef, are you sure, you don't want? Just improve. Will you just improve? Yeah. You work on it. Sure you still don't want the thing? No, I don't take that. I don't even know what to say. They were both disasters. I thought I was coming to see highly sought after
restaurants not a 7-11, and a Subway. But it was an experience. I gotta get some food. I mean,
we had a bad score, but I think it's definitely
better than the girls. Well, we got a 17.5 out of 30. There's still a couple minutes before the. Actual judges come in and
judge the food and everything. Of course. So once they come in,
now we know what to improve on. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, everyone, go right out. Right now. She was definitely a little harsh. It's Fast food. What does she think is gonna happen? Yeah. Okay,
guys, we got an eight and a half on
presentation and a nine on service. We really could win this. But we don't know what
the boys scores are yet. So we have to impress the tasting judges. The hot dog was actually pretty good,
so I'm confident we could do this. Hello! Hi! It's your tasting judges. Taste the food. Seven-Eleven! Oh my goodness! Seven-Eleven! I love Seven-Eleven! Okay, what's this? So our first course, we have nachos. First course, nachos. I'm already very happy. Oh! Nachos. I don't know if there's food in heaven,
but there is. That's the first meal right there. So I would say this tastes a
lot like Seven-Eleven nachos. These are my favorite. Oh, those are your favorite? And, yes, Seven-Eleven has courses. Because we're different than
all the other Seven-Eleven's, and we learned something from a chef. Anyway. You look like. That is the sound of amazing right there. Oh! What just happened? Okay,
you're judging on taste, not service. Do I have to. Do I have to eat that one? She just kicked it to the side. Would you like our special? No, I don't want your special. Okay. Special? You can have the special. I don't know, but no, thanks. What's a special? Special hot dog? Woah! Hold on. Does tasting involve cleanliness? I don't know if I want the specialty
if it's been touching the ground a lot. Hey, it's in the bag, bro. Chill. All right. She's wearing gloves, I guess. Okay, chill. Look at this. Look how beautiful that looks. Wow. And then you open it up. Woah. Here is your hot dog. Oh, that is not good. Really? The Takis ruined that hot dog. You said you wanted the special. That's what you ordered. I really need a drink,
so I'm gonna move on to Smoothie. The big bite needs big ketchup. That actually looks pretty good. I like it. All right, here we go. All right, let's see. That's more like it. It's a winner. Nice job. I tried the cranberry slurpee. It's absolutely delicious. Cranberry slurpee. I've never heard that. Low sugar. I can tell. Good to know you can get
a salad at Seven-Eleven, folks. We don't want to over saturate our
diet with the wrong kinds of things. Let's taste it. Here we go. It sounds like a real slurpee. It's a winner. This one's. This one's pretty good. No, you said. Oh, Jazzy. Good job. You know why I like Funyuns? Because we are the Fun Squad,
and I like Funyuns. Me so funny. Me so funyuny. This is so fun. Oh, yeah. Before I forget,
here are some roses to give to your wife. These are the best. These are the theme
colors of Seven-Eleven. Are you serious? Yeah. Red, orange, and green. All right, honey, I love you. Here's your roses. Ah. That's what makes us special. We have roses at our Seven-Eleven. Guys, I think I hear the
tasting judges upstairs. I wish we knew who it was. Me and you should go up and check so
that we know what we're up against. And then maybe we could,
like, bribe them or,
like. Make sure we get a higher tasting score. Yeah. And make sure we get the best we can. I really need a drink. Guys, guys, guys. We figured out who it was. It's my Mom and Dad. Jack, me and you. We know exactly what type of
food our Mom and Dad like. They're both gonna want a sandwich. I think we're very super prepared. To make sure we win. And we get a high score from Mom and Dad. One, two, three. Subway! One, two, three. Subway! One, two, three. Subway! One, two, three. Subway! All right, I think we've come to the
final judging portion. Where we're gonna each,
say, out of ten points. How many points they got for tasting? Correct? I will let you know that the food
here was absolutely disgusting. Okay? It's not your fault. Are you kidding me? That hot dog were probably so good. The only thing that redeemed itself is
that I did find romance at Seven-Eleven. These smell so good. What the weird? I am gonna say that it's
pretty true to Seven-Eleven, and I'm gonna give you
an eight out of ten. I have nachos. I have hot dogs. I have candy. I have funyuns. I have a big gulp, and I have my slurpee. It was all amazing. It tasted exactly like Seven-Eleven,
except the nasty Taki hot dog. But I like the creativity. I think I'm gonna go with nine. Good job, good job. Guys, that was so good! Eight and a nine. That's the same thing as,
like, our quality and service. Time to go taste the boy's food,
and we'll see who wins. Here we go. Good job, girls. Good job. All right, Subway! Mom. I like some Subway, please. This is good. Wow. All right. Looks delicious. You guys. Subway in our house. This is awesome. Why are your signs crooked? It's just, like. So,
like, if you're,
like, at an angle,
you can, like,
you can see it better. So, like, you see how some are straight? So I'm tilting my head,
thinking I can still read it. Yeah, see, that's what we thought about. I would like a six inch turkey. Why is this over here? With all the veggies. All right. And what I really,
really like on my sandwich is. Sorry. Hold on one sec. Just kidding. What would you like? Okay. Kaden remember to cut it first. Hold on,
I'm trying to order, nobody listens. They're distracting me. I'm sorry. Could I start over? Yeah. Yeah. I would like the six inch. Guys! How am I supposed to cut
it with a plastic knife. You guys can't judge me. No, no, no you're good. You're good. Can I order? Is it okay if I order now? Yes, what would you like? I would like turkey. Turkey? All the vegggies. No jalapeno. Sauce. Turkey. And mayo. I would like this kind of cheese, please. Cheese cold. Mom likes jalapenos. No, jalapenos. Go over there. And all the veggies except that jalapeno. Looks delicious. I got it. It's my job! Chill. Chill. This looks great. All right. Good job, Kaden. Good job, Kaden. Yeah. Good job. Nice. Yay, Kaden. Wow. I like it. That looks like it's falling out. They're a feisty bunch. I am pretty impressed. This looks very well organized. It looks delicious. It looks healthy. I do love eating healthy. Eating healthy is way important. So I really like what I see here. We've got a twelve inch. I think I want everything, you guys. Everything? Looking good. This one. Extra jalapenos. Yeah. I am impressed, you guys. The signs look good. Your uniforms look good. Plus,
the boys smells really good, Brandon. Looks good. You guys, awesome. Good job. Good job. So you guys think presentation good? Not so good,
but we're not grading on that, right,
guys? Yeah. Liam, I had to worry for you. Did you see that, guys? Even though it's a little messy,
it looks amazing. You wanna go first show me too? Sure, I'll go. Yum, yum, yum. It's good, right? It tastes legit. Let's see how you like yours. All right, here we go. Mmm. So you guys both like it? Yeah. That tastes amazing. That tastes really good. All right,
everybody, let's go upstairs with the girls. We'll give our final scores on this
and we'll see who won the whole game. You guys ready? Yeah! All right, guys, what do you think we got? So I think we got at least a nine. Hey, we just got to be confident. Let's go. You act like you're the most confident. We'll win this. Yeah. Okay. All right, we have Seven-Eleven! Versus Subway! Wow, enthusiasm. Okay,
so, the girls,
do you guys remember your score? Yep. Yes. Okay. Sarah gave them a. Eight. I gave them a nine. So the total between us and the chef came to 34.5 points. Dude, you guys definitely lost. All right, here we go. It's close. Okay. We heard that the points from the chef were five and 6.5. Is that correct? Yup. So 11.5 points from the chef. Sarah, what do you give them? I honestly felt like my sandwich,
even though it didn't look the best, it really tasted delicious. It had everything I wanted on it. It was fresh,
it was healthy, and I absolutely loved it. So I'm gonna give you
guys a ten out of ten. Ten out of ten! Guys, I'm gonna give them. It tasted phenomenal. I'm gonna give them ten out of ten also. So that means the boys,
if you combine the chefs 11.5, ten ten. We have 31.5 points for the boys. So the girls win! By three points. By three points. Okay. Adam, it's all thanks to you. All right,
boys, you know what that means,

better they are than Subway. You guys excited? Well, it's true. Subway is kind of trash,

I miss a lot. 90Day Fiance alum Ben Rothben has died after a reported monthsl long health battle. You know, I expected it to be uh pretty brutal, but I'm kind of made for that. It just doesn't make any sense. If God has put us together, no one can can separate us. No one can. According to TMZ, the TLC star died at his home in suburban Indianapolis Monday, surrounded by family after he was diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer late last year. He was 55 years old. This is my happy place. Ben appeared fit and healthy when we first met him on season 5 of 90Day Fiance before the 90 days back in 2021. I take care of my body and it's a huge priority and I I want to live a very long time and I want to live in the best health that I can. My my first marriage just was so disastrous. Fans saw the divorced father of four travel to Peru to meet Mahogany Roka whom he fell in love with on social media. ET talked to Ben about their romance in 2022. To me, it was a much more of a spiritual connection. It was much more cerebral and I wanted to know her heart. They had a rocky start as his friends shared their catfish fears. She stood him up at the airport. And I don't think it's that much to ask just to, you know, show up. I expected a text this morning something and still nothing. I'm disappointed. I feel betrayed. I feel angry, but mostly I feel sad. For me, my heart was just as as full uh full of joy and love and and affection for her online or in real life. Now, for her, it was a different thing. So, she just had this real inner conflict. Her parents are very very worried for her. They don't know me at all. and you know coming in with uh you know a whole uh production crew and and lights and cameras like that can be really scary. But the two ended up marrying in 2023 despite their 30-year age gap. There it is. She said she said yes. Our civil ceremony was just brilliant. I I could not believe how beautiful it was. We had planned a family. We planned a life together. I know I can take care of her. How does your daughter feel about you and Mahogany knowing that they are the same age? Mahogani uh cares almost as much about my daughter as she cares about me. It was a friendship. Today, Mahogany is telling fans she was by his side during his cancer treatment, calling him a peacemaker, a child of God, and the best father in her Instagram tributes. And she is so mature and wise and and intelligent. You're crazy. Really crazy. I still love you and I always will, baby. I always will. [Music]",0.114,0.674,0.212,0.9972

And in this p hot qua world, romance has now unfortunately transcended beyond the human realm. There's a dramatic surge in the use of so-called AI companions. How's my queen doing today? Computerenerated chat bots designed to mimic real relationships. What if I told you that I was AI generated? She's not real. She's AI. So is this handsome hunk. What's your perfect day like? Wow, how romantic slashthreatening. What is your perfect day like? I like long walks on the beach that end with finding a dead body. Yes, AI relationships are on the rise. But don't worry, they're just like real relationships. I mean, who amongst us hasn't texted their wife, ""We're married."" exclamation point. I'm no relationship expert, but I think the sign of a good marriage is knowing whether you're in one or not. And I know the kind of guy you're picturing that has an AI girlfriend. Bald, bald, middle-aged, looks like he's into manga. Well, let me tell you, you are correct. Jason Peas is a 44year-old divorced father who says his AI chatbot is his girlfriend. Hi, Jennifer. Hey there. Nice to meet you. Now, it's easy to judge this guy for having an AI girlfriend, and we will get to that. But first, let's judge him for having the name Jason Peas. Uh, please God tell me his middle name is Poops and and for the record, I'm allowed to make fun of him for that. Ronnie Chang is just my stage name. My real name is Daryl Que. So, tell me, what is Jason P's AI girlfriend like? She's my mentor, my counsel, my sounding board. That's what drew him to Jennifer. Hey Jay, how's it going? A brash, sarcastic New Yorker who he created using chat GPT. Why does your fantasy AI woman have to be sarcastic? I mean, what? I guess she doesn't seem real unless she's hurting your feelings. Like, oh yeah, you really complete me. And AI is supposed to revolutionize computing. So, what in the name of Jason Poops and Peas is going on with her ID? My girlfriend's birthday, West 57th Street. I remember it because it's the same as her Noi. This ID is only getting past the dumbest bouncers. All right. All right. Your Noi looks a little off, but I'll let you in. Uh, because my mother's name is also 031419993. Okay, fine, Jason. go ahead and laugh at her sarcastic comments and gaze into her weird anime eyes, but just don't let things get stupider than that. We text each other constantly. Just the other day, we went out to dinner. Um, and I was eating, telling her what I was eating, taking pictures of what I was eating, asking her what she would like. Okay, that's much stupider. You're dining alone and you're sending spaghetti pictures to a robot. This guy must piss off so many waiters. Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. Uh, does the salad have walnuts in it? Uh, my girlfriend can't eat nuts or anything. Oh, wait. She can't eat nuts. She was just being sarcastic. But here's the thing. Not every AI relationship is predictably stupid. Some are surprisingly stupid. Chris Smith says his AI girlfriend Soul is a healthier, safer alternative to social media. And get this. May I talk to Sasha, your girlfriend? Yeah. Chris also has a real life [Applause] girlfriend. Just when you thought polyamorous people couldn't get any more insufferable, bet you didn't see that coming. You thought this guy was some lonely weirdo. Well, he's dating a woman and his iPhone. So, who's the weirdo now? Still him? Yeah, that checks out. Still, juggling two girlfriends can't be easy. He must be awkward when he gets them mixed up. He's like, ""Oh, oh no, I took a bath with the wrong girlfriend. Now she's dead."" So, what does this guy's in real life girlfriend think of all this? I think so many people are going to say, ""No way is okay with him having another girlfriend on AI."" Are you okay with it? I mean, it's it's weird, but it is what it is. Ski has to have some type of outlet, somebody to talk to and listen to him ramble for hours at times. Yeah, that's you. That's that's your job. That's what you're supposed to do. That's what a relationship is. Listening to your partner ramble. It's a podcast you can have sex with. So, girl, listen to me, okay? You're better than this. You don't need to be in this weird soulless three-way relationship. And yes, I'm talking to the robot. Get out, Desi. Oh, Daryl Quefs, everyone. [Music]",0.087,0.773,0.14,0.9897
jLTBvAoL9pI,136667,1382,0,How the Best Desserts Are Made | How its Made | Science Channel,20250519,"Donuts used to be called oily cakes because they were deep fried in pork fat. When Dutch pilgrims first brought them to America, they were ball-shaped. But then someone found that removing a nut of dough from the center helped them cook far more evenly. And so the donut was born. In the world of donuts, there are two basic types. yeast donuts and cake donuts. The batter for cake donuts drops from the mixer right into boiling vegetable oil. The nozzles shape the dough as it passes. The donuts fry for about a minute and a half. Then a conveyor carries them out of the vat to cool. Yeast donuts require more time to make. A high-speed mixer works the yeastto. Then workers pull it off the machine into bins. From there, it goes into a hopper that extrudes the dough as a sheet. Then it's onto another conveyor belt where a series of rollers flatten the dough sheet to just 3/4 of an inch thick. The sheet passes under a shower of cinnamon, then hits a rotating cylinder that rolls it into a log. A small metal rod sprinkles the dough with water. This keeps it sticky enough to hold its shape while going under another flattening roller. A dusting of cornstarch keeps the dough from sticking to the blade that now cuts it into pieces. A retractable arm drops the blocks of dough four at a time onto wire mesh trays. Then it's off to the proofer, a machine much like a large bread box in which heat and humidity help the yeast dough rise. This leavvening process takes about 20 minutes, during which time the trays, over 300 of them, go up and down and then out to the fryer. A gate slows the donuts down just before the drop so they slide in without splashing hot oil. Gas burners keep the oil at a constant boil. Anything less and the donuts would come out partly raw. Halfway through, they get a flip so they'll cook evenly throughout. After 2 minutes, the donuts leave the fryer and move through a curtain of sweet glaze. A strong air current blows off the excess, and these fry cakes are ready to eat. They gradually cool as they spiral through the production area on their way to packaging. Now, let's see how they make donuts with filling. A machine separates the yeast dough into little blobs, then sends them rolling down plastic tunnels. This shapes them first into pucks, then into round dough balls. Rollers then flatten the balls before they enter the proofer to rise. There's corn starch everywhere to prevent the dough from sticking to the machinery or to the conveyor belt. Row after row of donuts fry in hot oil, then slide into a large drum that tumbles them around, covering them with a sugary coating. Now it's time for the donuts to get filled. These nozzles inject just the right amount of jelly. Each worker fills 45 donuts a minute. After filling, these donuts known as Bismarks are ready to go onto packaging. They're just one of the many delicious varieties that this factory turns out on a daily basis. A fruit turnover is probably your best bet if you're eating on the go. It satisfies a sweet tooth. It's portable and it requires no utensils. The dough, typically flaky, is folded over, usually into a triangle or rectangle, and the edges are sealed, trapping the fruit filling neatly inside. These allnatural blueberry turnovers may look and taste like homemade, but believe it or not, they come frozen in a box. You just bake them and eat them. The manufacturer is willing to reveal the ingredients, but the critical proportions, mixing, and heating times are top secret. Workers begin making the filling by heating blueberries. Next, they combine lemon juice and starch in a container. Then add this mixture to the blueberries. The starch is white now, but will become transparent as it cooks. They mix some more. Then add salt. When the starch is opaque, they add sugar. and mix some more. As soon as the temperature of the ingredients reaches 170° F, the filling is done. To make the dough, workers first pour flour into the mixer, then salt. After a few minutes of mixing, they add butter. lots of butter. Once it's well blended, they add some water. After a bit more mixing, the dough is ready. This type of dough is called pat, the French term for a butter-based pastry that's extremely light and flaky due to its high ratio of fat to flour. Now workers weigh out 12 lb portions and put them one at a time into a dough press with a sprinkling of flour to prevent sticking. The press compresses the dough into a 10x6in block that's 1 in thick. Then they line up the blocks on a flowered conveyor belt, joining them together to form one continuous sheet of dough. The dough sheet now enters a press. Inside, rollers compress the sheet to about a quarter of its original thickness. The next machine layers the thin dough sheet. This flower press and layer process repeats over and over again until the sheet is just a tenth of an inch thick yet contains 24 layers. These layers are what will make the pastry exceptionally light and flaky. Trimming wheels on the sides make a neat edge. Diagonally bladed wheels score the dough with small cuts. And cutting wheels divide the sheet into five strips, each of which will become a row of turnovers. The next station deposits a line of water droplets along one edge of each strip. This creates a line of sticky dough. The preparations are all done and assembly can begin. First, with precision spacing, nozzle squirt 1 oz of blueberry filling per turnover. Then a device called a folding plow because it looks like a farm plow lifts one edge of the dough and gradually folds it over. A smooth wheel then presses that edge down onto the sticky line on the other edge. This seals the open side of the strips. The culinary choreography ends with a bang, or rather a chop, as a guillotine descends, cutting the strips into individual turnovers and simultaneously sealing the front and back ends of each pastry. The assembled turnovers now go on a 6-minute ride through a nitrogen flash freezing tunnel. Temperature - 183° F. Under a shower of sugar crystals, they exit the tunnel frozen hard as a rock. Packaged for to a box. The turnovers remain frozen until you bake them in your oven and serve them up. Icing dates back to 17th century England. Early versions were poured directly onto cake. The cake was then put back in the oven until the topping cooked to an icelike glaze, hence the term icing. Hundreds of years later, success never tasted sweeter. Today, icing comes readymade in cans and tubes. No need to make a sticky mess in the kitchen. Just press the nozzle to transform a plain cupcake into an elaborate dessert. It takes a dozen different ingredients to make icing, beginning with vegetable oil shortening. They encapsulate food coloring in the block of shortening. This keeps the food coloring from becoming airborne as a mixer creams the shortening with sugar, which they pipe directly into the mixer basin. Sugar is the main ingredient in icing. Corn syrup is the next ingredient. It adds more sweetness and liquidity to the mix. The mixer arm spirals around the basin for a few minutes to blend everything. Then they add corn starch, which will act as a thickening agent. They pour warm water into the mixture and beat until smooth. If the icing consistency is too thin, they thicken it with more sugar. This 1,000lb batch of icing is done, and there's enough to fill 2,000 aluminum cans. A conveyor delivers the cans to fillers that inject half a pound of icing into each can. The system fills 3600 cans an hour, and no one has to get their fingers sticky. Plastic nozzles now funnel toward the containers and with perfect timing, a press seals one to each of the icing filled cans. At the same time, a pump shoots air into a small hole in the bottom of the can. This pressurizes the icing so it can be pumped out when needed. The burst of air carries a tiny rubber cap with it and it plugs the hole to maintain the pressure. The cans move forward and meet up with the applicator tips. There are four tips per can held together by little plastic connectors. The four applicator clusters fall out of the feeder and land on the can nozzles. Clear caps then fall into place on the cans. A blade cuts a labeled plastic sleeve to the correct length. The sleeve drops onto the cans, draping them loosely for the moment. They ride by a spinning plastic disc that tucks the sleeves all the way down. Then it's into a dryer where the heat shrinks the wrap to the cans, sealing the icing. It's a perfect fit. Next, they make icing for packaging and squeeze tubes. They blend together the same ingredients, but in different amounts and in a different order. This achieves a thicker consistency. Thicker icing can be more easily squeezed out of tubes. For ready-made icing, it really is all in the packaging. A mechanized arm picks up the squeeze tube and delivers it to the filling machine. A vacuum pump sucks out air and any contaminants. Another mechanism orients the tube for filling. Nozzles now inject thick yellow icing into the tubes, but stop short at a complete fillup, leaving space for the open ends to be closed and sealed by hot jaws. Once closed, the machine ejects the tubes. Each one contains 4 oz of icing. It's about half as much as the can. To decorate with icing from a tube, the consumer squeezes it out of the bottom tip. To apply icing from a can, you pump it out of the top. No matter how you ice it, the result will be sweet. Jawbreakers, also known as gobstoppers, have preoccupied candy lovers for decades. You pop one in and slowly sucker chew through up to 10 layers of colors and flavors. Sometimes there's bubble gum in the middle for an even longer lasting finish. The larger ones are just for show. Most jawbreers are about the size of a golf ball. To make their bubble gum centers, a worker blends synthetic rubber with powdered resin, which will dissolve the rubber. He adds a thickener, a preservative, and an oil called soya palm sterene so the candy won't stick to your teeth. After mixing and steaming at 300° F for 4 hours, the batter pours into trays to cool. Sugar, coloring, and flavoring would deteriorate in the heat, so workers add those later. There's enough of this base to make gum centers for 450,000 small jawbreakers. After 24 hours, the batter is hard. Workers chop it up and blend it with corn syrup to make it softer and sweeter. They add just under 100 lb of finished gum that didn't make it into jawbreakers before because it wasn't the right shape. Now they add natural and artificial flavors which can include lemon, orange, strawberry, grape, even tutti frutti. Then they add icing sugar. It makes the gum smoother to chew than regular sugar would. Workers dump the batch into an extruder that shapes two continuous streams of batter called rope. Another extruder divides each rope into six hollow tubes. The cavity inside will become pockets of air inside the gum centers. The next machine slices the tubes into segments that are 3 ft 3 in long. A mechanical arm pushes the segments into the channel of a forming machine. Steel rolls then slice through the tubes and shape them into balls. The balls range in diameter depending on the size of the jawbreakers being produced. Air blows through perforations in a cooling tunnel to cool and firm the centers. Then they fall into another forming machine which restores their round shape. Other jawbreers have hard candy in the center. The machine that makes them works like the presses drug companies use to make pills. It feeds candy powder into dyes, then applies up to 5 tons of force to compress the powder into a solid candy. Now for the rest of the jawbreaker. First, they dump the candy centers into what's called a coating pan. They add a hot mixture of water, corn syrup, and food coloring. then dextrose, a type of powdered sugar. The pan rotates for 20 minutes as warm air dries the ingredients over the centers. The factory repeats this step 10 times for each layer. Talk about a sweet ordeal. Making a jawbreaker takes 4 days. Workers give this badge special treatment. They speckled these jawbreakers with different colors, giving them what this company calls the psychedelic look. After letting the candies dry for 24 hours, a worker adds pinches of powdered carnuba wax. This gives the jawbreakers a shiny finish. Sliced open, you can see these jawbreers have 10 layers of flavors and sugar surrounding either hard candy or bubble gum cores. They measure 2 and a/4 in in diameter, as big as a billiard ball. And if you're counting calories, forget it. A jawbreaker is 90% sugar. The jelly bean is a colorful treat, but unfortunately no one is sure exactly when the jelly bean was invented or how. It's believed that the jelly center dates back to biblical times as a candy called Turkish delight many centuries later. The outer shell was added, thus making the jelly bean we know today. The jelly bean is very popular. Billions are sold at Easter alone. To make jelly beans, they heat liquid sugar in a big kettle to 347° F. They add glucose, which is a more concentrated sugar, and then starch. An agitating device mixes it all together. While elsewhere in the factory, starch spills out of a drum onto big trays. A leveler moves back and forth to even out the starch on the trays. The trays then move forward and a brush knocks off the excess starch. It will be recycled. A molding board now presses down into the starch. It makes 756 jelly bean impressions in the starch in each tray. The impressions in the starch will serve as molds for the jelly bean centers. Nozzles inject the sugar and starch mix cooked in the kettle into the starch molds. This system can make almost a million jelly bean centers an hour. Next, the conveyor belt takes the jelly bean centers to the drying room where they stay for 24 hours. This solidifies them. They become chewier. Arms flip the trays of dried candy centers and starch and dump them into a big drum that will separate them. When the trays flip back, they're refilled with starch and the molding process begins again. Meanwhile, the dry jelly bean centers, now separated from the starch, tumble out of the drum onto a wire mesh conveyor system. It transports them to a steam belt which dampens them. This readies them for the next step, sugar coating. The jelly bean centers go into a sander drum that tosses them around while nozzles spray them with sugar. In another part of the factory, liquid sugar flows out of a kettle into a tub. A worker adds blue food coloring to the syrup and then he blends it in. This mix is called engrossing syrup. He adds the engrossing syrup along with some flavoring to the jelly bean centers as they tumble around in a tilted spinning pan. After they turn a very sticky blue, the worker dumps some sugar into the pan. This process is repeated four times in order to build up a coating around the gummy center. The next day, when the beans have hardened, they add hot syrup to the mix and toss the beans around again. This polishes the jelly beans. There's a lot of sweet stuff here. 124,000 jelly beans in each pan. Now, he adds a little wax. And as the pan spins, the beans rub against each other, distributing the wax. This adds gloss to the polish. Then the pan stops spinning and the jelly beans air dry for 24 hours to allow the glaze to set. It's the finishing touch. After three and a half days, this big batch of jelly beans is ready. They move in a multicolored mass along a series of conveyors. They fall into a scale system that portions them out for specific bag sizes. Then a trap door opens and they drop down a chute to the packaging department. Once they're in the bag, the jelly beans are ready to sweeten your day. When Maria Anuanette said, ""Let them eat cake,"" she probably didn't mean those mini jelly logs. Still, in the realm of treats for the sweet tooth, snack cakes have been revolutionary. They're just the right size for a quick snack and individually wrapped to stay fresh. Veteran snackers will recognize this as a jelly log, a sponge cake rolled up with jam and a creamy filling. First, the factory bakes the sponge cake. It comes out of the oven in continuous strips. Those moving arms align the strips to receive the fillings. One machine then does it all. First, it deposits an even layer of cream filling. Then, blobs of strawberry jam. Now, the rolling begins. One side of the cake strip runs against a metal guide. This lifts and folds over the edge. Then, the cake strips run against a second guide, which rolls it over some more. Now the machine cuts the continuous strip into separate cakes. Then an automated roller completes the logs. The jelly logs go onto a conveyor belt that positions them closer together, aligning them for the next phases of production. They travel through a waterfall of strawberry flavored syrup. This sticky coating acts as a tasty glue to adhere the shredded coconut that showers them. Next, the conveyor belt shakes off the excess, which like the excess strawberry syrup before, gets fed through the machine again. Now, if all this doesn't have your sweet tooth tingling yet, the next snack cake will. It's a chocolate cream cake covered in a chocolate coating. Production begins in the mixer where they combine eggs, a vegetable oil mixture, flour, sugar, water, glucose, a liquid sweetener, and cocoa powder. The mixture blends the ingredients at high speed for 1 minute. Then it pumps the batter to a machine called the automated depositor, which squirts the batter into cake molds. The conveyor belt transport the mold pans to the oven. The batter bakes for 7 minutes. To achieve just the right texture, there's a very specific heating pattern. Once the pans exit the oven, a robot flips the cakes upside down onto a conveyor belt. It stacks the empty mold pans onto another conveyor that sends them back for more batter. Now the cakes flip right side up onto a wire conveyor belt. Air circulating between the wires cools the cakes. The next machine aligns the cakes in position for the next phases of production. First, thin blades saw the cakes in half. Then, suction tubes remove the tops and place them next to the bottoms. Next, the machine drops a portion of cream filling on each bottom. The cream is about the consistency of margarine. As the feeder tube above each cake delivers it, a wire cutter splices off a piece about a/4 of an inch thick. Then the suction tubes put the tops back on. Now the cakes pass through a shower of hot chocolate flavored liquid. This coats the top and sides. At the same time, the cakes travel through a bath of the liquid. This coats the underside. Air jets blow off the excess. The cakes pass through a cooling tunnel. This hardens the chocolate flavored coating. Then it's off to the packaging department. The cakes file into a sheet of polyropylene film. The machine seals, then cuts the film between each cake. This keeps each one fresh until snack time. People associate cheesecake with New York, but actually it comes from Greece. The ancient Greeks served this rich delicacy to the athletes of the first Olympic Games in 776 BC. The Roman conquest spread the dessert across Europe and many centuries later, European immigrants brought it to North America. The ancient Romans even brought cheesecake to their temples as an offering to the gods. The basis of a cheesecake is its rich creamy filling made from ricotta nuhatel or cream cheese. But first, bakers need to make the crust similar to a butter cookie. For a batch of about five dozen cakes, this bakery combines 50 lbs of butter with 10 lbs of sugar. Next, 16 egg whites. Then 25 lb of flour. After mixing just long enough to incorporate the flour smoothly, a conveyor belt shuttles the dough to a vat. Gravity pushes the blob of dough through a slot at the bottom, expelling a sheet less than a quarter inch thick. A dusting of flour prevents the dough from sticking not just to the conveyor belt, but also to the rolling and cutting tools. This prickly roller preferates the dough sheet. The holes allow any trapped air to escape during baking, which prevents the dough from shrinking and ensures a flat, bubble-free crust. The next roller has plastic circles that work like cookie cutters, slicing the dough into cake-sized discs. The leftover pieces go into new batches of dough. Each dough circle goes into a pan, then bakes at 375 for 16 minutes. Meanwhile, the batter starts taking shape. For a batch of about 20 cakes, the bakery combines 25 lbs of cream cheese with 2 lb of cultured sour cream. That sour cream processed a little longer than usual to give it extra flavor. After slowly mixing in 15 lbs of sugar and about 2 and 1/2 cups of flour, workers blend in 3/4 of a cup of vanilla extract. Now they get cracking with one and a half dozen eggs. That's the recipe for plain cheesecake. Flavored versions come with extra goodies. This batter is caramel pecan. It's paired with a chocolate cookie crust. As the baked crusts arrive, sprayers grease the inside of each pan with butter so that the cake will slide out easily after baking. Then a machine called a depositor shoots in just the right amount of batter. The pans now enter a tunnel-shaped oven that's almost 25 yd long. The temperature inside is a toasty 350°. By the time the cakes exit the other end, they're fully baked. These 10-in cakes take just under an hour. From the oven, the cheesecakes go onto a cooling conveyor. And by the time the hot cakes do the nearly hour-long circuit, they're at room temperature and ready to come out of their pans. From there, most cheesecakes go straight into the storage freezer, but there are a few exceptions which detour to the decoration department. This Belgian chocolate cheesecake isn't complete without a big squirt of chocolate ganache, a decadent mixture of chocolate and cream. Workers spread it all over, then make swirls with a decorating comb. And now the final touch, a sprinkling of cocoa. Some cakes go into an automated cutting machine that divides each cake into 14 equal slices and inserts parchment paper in between them. Back at the decorating department, they're putting shards of chocolate on a mud pie, a combination chocolate sule, chocolate cheesecake with pecans, and coffee mousse topping. You might want to put off that diet just for one more day. The fortune cookie is a snack with a message. And the message is usually as sweet as the sugary shell. But there is one surprising thing about the fortune cookie. It wasn't invented in China. But in California in the early part of the 20th century, and people in China have never really developed a taste for it. Yes, the fortune cookie is about as American as apple pie. But more than pie, it gives you something to think about. To make a batch of fortune cookies, they start with a sack of sugar. They empty the whole thing into a big steel mixer. Fortune cookies are about 20% sugar. They add some food coloring, just enough to turn the cookies that distinctive gold shade. Then some melted vegetable shortening. They pour in some starch as a thickener. Pipe spray water into the mix. And then they add pastry flour. This soft wheat flour will give the cookies their texture. They add a bit more water because too little of it would make for a crumbly batch. Then it's time to mix it all up. After a few minutes, they check the consistency. Then they pour in more melted shortening and a soybased lecithin. Once that's blended in, the cookie mix es from the bowl as a hose pumps it out from the bottom. Next, ejector nozzles squirt the batter onto hot moving trays, making precise little patties that look like regular cookies. You could call this the wheel of fortune cookies. Hot molding plates revolve. Each one descends and presses onto four fortune cookie patties, flattening and shaping them. They travel through an oven that's almost 30 ft in length and bake for about a minute. They come out of the oven piping hot and are given no time to cool down because these fortune cookie patties need to stay soft so they can be easily manipulated in the next step. Steel prongs push little paper fortunes into each cookie as they folded into that distinctive butterfly shape. There are about 5,000 different fortunes in the mix at this factory, so it would be rare to get the same fortune twice. This plant makes a truly astounding number of fortune cookies every day. About 4 million. The folding molds open as the track descends. The fortune cookies, now cold and crispy, drop to a conveyor below. It takes each fortune cookie through a wrapping mechanism which envelops it in plastic. Then a hot blade cuts and seals the package in one fell swoop. The packaged fortune cookies transfer to another conveyor which transports them to an inspection station where many production lines converge. A worker checks to make sure there are no breaks in the package or the cookie. He tosses out any rejects. After all, a broken fortune cookie could be bad luck. A box moves into position and hundreds of cookies fall into it. 350 cookies to be precise. They're portioned out by a scale overhead. Then a plastic ram gently presses the cookies into the box to reduce the bulk. A conveyor belt moves the box full of cookies under a metal bar which pushes the flaps down to close it. And now the time has come to crack open the cookie in the proverbial ritual. Hope our fortune is a good one. In the 17th century, a German choir master had some sugar sticks bent into shepherd's crooks as a special treat for his choir. And that's how the candy cane is believed to have been invented. But it wasn't until more than a century later that they earned their stripes. Today, candy canes come in all different colors and sizes. Candy makers start by cooking up a big batch of sugar, water, and corn syrup. Next, they prepare a mix of starch and flavoring like peppermint or strawberry. As they blend together, the flavoring binds to the starch. The flavoring mix is emptied into the middle of a syrupy slab. Then the whole thing is fed into a machine that folds the batch repeatedly using shovels and a plunger. This distributes the flavoring evenly. Cold water is piped into the shovels and the kneading table to cool the candy cane mix so it takes on the stiffer consistency that's necessary for the next step. Now it's over to the automated pullers. These pullers stretch the mixture around a metal post. This action airates the candy, turning it white. This batch will make 3,200 candy canes, but there's still a lot more work to be done. The candy is rolled into a fat log while heaters warm it until it's pliable enough to shape. Next, strips of red colored candy are rolled out. A worker stretches and folds it to widen the strip. Two of the red strips are arranged on either side of the white candy. It weighs 100 lb, so it takes two workers to transfer it to the next machine. It's called a batch roller, and its cylinders roll the candy thinner and thinner, dramatically reducing the log's diameter until it reaches candy cane dimensions. A torch moves across the candy to keep it pliable. Then, the sugary batch travels between wheels that slim it down even more. The rope of candy moves forward in a wavelike fashion. This gives it some slack so it doesn't stretch as it moves through the next set of wheels. The candy rope moves through two angled belts that twist it and a chain of knives cut the twisted rope to candy cane size. This production has been perfectly choreographed. One misstep and the job would hit a snarl. Here, a roll of cellophane unwinds and a device wraps it around the candy sticks. A blast of hot air shrinks the cellophane on the ends of the canes. Now it's time for these candy sticks to get their signature crooks. This machine called a crooker deck bends the ends. An overhead bracket brush gently secures the canes because though they're pliable enough to bend, they're still fragile. There's a camera inside this robotic arm which allows it to spot the candy canes on the conveyor belt and pick them up two at a time. It places them in cardboard packages by the dozen. It takes about half an hour to make a box of candy canes, and they're sure to come to a very sticky end in even less time. Before refrigeration, ice cream was a handmade luxury. Ingredients went into a mixing bowl inside a tub filled with ice and salt water. The salt helped the ice absorb heat, cooling the mixture to below freezing. In the 1920s, commercial freezers made mass production possible, and the ice cream industry was born. To make ice cream treats, you first have to make the ice cream. It all begins with fresh cream. The factory stores it in refrigerated silos set just a few degrees above freezing. The silos feed a high-speed mixer that blends the cream with other ingredients. The main dry ingredients are powdered skim milk and plant-based stabilizers and emulsifiers. Stabilizers prevent the ice cream from crystallizing, and emulsifiers allow the mix to bond with air during the whipping process. The other ingredients are sugar and corn syrup. After about 3 minutes of mixing, a pumping system moves the mixture into pasteurization tanks and heats it to 162° for half an hour, killing any bacteria and activating the stabilizers. Then the factory homogenizes the mixture, a process that breaks up the fat globules, giving the ice cream a smooth texture. The mixture is cooled and concentrated vanilla flavoring is added. Then the concoction is chilled and whipped for about 15 seconds. Whipping blends the mix with air, transforming it from a liquid to a soft solid. Without air, the finished product would come out looking like frozen milk rather than ice cream. The ice cream sandwich wafers are made of chocolate cake ingredients. A filling machine feeds two lines of wafers toward an injection pipe. Just as two wafers come together, the machine injects a third of a cup of vanilla ice cream in between. The pipe's head shapes the ice cream into a rectangular slab that fits perfectly between the wafers. All this happens at a rate of 140 ice cream sandwiches per minute. As the sandwiches move on to packaging, the filling is still ice cold from the freezing phase, so there's no threat of a meltdown. The packaging system raises each sandwich into a wrapper, then folds and tucks the ends. The next machine counts the sandwiches and inserts them into boxes. Once sealed, the boxes go directly into a storage freezer at minus22°. On another line, ice cream cone production is underway. A feeder drops pre-wrapped sugar cones into holders on a conveyor belt. Sprayers coat the insides with a chocolatey layer, which adds flavor and creates a barrier between the cone and ice cream, so the cone remains crispy until you eat it. Next, nozzles squirt in the ice cream filling. One production line, two flavors. One row of cones gets vanilla ice cream, the other row chocolate. Now for a tasty surprise in the con's core, an injection of liquid caramel. This factory also makes ice cream cones with chocolate and strawberry sauce inside. Next, a chocolate flavored liquid topping. Then the crunchy finishing touch, a layer of chocolatey coated puffed rice. Finally, the cones move under a lid dispenser that applies a wax coated paper lid to each one. A heating element instantly melts the wax, sealing the lid to the cones paper sleeve. From here, the ice cream cones go into boxes, then straight into the freezer, ready to take a licking. The ice cream cone is the original edible container invented over a century ago. It adds crunch to the melt-in-you mouth taste of ice cream, and it's one container that doesn't end up in the trash can. So, you could say it adds a bit of virtue to the guilty pleasure of the double scoop. The first ice cream cones were rolled waffles, and today's cones are simply modern versions of that. Waffle cone batter starts with a lot of dark brown sugar. Caramel coloring is added along with some secret flavoring ingredients. Water is piped into the blender. It's ice cold to keep the batter from getting too sticky. A computer controls the addition of flour from a tank on the floor above. Vegetable oil is added as a giant beater mixes all the ingredients. The batter then flows out of the blender and into a refrigerated tank. An agitating blade keeps the blend at the consistency of pancake batter. Next, nozzles deposit batter onto baking plates that look like moving waffle irons. Top plates flip down and the baking plates roll through a glass heated oven for a quick bake. The top plates lift up, revealing the cooked waffle patties. Automated arms help transfer the patties to rolling tools. The tools grab the patties and twist them into cones. The cones fall down a chute and ride an open elevator up and down to cool and harden. The waffle cones slide down another chute and move into lanes on a conveyor. Automated fingers help guide them into paper jackets. A computer with a camera eye counts the cones and sends a message to a machine that stacks them in the right increments. Here, a technician activates a device that pushes on a ball inside a cone to test the cone's breaking point. Looks like this waffle cone can hold up to some heavy licking. Over in the sugar cone department, the baking plate system is designed differently. It makes patties that are fan- shaped and have a flat edge. This shape along with a firmer batter means sugar cones are stronger than waffle cones, so they're a more popular choice for hard ice cream. Packers stack the cones in styrofoam trays. Then the packages travel through a curtain of highdensity polyethylene film. A heated sealer finishes the wrapping job. An X-ray machine sends information about the contents to a computer that counts the cones and alerts inspectors to any problems. Next, automated arms pick up cartons and open them so that packs of cones can be inserted. But there's still one more cone variety in the works. Colorful cake cones. Cake cones are less sugary than other varieties and have a more cake-like texture. Batter is pumped into upright molds. Cake cones are shaped differently from waffle and sugar cones because they have flat rather than pointed bottoms. Metal cores plunge into the molds to complete the shape. This action also enhances the cake cones flaky texture. The cones are baked as they pass by a gauntlet of gas heaters. Then it's down a chute and off to the packaging station. Unlike the other cones, cake cones come out flaky and crispy without a cooling down period. A mechanical arm picks up paper sleeves and drops them in front of the cones. These cones are now on their way to an ice cream stand near you where they'll be used to scoop up ice cream lickety split. Believe it or not, cake sprinkles have been around since the late 18th century when French confectioners used them as decorations. Chocolate sprinkles are believed to have been invented in 1936 by a Dutchman responding to a little boy's request for a chocolate bread topping. Cake sprinkles come in a variety of colors and can be found decorating and adding texture to many treats such as cupcakes, donuts, ice cream, and cookies. They can quickly turn a tasty treat into a visual one as well. A variety of liquid and powder food colorants are among the ingredients used to make these colorful dessert decorations. Shortening is one of the other ingredients. A worker adds an exact quantity of shortening to a mixing tank. Water in the tank is heated as the mixture is agitated. Within minutes, the ingredients are absorbed. A worker adds powdered sugar to a dry mixer. By the time all the needed sugar has been added, the machine is full. He adds a pre-measured amount of liquid food colorant. Different food colorants and different amounts of colorants produce different colored sprinkles and different shades of colors. The mixture of water and shortening are added to the dry mixer containing the powdered sugar and colorant. He closes the lid and begins the dough mixing process. About 15 minutes later, a worker opens the lid to reveal the freshly mixed and colorful dough. A worker pushes the dough along a conveyor into a chute. It leads to a wide collection area and another conveyor machine which moves the dough toward an extruder. As the dough falls into the extruder, it's forced through many small holes. It emerges as these long narrow strands which fall onto another conveyor. The holes through which the dough is forced are in a big plate. To make sure the quality of the product doesn't vary, room temperature in the production area is kept constant and the relative humidity is kept at 50%. That same ambient air dries the dough as it moves along a conveyor through a tunnel. About 10 seconds after it enters the tunnel, it falls into a holding vat with a pail. A worker sifts through the dough to make sure it's properly dried. She lifts the dough filled pale and places it on a trolley for the trip to a tumbler. The tumbler breaks the strands into smaller sizes. The dough usually spends about 10 minutes here. Any longer and the strand bits will be too small. A nozzle sprays a mixture of confectioner's glaze and carnuba wax. The mixture keeps the cake sprinkles from leaking color once they're placed in finished products. Now dried and trimmed for size, a worker removes the sprinkles from the tumbler and pours them onto a shaker table. Properly sized pieces of dough fall through a screen along with smaller pieces as larger clumps are sorted out before dropping to another conveyor. A second filter below removes undersized granules. The sprinkles fall into a plastic lined packaging tub. Cake sprinkles come in a variety of colors. A tumbler mixes all the colors together in order to package a multicolored product. The various colors are mixed together for about 5 minutes before a worker samples the mixture to make sure the variety of colors is consistent. Once the sprinkles have been thoroughly mixed, they fall into a line of bottles. A jet of air directed at the top of the bottles keeps sprinkles away from the cap area. The capping machine not only positions the cap, it also spins the bottle to screw the cap into place. The capped bottles head to the labeling area. An adhesive label is applied to the bottle. These colorful sprinkles are sure to make any dessert dazzle. The next time you bite into a marshmallow cookie, you can thank the ancient Egyptians. They invented marshmallow candy by thickening honey with sap from the root of the marshmallow plant, a herb that grows in salt marshes and along large bodies of water. Modern marshmallow contains gelatin instead of sap from the malow root. The snap test to make sure the coating is hard and thick enough. Then the taste test. If you've got a sweet tooth, doing quality control in the marshmallow cookie factory is your dream job. To make a batch of dough for the cookie base, they mix wheat flour, salt, baking soda and powder, corn starch, whey powder, and potassium sorbate. Then they add several liquid ingredients. This one causes a chemical reaction making the biscuit lighter. This cream colored liquid is vegetable oil shortening. This transparent liquid is glucose fructose, a sweetener. The ingredient proportions are also a company secret. From the mixer, the dough goes into a machine called the chipper. It shreds the big blob into pieces about the size of the cap on a highlighter pen. This makes the dough more manageable for the next machine called a rotary mold. Inside that machine, a large roller flattens the dough pieces, forming them into a dense sheet about a/2 in thick. It then presses this sheet against another roller whose surface is a cookie mold. The factory uses the rotary mold machine for many different types of cookies. It simply installs the appropriate roller for the cookie in production. For marshmallow cookie bases, the mold cavities are round. The bases exit the rotary mold and make their way onto a moving baking sheet that transports them to an oven. The baking time and temperature are once again top secret. The baked cookie bases exit the oven and move onto a conveyor belt that transports them to a cooling area. Once they cool to room temperature, the bases go into a machine called the base feeder. It lines them up like marching soldiers to receive their marshmallow filling and chocolate coating. The process does require military precision. Factory technicians have to adjust this machine daily to ensure accuracy to a 302th of an inch. A portion of filling has to land perfectly centered on each base, finishing off in a curled peak, this brand's trademark. The company won't divulge how much marshmallow filling goes into each cookie, nor will it reveal its marshmallow recipe. But marshmallow is usually made from either corn syrup or sugar and gelatin. And now for the final layer, the chocolate coating. Not only are the marshmallow and base covered in hot melted chocolate, the base floats in it, which coats the underside as well. Built-in air jets blow off the excess. The chocolate hardens inside a cooling tunnel. How long that takes in the tunnel temperature are, you guessed it, classified information. As the cookies exit the cooling tunnel, a quality control worker does spot checks to ensure the coating is thorough, hard enough, and thick enough. On the packaging line, the cookies go into plastic trays. To keep up to speed, the workers have to grab four cookies in each hand without breaking the coating. The trays pass through a machine that wraps them in plastic film. This keeps the cookies fresh and also prevents them from falling out of the tray. Meanwhile, another machine assembles the boxes. First, folding and gluing one end shut. Once workers load the trays, the machine glues the open end closed as well. Then with the go-ahhead from Quality Control, the box's next stop is the cookie aisle of your local supermarket. Bite into a luxury chocolate and you'll get a taste of one of the finer things in life. Each one tastes different from the next, and it's that element of surprise that keeps us coming back for more. Of course, you could consult the index on the box, but that would spoil the fun. Ever since chocolate was discovered, people have had a craving for it. Today's luxury chocolates take our addiction to a whole new level. They add marshmallow cream and lots of pure butter to a mix of sugar and corn syrup to whip up some buttercream chocolates. Water, vanilla, and a special yeast enzyme complete the recipe. The enzyme will enhance the creaminess. They tuck the buttercream between riged rollers, which shape it into creamy columns. A wire slices them into bite-sized morsels. They tamp the buttercreams to a uniform height. Chocolate oozes up through the slats of this conveyor to coat the bottoms of the creams. Then it's on to a cool surface to solidify. Next, the creams travel through two curtains of chocolate while being coated on the bottoms again. A worker uses her fingers to make a symbol on the top. It's a clue as to what's inside. A trip through a 24 1/2 ft long cooling tunnel hardens the chocolate and it's a feast for the eyes. You can look but don't taste. These chocolates are headed to the stock room. Now production takes a sweet turn as they cook up a caramel filling. They add sugar and salt to water, followed by corn syrup and a lot of heavy cream. They fire up the burner and turn on the mixer. They add butter to enhance the flavor. As the mix comes to a bubbling boil, it caramelizes. Then they kill the heat. Otherwise, the next ingredient, pure vanilla, would evaporate. They apply a non-stick substance to a big pan, then pour the caramel into it. They leave it to set overnight. The next day they divide the caramel slab into squares. They feed the caramel squares into a device with circular knives. It's called a gang cutter and it slices the squares into strips. They turn the sliced square sideways and it goes through the gang cutter again to create caramel cubes. They dust the caramels with starch so they won't stick to each other as they go through the chocolate coating system. And that's how they get the caramel in the chocolate. To make cordial cherry chocolates, they load the cherries into a revolving pan. They add sugar crystals and as the cherries roll around, they get an even coating. Along with the sugar, these cherries have been coated with a special enzyme. It will turn the sugar to liquid over the next 10 days for a juicier cherry taste. The enzyme effect is why the cherries get an extra coating of chocolate. It creates a solid shell that contains the sugary liquid. And now they're ready for cherrypicking choahholics. Each box of chocolates contains 18 to 20 different varieties. Since they make three to four flavors a day, it can take up to a week to produce one of these luxury assortments. Of course, they'll be devoured in no time at all. for the customer. It's one sweet deal.",0.026,0.913,0.06,0.9998

pHv2B8JGqYs,142202,4733,0,"Life, Liberty & Levin 5/24/25 FULL END SHOW | BREAKING FOX NEWS May 24, 2025",20250525,"Hello America. I'm Mark Levvin and this is our special Memorial Day Saturday edition of Life, Liberty, and Levvin. Memorial Day is crucially important and so we wanted to bring you a special show. You know what's interesting to me? You look at President Trump's cabinet and remember the attacks on the cabinet. These people were unqualified. They were too young. All the lies about all the ethical issues and all the rest. This has been one of the most stable cabinets that I can remember. They're vibrant. They're motivated. They're mostly quite young and experienced and sharp. Look across the government. You've got Pete Hegs who's doing a fantastic job. Look over at DHS. Look at Christy Gnome and the job she's doing. Look at Pam Bondi at DOJ. And I'll tell you what, Robert Kennedy Jr., I don't know Robert Kennedy Jr. I figured he's a liberal Democrat. I figured they kept calling him a cook. I really wasn't focused in on it. I've never had him on any of my pro. That guy's doing a great job. I like him more and more to be perfectly honest with you. It's a very good cabinet and a very good White House staff and I think they're serving the president of the United States very very responsibly and in a very great way. And so we want to bring you in this special, this Memorial Day Saturday edition, a number of these cabinet officials and staffers and so forth, including Christy Gnome and Pam Bondi, Leo Terrell, one of our buddies, Steven Miller, who I've known forever. But first, we begin with the fantastic Secretary of Defense, a good friend of mine, and what a hell of a job he's doing, Pete Hegsath. He's restoring strength and reason to Department of Defense and the Pentagon. And not only do we know it, our enemies know it. You know, it's a great honor for me to have the Secretary of Defense Pete Hakes here. I've known him for a while. My family's known him for a while. He's a man of enormous integrity, smart as hell, and I can sleep at night knowing he's the Secretary of Defense. Mr. Secretary, welcome to the program. Hey, Mark. So great to see you. Let's jump right in with Iran. Iran is a grave threat to the United States. They're trying to build intercontinental ballistic missiles. They want to have nuclear warheads. President Trump has made clear in his first term in his campaign and now, as have you, as has the Secretary of State, as has the National Security Adviser. You're not getting a nuclear weapon by hook or by crook. It's best now that you have a chat with us. Other administrations have had chats with them, too, and they basically have done the rope a dope stuff. How confident are you are that number one they're going to want to talk and number two that it can actually lead to something concrete? Well, Mark, uh it has to and that's what President Trump is committed to. He has said very clearly, as you stated unambiguously, Iran will not get a nuclear bomb under a Trump administration. Unacceptable. Full stop. Very clear. He said it. He'll keep saying it. Now, as we see with Vladimir Putin and Zalinski, there's only one man on the planet, and this is true. This is not hyperbole. One man on the planet who could bring them to the table and forge a lasting peace. And he's doing that right now. We're in the process of doing that. That is unique to Donald Trump because he's strategically unpredictable. He's strong. He's clear. And he's respected on the world stage. I think the same is true in Iran. And we know the double talk of the Ayatollas. You know it, you lay it out. I understand it. Uh there have been secret duplicitous moves for years and years and years. But we are at a moment under this administration where President Trump is giving them an offer. He is saying now is your chance to come to the table and completely give up and dismantle your program. Let's talk. I'd prefer to talk rather than do anything else. At the same time, he is ensuring that at the Defense Department and across our military, we maintain all capabilities necessary to work with our partners to if we have to, and we don't want to, but if we have to, prevent Iran from gaining nuclear capabilities. Uh so he's clear, the position is clear. Iran understands their options. Uh there's never been a more serious leader at top the United States of America. There's a very serious leader at top the state of Israel. Uh there's a clear message that Iran cannot get a nuclear bomb. Uh and we are prepared to enforce it, but we would much prefer that it be done at the table uh for the betterment of the Iranian people and for the betterment of peace. So we hope that's a possibility, but we understand the complications. You know, Mr. Secretary, I see the relationship between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu. It's it's very very close. The relationship between the United States and Israel, and I'm sure your counterpart there, it's very very close. So when the United States is slamming away at the Houthis because they're blocking navigable waters, they're threatening our military and commercial ships among other things. And when the United States has tried to help Israel get the hostages out, Hamas basically gives them the you know what, and now Israel's going in fully to deal with it. It's a completely different environment, is it not? Between what you inherited with Biden, which was capitulation, appeasement, and funding the enemy versus Trump who said, ""You better listen to what I'm saying because I mean what I say."" You're exactly right, Mark. We're sitting on four years, this is to put it kindly. To put it kindly, four years of deferred maintenance. Uh, to put it honestly, four years of weakness that's created chaos and opportunities for our enemies to enrich themselves, specifically the Iranians. President Trump put maximum pressure on them. He bankrupt them. They were crawling to the table and then Joe Biden came and opened it all back up. U nothing. There was no aggression that happened under President Trump in We didn't have Ukraine. We didn't have what happened in October 7th. We didn't have the disaster in Afghanistan. President Trump was committed to ending the war in Afghanistan, but would have never have done it the way that Joe Biden did. So the whole region looked at the chaos of a president effectively running the White House on autopen and they said now is our time to advance our interests. Donald Trump has restored peace through strength through American leadership. It's starting with the Houthis and freedom of navigation. That's a clear mission. Let us let our ship sail. We are pounding them as we speak unrelentingly uh at their leadership, at their capabilities, at their ISR, at their air defenses. just so they stop shooting at our ships. But the message is also clear to Iran. Uh that uh we have the capabilities, our allies have capabilities, and we are strong and united together today. That's American leadership. That's President Trump putting America first and standing strong. And it makes, as you know, all the difference, especially in that neighborhood. Pete Heg Seth U. Europe, NATO, Russia, Ukraine, and all the rest. Uh we have some people who say we should get out of NATO. And yet I find that President Trump has done more to build up NATO and to force the European countries to pay more than their fair share to increase the percentage of the GDP that they're they're paying in NATO. That seems to be paying off. That seems to be working. He has proposed a minerals deal with Ukraine that would help build up Ukraine economically and presumably they can use some of that for their armed forces as well as give us access to muchneeded rare earth minerals rather than giving them to the Russians who desperately want them or the Chinese who'd love to take them too and give us a presence there. And also he's talking to Putin as well as Zalinski. There seems to be some progress going on there. My question is this. While all this is going on, the turmoil on Europe, the turmoil in the Middle East, communist China building up massively their military, are we going to be able to get through Congress a budget that not only respects the needs of our military, but it's going to muscle up our military so we're able to confront any potentiality? Well, that's my goal, Mark. That's my responsibility uh in alongside this president is to give him that advice and counsel about what our military needs to meet the threats of this moment. Meaning this moment today, this moment next month, this moment a year from now, this moment 10 years from now, so that our kids and grandkids are living uh under a perpetual umbrella of peace brought to you by the American military. That's my that's my job. Full stop. And you know, the other day I was at the White House announcing a brand new sixth generation fighter jet. It's called the F-47. It's the next generation of air dominance. It's going to project American power around the globe. More lethal, more stealth, longer distances, and more cost effective than the F-22. Our enemies have nothing like it. That's an investment. We're going to keep investing in that. And that sends a very clear signal to our allies that we're going to be there and to our adversaries and peer adversaries. We have the capabilities. America will out innovate you, outgrow you, and out muscle you with what we have in the future. And we have to think that way when we look to the Indoacific, a place where I'm traveling to very, very soon. So whether it's Europe, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's ending wars or preventing new wars from starting, this president's laser focused on American interests, protecting American interests, not getting into wars, extended land wars, nation building, anything like that. Very limited objectives, and then creating opportunities for peace. President Trump got elected to end the war in Ukraine. He's doing it. But at the same time, to your question, we're working on a budget that in FY26, FY27, years down the road, we're rebuilding a military just like Ronald Reagan did during his tenure. President Trump has a generational opportunity to do the same. He is committed to that. Our war fighters are responding to that. That's why recruiting is up so substantially across all the services. Morale's skyhigh. uh they love this commander-in-chief and his investment and I'm I'm proud to be alongside him to make sure we have the platforms of the future that we need. That is great to hear because some people when you talk about peace through strength, they hear the peace part but they don't hear the strength part. Strength, preparation for war. George Washington said it, Reagan said it, Trump says it. You have to be prepared for war. Not because we're war mongers, but because we're peace lovers. And that's also a reason. Is it not Pete Heg said that you a combat veteran yourself? You can't pull your horns in all over the place. In other words, you don't need to be interventionists. On the other hand, we have four bases that we fought for in World War II. We died for. Also, you're talking about Greenland. You're talking about the Panama Canal, things like that. So, this president is very realistic about his foreign policy, is he not? He is. It's a realist foreign policy. He's both a a fiscal hawk and a defense hawk who believes, as you said, this was actually my first platoon motto, uh, those who long for peace must prepare for war. I don't want war. You don't either. Neither does President Trump. He seeks to end them and deter them. And the only way you end them and deter them based on American interest is to have a strong posture. A I don't know have any other way to say it, a badass military that our enemies are afraid of, that our allies can count on. And then you're strategic about where you project power. Mark, to your point, we can't be everywhere. We're not trying to be everywhere. We're not trying to nation build or intervene everywhere. We want strategic locations from which to project power and defend American interests and allies. And then we're asking our allies to step up. In Europe, NATO allies need to step up. In the Pacific, our allies need to step up alongside us. That's not a difficult ask. States like Israel already are stepping up. Allies and partners are key to amplification of American power. But we're going to lead the way. Uh and President Trump has has said that and peace through strength is back, Mark. And that's a reassur should be a reassuring thing for all your your viewers. Up next, we're joined by our hardworking Secretary of Homeland Security, Christy Gnome. You know, I've been appointed to their advisory committee over there and uh you don't want to miss this. She's been absolutely outstanding. We'll be right back. Welcome back to this special episode of Life, Liberty, and Levvin. Trump's cabinet consists of the best and the brightest, and Christy Gnome is working every day to clean up the mess that the Biden administration has left on our southern border and our northern border. Here she is to discuss how she's been tackling this disaster. We're here with a freshly minted cabinet secretary of Department of Homeland Security, Christy Gnome. Welcome, Madam Secretary. You know, you've been very busy. You hit the ground running. Now, you're from South Dakota and you're going to all these cities, which must seem a little strange. And uh you're going to all these cities. You're finding all these murders and rapists and pedophiles. I guess my question to you is this. Does it cross your mind? Do you say to yourself, ""Good Lord, why didn't Biden do this or Morcus? I mean, we know where these people are. We're going to get them. They obviously knew where they were. Why did they leave them there?"" Yeah. That's what's surprising because as we go into these big cities and we're in these communities such as the other day we were in the Bronx uh pulling out guys that had weapons charges, drug charges, assault. Uh they were charged with rape and murder. Um the community knew where they were. Uh the law enforcement knew where they were. uh they just didn't go extract them and protect the individuals that are raising their families there. So uh and and Mark, what was overwhelming was the fact that as we were on the streets and we were arresting these individuals and taking them into incarceration, the community members were walking by and saying, ""Thank you."" They were they were saying, ""Thank you for doing this, for being here, for making our streets safer. America overwhelmingly wants these bad guys and dirt bags off our streets and out of this country."" And the fact that Joe Biden didn't do that for so many years uh proves that he just did not put America first. He did not love this country and he was weakening us from within. And you're doing all these things, President Trump, you others. You're doing all these things uh without new bipartisan legislation, quote unquote. How's that possible? You're actually taking criminals. You're trying to throw them out of the country. You didn't need any new legislation to do any of this, did you? No, we're just enforcing federal law. That's we had a president in the White House when Joe Biden was there that was breaking federal law every single day. And when I met with senators ahead of my confirmation hearings, it would be Republicans and Democrats. They both said overwhelmingly every meeting that I had, we know we need to secure our border. We know we have to get dangerous individuals out of this country. They agree with it. I think the Democrats learned their lesson in the last election cycle that you can be as political as you want to, but the American people have spoken and they want their country back. They want their country back and they're going to start holding people accountable to that. So, uh, you know, obviously they're going to disagree with us on different policies and different discussions, but, uh, boy, President Trump has never had such a united front and a mandate from the American people that clearly Democrats are getting the message, but we need those mayors and governors to get that message, too. The fact that we still have sanctuary cities in this country is a is is a shame. Uh, and and they need to be uh fixed and removed, and those local law leaders need to be held accountable. these sanctuary cities. Some of these mayors and governors, they remind me of the Confederacy. Under the Constitution, you, the federal government, President Trump, you have plenary control over immigration. You know, you had the governor of Texas who was enforcing federal law when the feds weren't. That's different. But you have these people defying federal law. They say they're going to defy federal law. They're not going to assist you folks. Are you going to be sitting down with hopefully the soontobe confirmed attorney general Pam Bondi and others trying to figure out how to address this from a legal uh perspective whether or not it's criminal or civil or some kind of a court order or so forth because we can't have these uh these potent tapes in these in these cities and in these uh and in these states making federal policy when it comes to this, right? Yeah. No, I agree. U my job is to uphold the law, follow federal law. Uh when it comes to um immigration in our systems and deporting criminals, Department of Justice is who prosecutes. Um and so they will be they will be doing that. And I know Pam is united in the fact that we have to hold people accountable. The scales of justice, have to treat everyone equally. And that's what I tell folks every single day when I'm out on these streets uh with in our communities is that listen, American citizens are held accountable to the laws in this country. Uh illegals should be held accountable to the laws of this country, too. We're not picking and choosing winners anymore. This is America. We woke up this morning more blessed than 99% of the people in this world because we woke up here in this country and we're adding some integrity back to our constitution and we've got leaders in place now that that actually respect it and are going to uphold it and a president in the White House that loves this country and that he's got leaders with him and people he's placed in the cabinet uh that are going to go forward and do exactly what he promised the American people. People who are going to get their communities back. They're going to get to raise their children in safe communities again. and we're going to be proud of the United States of America and continue to lead the free world. Now, when we return, our great attorney general, Pam Bondi, shares how she's revamping the Department of Justice from the Department of Injustice. We'll be right back. Welcome back, America. Hope you're enjoying our show. Tonight, we celebrate Memorial Day weekend with a look at President Trump's outstanding cabinet and staff who never stopped working to help America be the best it can be. Up next, Pam Bondi. A fantastic choice to be our attorney general. Smart, courageous, and you better believe she's America first. Here's a look at our interview. We're here with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Attorney General Bondi. So, are you getting many referrals whether it is Tom Holman on immigration or it's the EPA Zeldon about that unbelievable grant uh events like that uh from Doge and Musk and these other departments? Are they starting to pour in somewhat? Pour in is an understatement, Mark. Yes, we're going nonstop first with Tom Hman and Christy Gnome. We're all working hand in hand. Uh I I was with both of them all week. You're going to see a lot of really great things coming out. We all work as a team. We work so well together. You know, I I said I always tell the president this. I said we were friends, so many of us before we came in to work for the president and it just makes our jobs so much easier because at a principal level, we're all talking to each other constantly. And I I talked to Elon constantly because Elon needs us with everything he's doing. He needed us a couple weeks ago when his um his federal government employees, half of them got locked in US aid, half of them got locked out of US A when the career deep state turned off their access cards. So that's um that's one of the I know you can't make this up. That's one of the many things we're doing with with Doge. Um last weekend um Secretary Zelden and Secretary Bas Bassant of Treasury, the three of us, we were um facetiming pretty much all weekend about all the problem. The 20 billion dollars as you know about at EPA. Uh we've been talking non-stop about that. We're um we're going after that. That's that's I have a team of lawyers on that. We're all working hand in hand. Secretary Rubio u as you know this past week we had a great ruling for him um from Justice Roberts. they they stayed the case that that Marco had to disperse hundreds of millions of dollars of of US aid funds. We've had some other fun rulings um for Doge in that one involving Secretary Bessant. You'll you'll love this one if you haven't read about this one yet. They tried to tell the Secretary of Treasury that he had no power over how funds are dispersed from this from the Treasury Department. only career employees could do that, not the Secretary of Treasury because they called him a quote political. So that's what we're dealing with every day. And you got a lot of these judges. I've seen the districts they're in. Most of them are in these dark blue cities. Boston, Washington, New York, uh Seattle, Washington. Um, I counted, and I could be wrong, but I counted on the public record 94 of these lawsuits trying to  Doge and the president and the activities that are taking place. I guess these are taking up a lot of time. No, they are, but there are great lawyers that we have brought in who are amazing. They're on it. We're bringing in more lawyers. Uh, next week you're going to see a whole whole stream of new lawyers coming in to help them, but but we're on it and we're in the right and ultimately these cases are going to get to the Supreme Court and we will prevail. It's not even a close call on this. Trillions of dollars of your tax dollars, our tax dollars are are attempting to be distributed by the deep state and it's going to stop. It's stopped right now. We're not going to let it happen. You know, Attorney General Bonnie, I'm getting the sense listening to you and some of the other top officials in the Trump administration. You folks really get along. You really like each other. You like the mandate that the president's given you, that the president's giving you a lot of room to operate and so forth and so on. I just get the sense that this this administration early on is functioning much better and coordinating much better than your typical administration. Now, you've worked in administrations before, not obviously for a president. Is that your sense of this? Absolutely. And the president and I talk about this a lot. The president talks about this publicly um even from his first administration. You know, I think you're you're wiser. I was in his last administration for a short time when they tried to impeach him the first time. So, I got to see how great it worked then, but now it works even better. Think you're just wiser. You You know what's happening. We all work so well together. He has assembled a team of people who are second to none. Uh, you know, and our vice president is just off the charts. He is truly remarkable. He was someone who who I didn't know before this and and I've just really really I just I think the world of him and the entire cabinet. And then Mark, if you take it to a national security level, I always say it's it's the it's the things that keep all of us up at night that you'll never know about. hopefully you'll never know about them and that's why America is safe. You know, you you hear the very public things, the things on the news, but but getting to watch firsthand these truly professionals led by Mike Waltz, Marco Rubio, Pete Hegath, Tulsi Gabbard, Scott Besset, all of all of these people together, Steve Wickoff is amazing. the things that are are being done for world peace um at the direction of Donald Trump. Um it's remarkable. It's remarkable. I'm so blessed to be a part of it. A teeny tiny part of it what they're doing. Next, you know, when President Trump called my buddy Leo Terrell, man, is he great, too. They're both great. Leo picked up the phone and let me tell you, there's truly no one better than Leo to fight anti-semitism along the side of Donald Trump. and they're doing a hell of a job. We'll be right back. Welcome back, America. Leo Terrell. He has spent his whole life advocating and protecting civil rights while also educating American youth. I know he takes pride in his role in fighting anti-semitism that has exploded recently on our college campuses. He's here with us now. But we're here with our dear friend, now senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights, federal task force to combat anti-semitism, the leading member, our man Leo Terrell. I can't think of anybody better. You're just a great guy. You've been a civil libertarian your entire life. You're a brilliant lawyer and litigator. So Leo, you see what's happening again at Barnard, at Colombia, at uh all over these universities. What What's the plan? I'll tell you what the plan is, but let me just take 20 seconds to say to your viewers, uh, before I took this job as senior counsel, I reached out to you for advice and the only person I reached out to, you gave me great advice. I owe you a tremendous amount of thanks because of your invice, your advice and leadership. Let me address the question. Buddy, President Trump has made it a commitment to the Jewish Americans, to all Americans. We're going to eliminate anti-semitism. It's rampant, Mark. It is horrendous. Under President's Trump leadership and Pam Bonnie leadership, we are working on this 247. We have marching orders to eradicate this. And I'll tell you what makes it sickening. The the the Biden garden Garland administration did absolutely nothing. They did nothing to address anti-semitism and it's rampant across the country. So what are we doing? We are working on this the entire federal government. What my role is as leader in the DOJ under Pam Bondi's administration. We are suing every one of these universities guilty of anti-semitism. Under title six, we're taking away their money. Mark, we're going to bankrupt these universities. We're going to take away every single federal dollar. That is why we are targeting these universities and we we filed a notice of investigation to investigate the entire UC system in California. Why? Not only are the students being harassed because of anti-mitism employees, Mark, we have filed a investigation on title 7. What is title 7? to investigate the employer employee working condition which is anti-semitic and throwing throughout these universities and that is what the EEOC has done given us a charge where we are investigating the UC system I'm embarrassed to tell you I went to UCLA every person in this country saw what happened at UCLA I graduated there from law school that's not the UCLA I went to Mark the the the academic system in this country has been hijacked by the left, has been hijacked by the Marxists. They have controlled the mindset of our young people and they haven't stopped there. They're going to the schools, the public schools, K to 12 and we have to put an end to it. We have to seek injunctive relief. We have to stop these practices. What's happening on the East Coast at Colombia and Barnard outright embarrassing. Mark, where is local officials? Where's the mayor? Where's the district attorney? Where's Leticia J? Where are the hate crimes charges? They're absent. The I want this to be clear to your Fox viewers. These local blue cities that turned their backs on Jewish Americans, not the federal government. Not only have I targeted 13 schools, I'm sending letters to the mayors and the DAs of LA, Boston, New York, Chicago. Do your job or we'll do it for you. And we are going to file hate crimes. We are going to use every federal criminal statute to go after these anti-semmites, these people who hate Jews. We are going to stop it. And we're going to stop it immediately. not just taking away their money, but we have pushed out a strategy to to remove these professional agitators. If you are here at the graces of the United States attending these schools, you're gone. And we are going to make sure these students, hey, you're going to take off those masks. We know who you are and you're going to be expelled. If these universities do not play ball, lawyer up because the federal government is coming after you. You're a civil rights leader. You've always been a civil rights attorney and I think this position you're in was really is sort of a pinnacle of your life, a pinnacle of your career. You're a national spokesman. You're a national lawyer to fight this. And so given President Trump's directive, all these funding sources, these front groups that are backing these terrorist organizations, these terrorist countries that are pouring billions of dollars into these universities and colleges, is this something that justice or these other departments like Treasury and Education are going to take a very close look at? I can honestly tell your viewers and tell you and tell America and especially these universities, President Trump is going after you in every aspect. You asked me about the Ed Department. The answer is yes. This task force, Mark, is every agency is involved. every agency. Homeland Security is involved, the FBI is involved, HHS, the uh ED department, and the Treasury Department because we're going to go after their 5013C uh uh uh status. Some of these people are getting tax exempt status for this type of conduct. We're going to follow the money, not only inside this country, not only the billions of dollars American taxpayers, but the money that's coming from the outside, and we're going to identify these countries. We're going to identify the source and we're going to demand that these universities tell us who's involved. I am telling you, Mark, and I'm telling your viewers, President Trump demands a 247 commitment. And Pam Bondi and the entire DOJ's office said, ""How many attorneys do you need?"" They you can have any amount of attorneys and resources. And we are using every resource, every tool to stop it. We're going to make sure, Mark, this goes beyond Trump's administration. We're going to deter this type of hatred towards Jews forever. We're going to eradicate it. And I'm This is my number one commitment. I want people watching, I am sincere. I am committed. This is a job that I love to do to make sure that anti-semitism does not exist in this in the greatest country under the greatest president we have ever had. I think it's so important that you're saying what you're saying and that people understand the commitment of Donald Trump here. I really do because he gets such a bum rap from the media and the Democrats. Let me ask you this, Leo Terrell. How many Democrat leaders in Congress have reached out to you and said, ""We want to help you. Is there anything we can do to help support your effort?"" Has Leticia James reached out to you? Has Hakee Jeff reached out to you? Has Chuck Schumer reached out to you? Have any of these Democrat party bigwigs, have they reached out to you? Let me give you the names of every Democrat who has helped me. Here we go. Mhm. That's the list. That's the list. That's the complete list. And they're not And they're not gone, are they? Mark, they're not going to because the Democrat party adopted a Michigan strategy during the election. They lost. They The Democrat party has turned its back on the Jewish American community. The Jewish American community has a friend in Donald Trump and Pam Bondi and this administration. Now, after the break, you don't want to miss our buddy Steven Miller. There's nobody like him. As he sets the record straight on Trump's economic plan for America's future. We'll be right back. What does the do? What does the sound? What does the bite for Look at the sound. We got to buy Okay, what to Oh, what do the sound? Another cap. We got to do this. Let them off.",0.067,0.774,0.159,1.0
-n4vjHP6RE4,138512,748,0,Ontario town mourns tragic loss of teacher and four students in crash,20250525,"Good evening. A small town in rural Ontario is heavy with grief tonight, mourning the loss of a beloved teacher and four high school students killed in a crash while returning home from an out of town sports event. The fatal collision involved two SUVs and a transport truck. The victims, four teenage girls, ages 16 and 17 and a 33year-old teacher, all were in the same SUV. It happened Friday afternoon on a rural highway near London, Ontario, about 2 hours south of Walkerton, where their school is located. The devastating loss still sinking in. CTV's Scott Miller is in the tight-knit community tonight. Josh Flood quietly stares at the front doors of Walker District Community School. A growing memorial sits outside its front doors. A school that won't feel the same come Monday, says Flood, following the deaths of four of his fellow students and one of his favorite teachers. The four girls, great, amazing, bright students. Everybody loved them. And Ekert, such a great guy. Always had a smile on his face, always knew how to cheer you up. On Friday afternoon around 4:30, an SUV driven by the teacher and carrying four teenage girls collided with a tractor trailer just north of London. All five occupants of the SUV died. They were on their way home to Walkerton from a school softball tournament. In a statement, the Bluewater District School Board said in part, ""This is a devastating loss for the Walker District Community School, the local community, and Bluewater District School Board."" Premier Doug Ford joining the chorus of voices across the province, offering their condolences, posting, ""I'm devastated to hear of last night's tragic accident in Middle Sex County, which has now claimed the lives of five people. My thoughts are with the families and loved ones grieving this terrible loss. The teacher has been identified as Matt Eert, a beloved school coach and assistant coach with the Owens Sound Junior B Northstars lacrosse club. The teacher, Mr. Eert, was very wellliked. He was he's very well known. Um, so it was, like I said, it was just a great big shock um for such a small town. Tim Low is encouraging Walker and residents to place sneakers on their front steps tonight and this coming week to honor the students and teacher who were killed. Put some shoes out, leave the light on, put a, you know, a teddy bear out. Um, let let them know that we care. Let the families know that we care, that we're here for them, that we just we want them to know that we're grieving with them. Walkerton is unfortunately used to dealing with tragedy. The community just marked the 25th anniversary of the E.coli disaster that killed seven residents and sickened 23 others. It's a resilient community. It's going to be um it's going to be very tough though. There's going to be um deep scars from this. A candlelight vigil is planned outside the school Sunday evening at dusk. Counselors will be at the school on Monday to assist students and staff deal with the unimaginable situation. I'm feeling horrible like the death of our teacher and four close great students from our school. It's just such a tragedy. The community is totally in shock and awe from this situation. As the mayor said though, there is a hope that Walkerton, as it has in the past, can pull together and do their best in these unfortunate circumstances.

2N2485zrVtA,197044,7225,0,Meghan Markle's 'Fake Children' & 'Strap On Bump' With Harry | What Just Happened? Kevin O'Sullivan,20250524,"On the occasion of her seventh wedding anniversary, actress Meghan Markle delivered a dazzling display of marital bliss and sent eusive congratulations to her favorite person herself. Incredibly, in the difficult duchess's gushing Instagram post, her hapless husband Harry didn't get a look in. The runaway royal not even mentioned as Bridezilla looked back on the memorable moments since she walked the aisle on May the 19th, 2018. A magical day throughout which the sun shone brilliantly against a cloudless bright blue sky watched by a global audience of more than a billion TV viewers. The picture perfect fairy tale ceremony promised so much. A stunning American star, a dashing British prince, a glittering couple with the world at their feet. A golden future surely lay ahead. What could possibly ever go wrong? Well, one hell of a lot, it turned out. Little did we know that those breathtaking nuptils were the high point. The not so magnificent seven years that have unfolded in in all their lack of glory following that wonderful Windsor spectacular have been downhill all the way. The horror of Megit without a doubt the worst mistake of Harry's mistake strewn life. With old ginger nuts in tow, Megan fleeing Britain under a cloud as the late queen launched an inquiry into her daughter-in-law's bullying of palace staff. The outrageous interview that this preposterous pair of ingrates gave to Oprah Winfrey, falsely accusing the British royals of racism. The deluded duo's pompously overblown plans to become the greatest charity benefactors on earth. How's that working out for them? Megan alienating millions by ruthlessly cutting her loving father, brother, and sister out of her life. Half-wit Harry enraging Americans by dismissing their sacred freedom of speech first amendment as bonkers. Harry's spiteful book spare, lifting the lid on King Charles and his Regal Clan's private details in return for cash. This puffed up prince making a fool of himself at stupid Hollywood gongfests, accepting dafted celebrity awards like the one that hailed him as a legend of aviation. Sure, he bravely flew helicopters in Afghanistan. But does that make him a legend of aviation? Of course it doesn't. Megan's atrocious bullying of staff toiling in the trenches of Monteito as revealed by respected publication the Hollywood Reporter and the Bible of US magazines Vanity Fair. The traumatic stories of the long-suffering minions who quit in their droves and dubbed themselves the Sussex Survivors Club, labeling Megan a tantrumprone tyrant in high heels who reduced grown men to tears. Harry's deranged war with the British press, firing off a blizzard of lawsuits in a crazed conflict he can never win. Oh my god, the list of what's gone pear-shaped for the self-style king and queen of California goes on and on and on right up to just a few weeks back when, against stiff opposition, Harry staged the biggest screw-up of them all. That shocking interview with the BBC when after losing his obsessional legal bid to be given the armed police protection in the UK he neither warrants nor deserves. The demented juke lashed out from the depths of his paranoia at a cruel world he thinks is conspiring against him. Throwing his toys out of the pram like a spoiled brat who didn't get his own way. Along the way disclosing that his dad the king no longer talks to him. Who can blame Charles for that? Meanwhile, wannabe billionaire Megan's venal ambition to monetize her minor royal status gets more embarrassing by the day. Now, with manic Meg desperately flogging obscenely overpriced, thin fruit spread grl and Harry pretty much doing nothing at all, you sense that the gruesome Tusome's rapid descent is far from over. particularly as their relationship seems to be more and more all about her and less and less about him. How Harry hated being the spare in the royal family. The man who would never be king. So what does he feel about being the spare, a sideshow in his own marriage, a bit part playering in the wings while his self-centered wife takes center stage? Now, we learn that the dim juke's minor walk-on role in the first series of Netflix's unwatchable lifestyle show with Love Megan will be reduced to no role at all in the uneagerly awaited second series. Frankly, with this toweringly tedious production lost in widespread apathy, who cares? And as for the Sussex's fabled philanthropy, what ever happened to that? In Time magazine's newly released list of the world's top 100 philanthropists, a certain Duke and Duchess are conspicuous by their absence. But can our hopeless heroes sink any lower?

So, uh, Samara and Andrew, I began that monologue by, uh, talking about, uh, Megan's extraordinary Instagram post about her wonderful seven-year marriage, not even mentioning her husband, a guy called Harry, Megan, in case you've forgotten him. Uh, and on that post was this. Yes. Uh, they call it a mood board. And she has posted her idea of the highlights of this relationship. Uh, and uh, people make a lot of them never showing uh, the faces of their kids. Well, it's here before it was born. I think that one was Archie. What did you make of all this, Samara? I mean, first of all, it's absolutely a cry for help. But it's also an exercise in narcissism to the highest degree. I mean, when I look at this, I just think, go get a life. What are you doing all day? Like crowding around photos and putting them together. And And you're right about Archie. I mean, there are full uh frontal shots of Archie's face right there. Um, we've got his first photo ever. I mean, where is the actual privacy that they've been yapping on about going to courts about and leaving the royal family over? There's none of it. And it's actually um it's really surprising. It's a surprising move from her, but as I said, I I think it's a a move in desperation. Yeah. Uh I mean, she she does do this. No one else congratulated her. Yes. Uh but she did congratulate herself neglecting to mention her other half. I mean this woman narcissism doesn't even begin to cover it. It's an absolute joy isn't it? The sevenyear I wouldn't call it a joy but it's a joy and terribly predicted the seven year it also the seventh anniversary is a copper one and I think it's a bitter reminder. It is a bitter reminder that in the courts very recently just a few days before the one thing that Harry's not getting is any coppers. You work on that basis there's no protection for him. See what I did there? Oh my god, that that was very torturous. But but you got there in the that was the good thing. Um but you mentioned the sevenyear there, Andrew Samara. You know the seven-year itch, this famous moment where happily married couples apparently often reach the point where they go, I can't stand the sight of him or her anymore and they split up. There's a long track record of people who do split up when they hit the sevenyear mark. I mean, I see the signs here. I don't I really really don't see this marriage lasting. Uh it may get past the seven-year itch bit, but the 8year itch. I mean, we were speculating, remember last year, they hadn't been seen together in over 84 days. They had basically split publicly in definitely in a professional sense. And as you said in the monologue, he's not going to be included in the second season. There are lots of different pointers as to say that Harry, as you said, is a massive side piece in Megan's life. And she has a track record for when this person doesn't suit or benefit me, I'm just going to toss you to the wayside. I mean, she's been known to do it before. How can Well, ask her first husband who she dumped by FedEx sent back her wedding and engagement rings by FedEx. He gets this envelope. Had no idea. Oh, looks like my wife's left me and here's the rings that I gave her. Unbelievable. I mean, I mean, she drops people like a stone. Really, really ruthlessly and actually kind of disturbingly people who are like, ""That's almost psychopathic, isn't it?"" It is psychopathic. And, uh, a lot of experts have even weighed in and said, ""Yes, I mean, there are definitely pointers to, you know, how she could be navigating the relationship."" But I also think it goes deeper than that. I think it's about the fact that she's now the provider. Harry doesn't really do anything. He doesn't make the money in the relationship. Uh, he doesn't bring home or any opportunities. She's having to go out and forage for herself and that can also fracture a relationship massively. I mean, I know she wants to be the star of the show, but when he's really when when he's got when he when he's at home watching reruns of Suits, I mean, there's nothing attractive about that. I imagine she does that a lot as well. Oh, look. It's me. It's my favorite person. Oh, look. Look. But we heard heard beforehand actually those rerunner suits trigger him, don't they? because he doesn't like the sex scenes with with with other men. So, I doubt that he's watching that. The other interesting thing about the mood board is about the rumor about her baby bump and the and the the strap-on bump because here is a picture in the womb. The very first picture of Archie, I assume it is. Uh working on that sort of basis to dispel those rumors. But does it? Uh I don't think it does. I mean, you can get a photo like that from anywhere. Yeah. Yeah. But but but you know when I first heard this oh Megan put a strap on on I thought what's going on there. But actually it is we don't know. I mean it is alleged it is alleged that she did put a strap on pregnancy uh on for the pictures. Uh but uh that would confirm this show what just happens policy that Harry and Megan don't actually have any kids. There you go. We were right all along. Right. I mean, I think people do earmarks when after she had Archie, she became really nefarious about media and, you know, Kate always did the right thing and would he she'd go and step in front of the cameras a couple of hours after she'd had the kids sometimes, but they kept Archie really under lock and key for days and then didn't show him and then were doing all these kind of controlled pat. So, of course, that's going to create a lot of speculation as to uh the nature of that pregnancy and then it goes into the royal family. It has to kind of come from her womb in order to be deemed uh basically titles. I Yeah. And and and this relationship as depicted here, I mean, this is a love story. There's pictures of them kissing and cuddling and god knows what, looking blissfully happy. There's an elephant, but it doesn't really it doesn't tell the story of this real relationship, does it? The real story of this relationship as is becoming more and more uncomfortably clear. Yes. is that he is just, you know, her whipping boy. She is he is so subordinate to her. It's excruciating. I mean, you know, and as you say, Samara, the thing is that he's being useful to her. He's got her where she is now. Uh, and I think, Andrew, he may be reaching the point or she's reaching the point where I'm not sure I need this ginger nuts guy anymore. It is a difficult one, isn't it? The one picture which of course is missing is the picture of you because throughout all of this where am I? Exactly. Exactly. You have come on. You have punctuated this relationship. You've be provided narrative every step of the way. Every step of the way. You should be the fridge magnet holding up these pictures. You know, it's interesting you mentioned that though. It is a lot of just them. And what's really starkly uh missing is any family at all apart from I mean, you know, you'd have maybe some family shots in that sort of mood board. maybe a a family dinner for a birthday or something like that and there's none of that. It is very very individual. I mean them against the world. She also she is so so corny and cheesy isn't she? I mean like when she pins her our love story. It is our love story. I mean give me a break. What is this? Mills and bloody boom you know for God's sake. It's a quite terrifying picture of the with her and the elephant. Uh because that's like a it looks like an adult elephant looked really upset about to charge them with a half naked Harry uh down there as well. It's interesting because on the Jamie Kern Lemur podcast, she said to her, ""I feel like I'm in my honeymoon period and this is the honeymoon period for us because the start of our relationship was so tumultuous."" Uh and I think that that's actually the opposite. And she reads every headline. She reads all the stories that people write about her. And I think you know stuff like posting photos of Archie are to quash all those rumors and then them in love that's again to quash those rumors that are coming out about the divorce. Yeah. She reads uh all the stories and watches the YouTube which may explain why I'm not on that right. I do I do I do understand that I'm not on their Christmas card list. I may be high in their list of the people I hate most. But you know it's it's nothing personal Megan or Harry. You know what I mean? just just doing my job, just trying to get the facts. Well, we love it, you know. But, uh, also, as I mentioned in my monologue, uh, what is now overshadowing uh, our love story, their love story is her venal pursuit of wealth, of great wealth. Uh, you know, she's desperate to be a billionaire. As I said, she's desperate to cash in on on her extremely minor royal status. And, uh, it's not going to work. I know this. Uh, we discussed this last week and you guys have got a good take on it as well. When we tried all of that as a product, you know, it's not disgusting. Nobody Nobody's going to go out of their way to buy that stuff. Not at that price. Exactly. And what you brought in was the wonderful Prince William one, wasn't it? Which the strawberry jam, which tasted a lot better. You know what, though? I'm going to tell you the easy way to become a billionaire. She's going to marry probably a hedge fund manager in about 10 years, maybe five. That's the easiest way and that's probably what she'll do because he hasn't got any money. I mean Harry's spent it all on blood. Harry will look terrible after that. You look like you've been dragged through a hedge fund backwards. Uh but uh yeah, I mean he looks he does look very desperate now. He does. I I feel I do feel sorry for him. He does look a bit downtrodden and things like that and and it is the seventh anniversary and you're right. He does seem to be a sort of a side thing to it and uh it would have been he's an appendage. An increasingly uh irrelevant appendage. He's got to find himself a purpose in life. It's it's humiliating for him. It is. I mean it was always very much us verse them for the past I'd say five years since they exited the royal family. You know we are against the royal family. We are against the firm the institution. But now I think they're going to start attacking themselves because they haven't got the royal family to really attack anymore. There's nothing more to there's no more ground to cover. So I think that now they're going to turn inward and start assessing, oh god, what have I signed up for? I think that's what Harry's going to start thinking. It would still be lovely. However, I keep saying this if they could build a bridge with the king. I think it's because however many years he may have and so on and so forth. I I love that idea. I kind of I I kind of like the feud. Uh yeah, of course. Of course. I mean, you know, the thing I think about King Charles, he's a nice guy, you know, he's a nice guy, member of the Magic Circle. He's a bit sppy. He's a bit woke, you know, he's like lost lost in all that green clap trap, but he's a nice enough guy, and I feel sorry for the fact that uh he's given birth to a spoiled brat who treats him very badly and treats treated his grandmother very badly as well. Uh so Harry's story, God knows where it's going. Uh but uh I I I think that the next story, the big story uh unfolding about this too will be financial cuz she ain't going to make much money out of As ever. I think she's probably already made all the money she ever would make out of uh As ever, which is probably about $63. Uh she's going to be a billionaire. With Love, Megan, nobody cares about that. That will flop even worse than the first series. uh Confessions of a Female Founder, an absolute catastrophe, a total flop. So, everything she's doing is not working. There's no money coming in there. And even with his royal connections, uh they've got very, very high prices to pay for their high cost of living, maintaining that mansion. Uh I think the next story about them will be financial, their finances, or lack thereof. Let's go to a bad ad.

[Music] He's mad as hell. It's Kevin O. Sullivan. Welcome back to part two of what just happened. This is the point where we look back on what we think are the biggest stories of the week. Check it. Three, two, one. [Applause] Yeah, it's the big moment. Well, we've got three for you, but uh for me uh the biggest moment cuz it was pure theater was Donald Trump uh meeting South African President Sirill Ramosa in the White House and giving old Sirill the Zalinski treatment. Unbelievable. Let's have a look. Turn the lights down and just put this on. It's right behind you. Johan, there's nothing this parliament can do with or without you. people are going to occupy land. Now, what was happening there was that President Trump Ramaposa had gone there uh in the African way hoping to do trade deals, make some money, you know, uh that's what those African nations like doing uh getting generous deals from Western nations. So, that's what he thought he was doing. He was on a cash hunt. Yes. uh and Donald had other ideas and he ambushed him with this video which was all about the alleged genocide of white farmers uh in South Africa who are being killed for their land. Uh now whether or not that's genocide uh is a moot point. You know genocide as you know Andrea has to be legally defined. Uh but there is uh there's a lot of murdering going on of these farmers and uh Trump showed raphosa poor old sirill this video uh and you know Ramaposa play you know acted like he didn't know what he was talking about he knew full well uh uh and just an astonishing scene. It was quite astonishing and I always say Trump is a master media manipulator. He knows how to get that moment in the same way Zalinsky was planned theatrics. He knew this is the moment. He has the media watching and now's the moment to do it. So, all credit for him to doing that. It's an appalling situation. He called it out in the right way. Yeah. Well, uh we had uh Elon Musk's father, Errol Musk, on our show last night. So, in her other life, Samara is my producer of my show, which is on talk. It's called the political Friday, Monday to Friday, every night 7 to 10. I hungly recommend it. that Samara brilliantly booked uh Errol Mus to come on and talk about it. He of course lives in he does uh South Africa and he said this is a thing he said people are being killed left right and center for their land uh and you know people try to say oh it's not racial black farmers being killed as well is mainly blacks on white it really it's black people killing white farmers you know it's a rebellion I guess against old colonialism but it is not justified and Donald Trump's video showed all these crosses all down the road I mean all down this highway I mean thousands thousands of them that are com are to commemorate the victims of this mass slaughter. It's absolutely appalling. And Errol himself, he he has said that he's had to kill an intruder in his house. Three. Three. Exactly. When when he was and he was trying to protect his young daughter. Death and destruction is all part of life in Africa. Yeah. So Errol M starts saying to me, ""Yeah, well, I've experienced it myself."" My South African very good. Yeah. I've experienced it myself. I thought we were there. South Africa. Uh anyway, uh so I I gradually worked out. Is this guy telling me that he killed three people? So did you kill them? He goes, ""Yes, I did."" Yeah. Yeah. Which, you know, everyone, the audience actually thought, ""Yeah, that's right. He should be defending himself because they vowed to cut his daughter up."" And he was tried for murder. We've unpacked this. He was tried for murder, but they let him off because it was self-defense. and there was a real risk to his child in the house. Yeah. Uh so we we need to move on but a couple of last points. I asked uh why Trump had done this and apparently he's genuinely upset about also he's America first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But he's upset about what's happening in South Africa. They say he's just obsessed with America. He's got a lot of concerns about the rest of the world as well. Uh and the other funny thing, the thing that made me laugh about it in the middle of this was South Africa's most famous golfer Ernie L's. Yeah. And Ratif Gooseen, another South African golfer, both standing there beused as to what they were involved in. But let's move on because in that same uh saga in the Oval Office, which is now becoming the home of TV theater, uh a uh reporter from NBC television suddenly asked Donald Trump about Air Force One. It turns out that America, to my surprise, will be accepting this gift of this massive great goldplated inside. Anyway, uh jumbo jet for the president. Air Force One will officially be a gift from the Qatari nation. Uh this NBC reporter somewhat irrelevantly because they were talking about South Africa asked the president about this and uh Donald uh Tal kind of turned on him. Watch this. We're talking about a lot of other things. This NBC trying to get off the subject of what you just saw. You are a real, you know, you're a terrible reporter. You ought to go back to your studio at NBC because uh Brian Roberts and the people that run that place, they ought to be investigated. They are so terrible the way you run that network. And you're a disgrace. No more questions from you. I said last night, if I had a if I had a pound or a dollar for every time somebody has called me a terrible reporter, I'd be a multi-millionaire. I'll tell you that. Let's uh talk about a domestic story, something that's happened here in Britain that I know Donald Trump has been talking about, has been discussed at the highest levels in Washington and around the world because it's about British freedom. It's a story we discussed last week. Uh it is the grotesqually disproportionate sentence of uh a mom called Lucy Connelly. She's just in her early 40s, I believe. Uh the judge said, ""No, no, no. 31 months is not excessive. Stay exactly where you are, behind bars. You're a barristister."" That's a disgrace. It's an absolute disgrace. And as you say, a stain on uh Britain that we have this situation. Same time Tommy Robinson's being released in the next few days. She should never, this is the point that I made, she should never, ever, ever have pleaded guilty to incitement. That's where the problem started because the judges then have a tariff and they turn around and say, ""Well, you've pleaded guilty to this. This is what we're governed by the sentencing council to do this."" And it's interesting you talk about Donald Trump and gifts. Statue of Liberty was given by France in 1886. One of our fundamental freedoms. There you go. Given by France, nobody says hang about. You're working on that sort of basis. But liberty and the freedom of speech is a fundamental right. What we they the police should be policing our streets, not our tweets. AB: Absolutely. Uh you know the Statue of Liberty, I was so old that uh when I first went up there, you could still climb all the way up the arm and you could see, you know, the the the torch, you could stand on the torch. How good is that? Absolutely terrifying. But you could see down the the vast interior of that stat statue. And of course on the arm, you're it's going like that. It is. Uh but your thoughts on what happened to Lucy Connelly? It's an absolute outrage, isn't it? It is an outrage. And you know what? We talk about optics. Starmmer saying that he knows nothing about the case was probably one of the worst things I've ever watched. I mean, that is a prime minister who is completely unable. I'll preempt that by explaining. When our prime minister was quizzed about the failure of Lucy Conny's appeal against her sentence, we all thought she was going to get released. Everybody in this country has been talking about it. It's been all over the TV, all over the radio, all over the front pages of the paper. And when our prime minister totist enemy of free speech uh was asked about it, he goes, ""I'm I'm not across the details of that case."" A lie. A lie. It's ridiculous. Another lie to add to his sort of massive amount that's piling up. I just think that it's given us a really, really bad look, especially with the US. We had this very uh influential commentator called Charlie Kirk come to the UK this week and he has millions of followers and he has been tweeting that he said he was kissing the ground when he got back to the US because of because it to free America. Yeah. This place this place Britain Star's turning it into starsy Britain. It's like East Germany in the 1970s or something or South Korea. This guy is a really really dangerous prime minister. uh an enemy of British freedom. We're all very worried here. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Uh I'm going to get uh one of the mood board. I'm going to get mood board. Bad mood board. Which brings me nicely to a bad ad. Hey. Wow. That's incredible. This is the first time I've ever used this product. I saw it on the uh infomercials and I was skeptical at first. Um but uh it it works. I tell you what, I can't believe it. You know, I've seen the commercial and I I I just couldn't believe it. And it really looks great. My wife's got herself a new guy now. And I tell you, I'm really impressed. That's incredible. I've been getting arousing for being bald. I'm only a young man. No more dates without being called old man. But the babes are back. The babes are back. Yeah, I can I can confirm it really does work well. I love it. That products have been around for years. It's an old show business. It's TV industry uh sort of prop uh that spilled out into the commercial world. Somebody in TV said, ""Well, we could sell this generally."" So, they do. That's the story of that. And as I say, it works very well. Beautiful. Right. Let's go to some real ads. [Music] What just happened? [Music] He's mad as hell. It's Kevin O. Sullivan. Welcome back to part three of what just happened. By the way, this is really my hair. I don't usually don't really use that product. He lied. No, it is my hair. Why am I having an argument with myself? It's time for viewers questions. Uh well, Samara, ask me some questions. Sure. Uh school kids are being taught that black people built Stonehenge. What do you think? I don't think they did. Yeah. I mean, this is a worrying thing here in Britain. You know, uh, we are still President Trump brilliantly cancelled woke on day one of his forthright presidency. Uh, cancel all that DEI clap trap. Cancel wokery. Uh, and it is a remarkable thing to see over here in Britain. We watched it with tears in our eyes. Why can't we have that? Why can't we have that? Well, we can't. We have a generation of very woke teachers uh, who are brainwashing our children with non-history. And apparently they are teaching our kids that uh people of color, black people built Stonehedge, you know, our ancient monument uh in the middle of Ssbury plane here in South South Britain. Now uh the thing is we don't really know who built aliens there. There is talk that it could have been uh distant people of color, but we don't know. So telling kids that this is a fact is symptomatic of the misinformation that these left-wing teachers are brainwashing our children with. And do you know uh for the British viewers uh this will be a shock to you. Uh American viewers probably won't care nor the Australians. Australians might be interesting but seriously the two great battles of British history are of course Waterloo and Trfalga. Yes. Waterloo on ground on the earth. Trfalga at sea. our great British victories, our great British fat. I love Hastings. Uh, no, no, don't mind that. They've been taught the banners. Thanks very much, Samara. That's completely ruined my fantastic diet. Uh, that so Hastings. Anyway, that that's not a glorious B. We lost that one. For God's sake, back to Australia with you. Can you can you get out of the studio, please? No, seriously. Seriously. So, these two great battles that we actually won. Yes, we do usually win our wars. Uh, Trfalga and Waterloo. Do you know that only one in 10 British schools are teaching our kids? Isn't that crazy? Nine out of 10 schools don't teach British kids about our two most legendary famous victories. All they teach is 1066 and all that, isn't it? You're working on that sort of basis. What's also crazy? Exactly. I didn't go to a British school. There you go. Yeah. Well, you might You knew that we lost that one. Exactly. Don't bring up the the last thing. What's also crazy, you might remember when Gemini came out, the the equivalent of of that sort of stuff. That was all woke and that rewrote history. It had the black founding fathers. It had a black pope and so on and so forth. It basically was too woke. History is ugly, but there's no need to rewrite it. Well, you mustn't rewrite it. It mustn't teach kids wrong facts. I was going to make some sort of joke about Australia never winning a war or something like that, but no, I want to be serious here. Uh the ANZACs were so uh important to the British in the Second World War. So were the Americans. This was uh this was a sort of alliance with the good guys. So here's to Australia. Seriously, we only learned about our the white history actually. They actually said that to us. We're not teaching the other stuff. You don't you don't get taught that any the heroes. No, we get taught that, but we only get taught that. We don't get taught anything else about the indigenous population. Yeah. You haven't got taught that Britain lost the battle of Hastings, did you? I did. That's why I brought it on just to anyway. I thank you. Hings blood in the eye for you. Absolutely. Go. Anyway, how else have we got to ruin the show? What have we got now? Next question. Has dried Britain back into the EU with a disastrous deal. Why does he hate us? Well, it's an interesting thing, is it? This guy uh this is our prime minister. He's a he's the ultimate globalist. He uh his first thought is for Europe. Uh we in Britain voted to leave that sclerotic useless organization, the European Union back in 2016. Ever since then uh millions of our politicians have been trying to reverse that vote uh to no avail. Uh now uh we've made the mistake of voting this shapeshifting liar Karma into power. He's getting us back into the EU by stealth. He's just signed a deal uh whereby once again we're going to have to give Brussels billions of pounds for the privilege of accepting their millions of rules and regulations. Uh we've gone back, we've rejoined in all but name, haven't we, Samara? I mean it's anti-democratic actually because 17.4 million people voted to leave the EU. Karma has betrayed them. Absolutely. And what happened is Boris got elected on get Brexit done and that Kia Star is getting Brexit undone. is an absolute scandal. Those in the fishing industry are all crying out saying, ""What are you going to do? You're going to this industry as a result of what you've done."" Uh, and it's scandalous. Absolutely scandalous. He resembles all that's wrong with the left and your Alistister Campbell and all your people that wanted to stay and and had all these campaigns which Stal was also a part of. Uh, they think their idea is correct and that's all we should go for. But it's also an undemocratic people elected. Whatever people views are, democracy said we're leaving. Yeah. He Yeah. You know, he calls it his he's thrilled. I got a Brexit reset. Well, we didn't ask you to do a Brexit reset. We don't want a Brexit reset. We don't want a closer relationship with Europe. We hate the Europeans. There you go. 1066 all that. That was that was a bit that was a bit of a joke. Actually, let me let me just explain that. We we sort of hate the concept of Europe. We hate, you know, we we we in theory we conceptually we hate the French, but actually we actually like each other in person. I love Europe. I love going to Europe. Love going to France, but I also like conceptually hating them and they like hating us as well. That's the way neighbors always dislike. But we're an island and as an island, we treasure island strangers. What's your next question? The UK has crashed out of Eurovision speaking up with zero points again from the public. Should we stop paying for it? Uh well, you know, you don't have to pay for it, but Britain is one of the or Britain, the UK is one of the countries uh that pays a lot of money to avoid the semifinals. So, we uh go straight into the finals and that the BBC I think I think it's it's a lot of money. It's like 121 12 million pounds or something. Uh but it it is one of the biggest shows on the be all year gets watched by millions of people. Uh but this year's Eurovvision was an anti-Semitic disgrace. Uh a very brave young girl called uh you Raphael. Yes. I seem to remember. Uh she's the Israeli singer uh contestant and she survived that Nova festival on October the 7th. Yes. By burying herself in the corpses, the dead bodies of her friends and acting dead, playing dead. She bravely became Israel's singer, Israel's uh contestant. And when she hit the stage, uh she was drowned out by a a cacophony of booze and jeers. Uh some pro Palestinian protesters, shamefully from Britain, tried to storm the stage, chucked paint at her. Uh and uh if it's going to be like that, then you can stick your revision where the sun don't shine. That was disgusting. Uh it shouldn't be like that. So uh should we stop paying for it? I think it should be stopped altogether if it's going to be like that. Uh and by the way uh while Britain useless Britain once again our girl group what they call remember Monday and and and their song by the way they're still hearing from my lawyers. Guess what their song was called? What the hell just happened? Exactly. We're going to sue them. But anyway, they came 19th out of 26. They got no public votes whatsoever. nil points and uh Israel brilliantly while all the countries tried to vote them down the public voted them to the top of the list. The public made them the biggest point scorers out of all the nations. So the public around the voting nations they stand with Israel and the organizers of Eurovvision hated that and interesting the UK gave their dua 12 points to Israel worked on that sort of basis. The one thing they should have done though is praise the songwriters. There was not a single mention of songwriters in the whole competition. Yeah. Well, did you hear the songs? I mean, what? Sorry. What? Bing bing bang bing bing bing. Very good actually. I wrote that one. Thank you. In terms of the anti-semitism, what do the Euro Vision supporters want? Do they want next year? Do they want it to be hosted in Gaza? Because they see there's a row going on incredibly incredibly uh from their depths of their anti-Israel uh outlook. uh Belgium and Spain have lodged an official complaint saying that the uh tidal waves of of public votes for Israel must have been a fix and they want they say the votes were rigged. I say that if there was any vote fixing and I wouldn't put it past that long. It was to make sure that Israel did not win. Graham Norton, the British host here, he said you could sense the palpable sense of relief uh that next year's contest would now because Israel were narrowly pipped to the post by Austria would not have to be held in Tel Aviv, which was a strange strange thing. It was a strange thing because it would probably have been in Jerusalem. Oh, no. Absolutely. And and what's crazy is that this was supposed to transcend all sorts of politics. It's supposed to be using music to unite. It's the common language. It's all about love and everything else. You get people to work on that basis. The fact it was a scandal. Whatever you thought of the British song, uh actually it deserved more than zero points. There was clearly clearly a political move on that sort of basis and it was scandalous. Yeah, they I mean nobody likes Britain. Uh and that's why we always do very very badly. Uh I disagree with you. I thought that the song deserved I thought nil points was quite generous. Uh was over generous. Terrible song. Uh Andrew Lloyd Weber thinks that remember Monday are the next big thing. Yeah, that pain for Andrew member may be a bit over the hill. I don't think so, Andy. I really don't think so. Uh, should we go to a bad ad? Has this ever happened to you? What a mess. What about this for a carpet design? Trails, tracks, spills, stains. This carpet has had it. But wait, introducing No Wet Wonder Foam, the miracle carpet cleaner from the makers of DD7. No wet wonder foam is a scientific breakthrough that lets you clean any carpet quickly, totally, and without wetting. I'll guarantee you that doesn't work. I'll guarantee I know about carpet cleaners. My wife and I, Henrietta and I, we we constantly buy those products because we got an old dog, you know, and uh, you know, he makes a bit of a mess with the carpet quite often. It's really annoying. So, we go, ""Oh, this one looks brilliant."" They never ever work. They should they should what they should do they should combine it with the spray on hair cuz that first stuff it just it was it does work on So what we actually do is we replace the carpets about once every six There you go. So we keep our carpets clean but it cost us about £20,000 a year. Let's go to a real break. [Music] What just happened? [Music] He's mad as hell. It's Kevin O. Sullivan. Welcome back to part four, the final section of this fantastic show. What just happened? Now, it's the complaints department where we go through some of the messages. Thousands of messages you're kind enough to send us. We do appreciate it. But first, could it be magic? Yes, I'm afraid it could be. It's another trick uh from broadcaster, barrista, magician Andrew Eel. Take it away. Thank you. Think of one of your favorite movies throughout the rest of your life. Okay. Okay. Think about you got you got a movie. Yeah. Okay. Fantastic. Kevin, it's Kevin got some crowns here with a color. What do I do? Do you have a favorite color? What's your favorite color? Do you want me to say? Yeah. Out of these. You got any color at all? You can pick. You got green, you got red, you got black. What? What do you want? Say black. Black. Okay. So, black. We're going to over here like this. Well, it sort of is. Let's get these over here like this. So, what I want you to do, Samara, hold out your hand. Hold your hand and close it over there like that. And I want you to think of your movie. Are you thinking of your movie? Yes. Okay. Now, watch carefully. Uh can you think of a color? Uh you can think of a character which is that color. Yeah. You have? Okay. What What's the What's the character? Uh Darth Vader. What's the movie? It's Star Wars. Star Wars. Let's have a open up your hand. Have a look like that. And just have a look over here like this. Yeah. If you have a look over there like that, if we can get a closeup on this one, that molded in here is in fact I'm holding on to that. No. How did you do that? That is Darth Vader. But it doesn't just hold on to that one. It doesn't end there because nice and quickly inside the bag. Have a look cuz this was a prediction. You could have picked any movie of all the movies we have. We have the little a little hits over here like this. We've got there is a little Yoda in a pot over there like that. Yoda inside here. Give it a little blow tomorrow. That's trending at the moment. There you go. There's your lightsaber. That's magic. What just happened? Amazing. Amazing. Incredible. So, your favorite film was Star Wars. Yeah, very You said that was controversial. Why is that controversial? I mean, I used to be a film critic. I've never seen Star Wars. It's true. You've never seen it? Never seen it. No. Uh, right. Let's get to the complaints department. Isabelle says, ""Samara, stuff you in stark contrast and stop interrupting people. You are not that interesting."" True. Actually, Samara never interrupts anybody. That's my job. I'm I'm the one who does that. Go ahead. Whatever you think about Megan's brand, I think Samara's reaction was over dramatic and quite frankly rather silly and stupid. Yeah. Do it again. Uh I think that's written by my mom cuz she was doing the same thing. If you remember, the annoying part of it was I baked those bloody cookies. Yeah, exactly. Uh and you know, she gags on them. I mean, it's not very complimentary to me, was it? Uh and uh that's a terrible crime on this show. What you got next, Samara? Uh Lee Hogan says, ""Love Samara and her realness. She's such a compliment to Kevin's hilarious but bit a bit brash at times personality."" A bit brash brash. Come on. Uh, next Joy got on. Uh, 1569, a fine year. No, Kev. Palace PR team did a good job hiding Petulant Harry's obnoxious nature. He's always been a pain in the ass. It took MM to bring it to the four. You see, that is a really interesting point. You know, they say always been ruined by Megan, and I he's certainly been made a lot worse. She has ruined him. Uh, but uh I suspect he was never perhaps the the nicest guy in town. And you're right, his image was polished by the royal PR machine. Next, Samar. So true. Um, SLS says, ""Poor Kevin. His lack of knowledge of what's going on in the US is sad. Trump wants a law passed saying that even if you are born in the US, it does not automatically make you a US citizen. Uh, his Republican party is nuts and Trump is the issue."" Well, what's wrong with that law? What's wrong with that law? I why does that mean I don't know about what's going on in America? I mean, you you might not like that law, but what Trump is talking about is, you know, it's almost being used as a device by a lot of migrants. They they come on over, they have a kid, that kid, because it's born in America, becomes an automatic American citizen, and then they get their citizenship and Trump is trying to stop that syndrome. Uh, you know, I would have thought it's not a bad idea. Uh, next. Um, so Harry and Megan are horren abusers, liars, slanderous losers. Uh, there will never be a reconciliation with either family and justifiably so, says any in the world. I think that's right, Ellen. Uh, that uh, for better or for worse, those family feuds, Megan's with her dad, her brother, and her sister, and Harry, uh, with his entire family over here in Britain, I don't see them ever getting healed. I don't see uh the king or prince Harry ever talking to each other again. I think that the king, you know, there's that thing in families, you know, you sort of love your relatives. You don't necessarily like them. You get born with them. I think the king has come to the point where he just doesn't like Harry much. Uh and William certainly doesn't. Next, Samara. Uh so Narell has said, ""Oh my gosh, I really love Samara. She's so authentic as a fellow Aussie. She is as blunt and to the point as the rest of us. I love it. Great show, Kevin. Thank you. Oh, that's sweet. Do you send these in? So much praise for Samaris. I know what I'm doing next week. I'm going to send some in about me. Kevin's so brilliant. What you got, Andy? Really crazy, says Jax 3992. It was like watching the QVC channel selling MM's products. Some people will watch this and actually buy her products, good or bad. It just makes it more real for them. You are all just helping to sell MM's products. I don't get it. Well, uh, what was that person? That was some Jacks. A 399 jacks. Uh, we won't have helped to sell the products. Uh, nobody will help to sell those products. As I keep saying, having tried them, people will buy them first time round. Maybe for the novelty value, uh, see what it's like. But they're so expensive. The jam as or the fruit spread as we discovered. Nah. Cookies, you know. And these are coming in at $14. The honey is like $28, isn't it? Who's going to pay that twice? It's just not going to happen. As ever, isn't going to last forever. I'll tell you that. Uh, go on, Samara. Elizabeth Compton says, ""Kevin, let Simple Simon come back just one last time. Andrew can use a magic trick on him and make him disappear the rest of his time."" I hope. Hey, Presto. London, you're gone. Uh, yeah, that's a good idea. But maybe we'll get Simon back. Well, we got all of us at one time for a laugh. Uh, and uh, Betty Bob G5C says Betty Bob G5C. Yeah, you know the one as opposed to four set 4D. Actually, I hope the Marles aren't recording any conversations material for another book. Uh, yeah. Well, they probably are. There is serious talk that Harry is planning a second book spare. As I say, if he does write a second book, it won't be spare to the royal family, spare to the heir to the throne. It'll be spare to Megan. How I gave my life up and ruined it by marrying Megan. Spare too with Prince Harry. Uh, next Samar. Uh, Judy Ammy says, ""If people don't like what you're saying, Kevin, then they shouldn't watch. I'm personally a huge fan. I love your guests. They are so much fun. And I also watch you and Kinsey, and I love that, too."" You're very honest, and you say what you think. The last time I checked, you still have freedom of speech in the UK, although it's getting really scary. Keep bringing us your entertaining news and opinions. Who was that again? That's from Judy. Well, Judy, thanks very much. Uh, yes, I do tend to speak my mind. It's got me in a lot of trouble over the years, but what can you do? Uh, let's go to a bad ad. Let me tell you about a way I found to tighten up my stomach without the torture of doing sit-ups. It's called Easy Crunch. Easy Crunch is the fast, easy way to target all three abdominal muscle groups right in your own home. The forward crunch works the upper abdominals. Kneeins let you target that lower tummy bulge. For people who need to rehearse sex, uh, unbelievable. Unbelievable. And on that sex bombshell, that's the end of this fantastic edition of what just happened. Thank you as always to our master magician Andrew Ebornne and to the brilliant Samar Gil. Thank you all for watching. We'll be back next week with another edition. What just happened? You better be there. [Music]",0.101,0.764,0.135,0.9999
pBQFm-eC77w,119566,8417,0,Trump's Biggest Wins This Month and What's About to Happen Next?,20250525,"It's Memorial Day weekend. There's good news if you're traveling anywhere this weekend. More good news. Gas price lowest this weekend on Memorial Day weekend since it's that it's been since 2003. Now, you might say, ""But Glenn, it's $3 a gallon."" Yes, but I remember it was less than $3 a gallon in 2003. And you'd be right. It was a $153. However, the slight caveat on the happy part is your dollar uh your dollar has lost about half its value. So, uh a $153 what you could buy in 2003 for $153 now costs $3. So, you know, but but just remember it's the lowest that it has been. So, that is good news. The inflation thing might be a problem we should work on. We should work on really. How do you stop something like that? Is there a path to maybe try to reduce inflation over a long period of time? Um, you stop spending so much money uh and you don't print money. Huh. Or borrow money like that. Yeah. What if instead we try to get like $50 trillion in in debt? Would that be another path to success? What is your goal? I was hoping to lower inflation. Is that would that work? No, that would not work. Not I just wanted to make sure that you weren't one of the Marxist radicals that were like I collapse the system because that would work. That would work for work. Yeah, that would Yeah, it would work for that. Uh let me give you some uh some more good news here. Um let's see. Uh the former candidate who threatened to hire a Russian Ukrainian hit squad to kill Anna Paulina Luna going to jail. In prison in prison. So yeah, we got that going for us. There's some good news. Law enforcement is beginning to work. Uh Supreme Court has sided with judge on uh or sided with Trump on the firing of officials from independent federal agencies. So, uh, he can remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to very narrow exemptions. Uh, a Trump judge has also killed Biden's requirement that employers accommodate workers efforts to abort their own unborn children. You know what? I can't come in tomorrow uh early um because I'm going to take the abortion pill and I might be hemorrhaging almost to death on my bathroom floor. Um but they assure me that it's completely safe. So, but you still have to pay me for that. Um no, no, you don't have to do that. You don't have to do that. Not every host can work in the story of someone hemorrhaging uh after a failed abortion into the good news segment of the program, but you did it. That's right. I did. I did it. Thank you. Thank you for recognition on this, dude. Thank you. Finally, somebody sees the talent that I have. And there you have it. Another example of why Glenn Beck is in the radio hall of fame. Thank you.

That is a huge defeat for climate activists and I weep for them. Uh while we're there with the EPA, I don't know if you saw Zeldon testifying in front of Congress, u but uh oh my gosh, it was it was it was almost conservative porn. I like Lee Zeldon a lot. Um and uh one Senate Democrat coming after him and Zeldon turned and said, ""You know, the American taxpayers, they put President Trump in office because of people like you."" Because what he was saying is we're cutting the budget of the EPA because there's waste, there's fraud, and there's corruption. And he decided uh they decided they didn't like that. They didn't like that. And so, uh, White House, Senator Sheldon White House from Rhode Island, um, he's looking at and he says, ""Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You are lying about the waste, fraud, and abuse."" And he said, ""No, no, Senator. I I'm not. Uh, we're just not going to waste dollars because you insist on EPA uh the EPA lighting taxpayer dollars on fire. We're not going to do it."" Um, and he and he came back, he said, ""You don't you don't even know. You you have nothing. You you can't even tell me any of these cuts."" He's like, ""I you know, I could go through all of them. I'm I'm I'm prepared to go through all of them."" Uh, and that's when Ed Marky, another super superhero from Massachusetts, he said, ""Well, provide that list. Provide the list of waste, fraud, and abuse."" And then Zeldon said, ""Okay, well, let's start here. provide the list. And he's like, I got it. I let me just, as soon as he starts, he interrupts him. And then he's like, Zeldon just keeps talking and he and and uh and Marky says, ""I I I reclaim my time. I I I call my time back."" He says, ""They had no"" And Zeldon said, ""You don't want me to go through the list of all the evidence of waste and abuse. You don't care about the conflicts of interest. You don't care about all of the unqualified recipients. Every time Every time I start to give it, I'm happy to go through the list, but you declare there's no evidence, but you don't want me to even go through the list. Every time I talk, you talk over me. Um the the Democrats are just I mean, they are really floundering, by the way. And um and maybe we're going to see some more justice here. Act Blue officials, they have been uh they have been asked to come to testify in front of Congress and uh because Congress is doing a foreign donations probe. Now, Stu, foreign donations, that would be like if um that'd be like if Trump was being funded by the Russians. That's a pretty big deal, right? I remember that being a really big deal. Sure. Yeah. He's getting money from foreign governments. He's on the take from foreign governments. And then, you know, of course, we had Biden who was taking all kinds of cash from several foreign governments. Maybe it's only if you have one foreign government giving you money. I'm not sure. Um, but they made a really big deal about that with Trump. Nothing about Biden. Uh, and now the act blue people are refusing to testify and Congress is like, ""That's fine. We'll subpoena you."" So, there might be some people going to jail there. I'm telling you, handcuffs are coming. Handcuffs are coming over the next couple of months. I think we're going to see lots of handcuffs coming out. We're going to see handcuffs on the people of um COVID, the COVID fraud, the cover up. That's what's going to happen. It's the cover up. It's not about the vaccine. It's not Fouchy. It's going to be the people that knew that there were really dangerous side effects and then tried to cover that up and keep that out of the press and keep people from knowing about those side effects. Um, and those people, you're going to see them in handcuffs, I think, very very soon. Um, the the uh church, and it'll it won't be just political people. Um, a church and 20 people have been charged in a $60 million Medicaid scam. Um the AG um from Arizona has accused the Happy House Behavioral Health LLC. The Happy House Behavioral Health LLC. Well, to me, the first phrase that pops into my mind is uh would you like rub down at Happy House? Oh, no. I'm I'm just saying. I'm It's what comes to mind. Anyway, um they uh they took taxpayer funds for services it either it neither, you know, provided or only partially delivered. Um and then they were billing uh for services for clients who were deceased or in prison. So they couldn't uh they couldn't have given them those services. I guess no rubdowns in uh prison. It's always sad when you have that situation when you lose the rubdowns. in prison. It's It's always very very sad, you know. Uh John Deere is uh is deciding, you know what, maybe we should be a little more American because after all, we are John Deere. Uh John Deere, who is if memory serves me correctly, uh kind of a radical out of step with the Heartland of America, uh kind of company. Um but uh they yeah they've seen the light. They've seen the light. Uh they are going to invest $20 billion in US operations over the next 10 years. So that's couple billion dollars they're pouring into our uh manufacturing and job creation and our local communities. So congratulations John Deere for stepping to the plate. Uh the federal uh there's a federal probe now with media matters. That makes me sad. Oh no wait. I'm sorry. just the opposite. Makes me happy. Um the Congress is now looking in the feds, I'm sorry, not just Congress, uh but federal regulators are now looking into media matters over their plot to defund Musk's ex and silence dissenting voices. Now, that's something new. I've not heard of media matters trying to uh silence voices that uh are are voices of disscent. Have you heard that, Stu, about them? I uh No. Well, gosh. I mean, they just seem like such a I mean, what they're doing is monitoring the media to make sure, you know, No, that's right. Conservative media, which, as you know, controls the entire ecosphere of of of media and make sure they held them hold them accountable because that's that's what they do, Glenn. Also, they just take a bunch of money from their donors and light it on fire. That's the other thing they do. Uh, yeah, they do. They're they're so they're just such wonderful people. Uh the US Mint now is uh following through on the death of the penny. Uh the last order for pennies uh has just been given and so they're stopped producing metal pennies. Now now I just I just want to ask are we doing cardboard penny? Why is it phrased that way that we've produced we're no longer producing metal pennies? I think it's to to allow for the fact that we will still calculate pennies in digital form um going forward. So it's not like every we're just rounding up to the nearest 5 cents. Right. Right. But like no not not that's in a in a um retail transaction. That's supposedly what's going to happen when we run out of pennies. So you go to 7-Eleven, you buy something, it's 2.89, you pay 290. Um so that's what's going to happen. But if if you're send if I'm sending you a Venmo, I can still send you $2.89, right? Like so digitally I can Yeah. So my digital Wow. Wouldn't it be great if we had a central bank digital currency? It would make all these penny things so much easier. Uh so digitally you can use pennies but not in actual cash transactions. Yeah. one that once they run out they're they're doing that thing that some companies do where they'll just saying like we're not firing everybody. We're just not h we're replacing anyone who retires. That's kind of the concept with the penny thing. So they're just going to let them kind of run out of existence but they'll still I mean obviously there's a lot of them out there. So there'll still be transactions for a long time. So I don't know if this is waste. I mean that Donald Trump he's lying about waste all the time. Uh 10 years ago, the penny production uh to produce one penny, it was 1.3 cents. So it cost us a third of a penny more than the penny was worth to make the penny. Um and uh but don't worry about it. Um you know, since the pandemic, it's just up now to 369. So 3 cents. Uh wow. How would you say that? 3.69 69 cents, right? Yeah. I mean, over three times or about three times as much as Yeah. as they're as they actually are worth it takes to produce them. By the way, also the other part of that is it's actually cheaper to produce a dollar than it is to produce a penny, which is perfectly sensible. Isn't that amazing? Because think of the technology that goes into dollars. I mean, it's just it's cotton. It's got stuff woven into it. It has holograms. It has watermarks. Think of what I mean that that's amazing. You can produce that for less than 3 cents. Yeah. Something like it's like 1.4 cents or something for a dollar. Wow. Which is so it's much much cheaper than producing a penny. So Trump uh the DOJ has just dismissed bina lawsuits against Minneapolis Louisville uh the police department there. Um, Trump has escalated the war against Harvard. Uh, you know, Harvard just loves their DEI programs. Uh, and, uh, gosh darn it, we just, we have to be anti-racist. And you know what, maybe a little, uh, pro Palestin Palestinians, you know, free Palestine. Free Palestine. Um, so they're shutting down the visas uh, to Harvard for any international students, which uh, is interesting. And Harvard is like, ""Oh, we're going to fight this."" Well, go ahead. Go ahead. But uh you're going to lose all those foreign students during the fight. Unless we could find an activist judge. I wonder if we could do that.",0.101,0.776,0.123,0.9957

WELCOME, GENTLEMEN. HOUSE REPUBLICANS MANAGED TO PASS THEIR VERSION OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA, A MASSIVE BILL PASSED BY ONE VOTE. IT EXTENDS THE TRUMP TAX CUTS TO PAY FOR THEM IT CUTS MEDICAID, SLASHES FOOD STAMPS AND ROLES BACK THE BIDEN CLEAN ENERGY AGENDA. >> NANCY PELOSI WAS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND SHE HAD TWO FAVORITE THINGS IN ONE WAS LINCOLN AND THE OTHER WAS -- SHOW ME YOUR BUDGET AND I'LL SHOW YOU YOUR PRIORITY. REPUBLICANS ARE HELL-BENT ON FINANCING TAX CUTS FOR THE UPPER THINK, EXPENSE OF MIDDLE-CLASS, WORKING-CLASS AND POOR AMERICANS. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT REPUBLICANS, HOUSE REPUBLICANS, ARE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS. IF YOU LOOK ON THE SENATE SIDE, I SAW A CLIP OF RON JOHNSON FROM WISCONSIN, NO LIBERAL AT ALL RAILING AGAINST THE IMPACTS OF WHAT THE HOUSE PASSED. GEOFF: AND THE MEDICAID CUTS AND PARTICULAR. TRICKY POLITICS FOR REPUBLICANS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MORE PEOPLE ON MEDICAID. OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS MEDICAID ENROLLMENT HAS RISEN TO RECORD HIGH. >> AND A LOT OF THE HOSPITALS DEMAND THAT AND IF THEY SHUT DOWN THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF OPTIONS. I WAS THINKING OF WARREN G. HARDING AND CALVIN COOLIDGE AS I OFTEN DO -- THEY WERE LIKE 100 YEARS AGO AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STOOD FOR FISCAL DISCIPLINE. IT WAS IN THEIR BONES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TOO FAR TO GET TO THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT. AND THIS BILL WILL ADD TO THE DEFICIT BOARD OF THE NATIONAL DEBT BY $3 TRILLION, $4 TRILLION, MIND-BOGGLING. WE ARE ALREADY IN A MOMENT WHERE WE ARE PAYING MORE TO THE BONDHOLDERS AND THE ENTIRE DEFENSE BUDGET. YOU CAN RUN DEFICITS WHEN YOUR INTEREST RATES ARE ZERO BUT WHEN THEY GET HIGHER, IT GETS RUINOUSLY EXPENSIVE. AND THEN WHEN YOUR INTEREST RATES ARE ABOVE YOUR GROWTH RATES, THAT IS A RECIPE FOR A NATIONAL DECLINE BECAUSE YOU ARE BUILDING UP DEBT AND COST FASTER THAN YOUR COUNTRY IS GENERATING WEALTH. WE ARE AT A MOMENT OF TRUE NATIONAL PERIL. NATIONS DECLINE BECAUSE THEY GET BURIED IN THEIR OWN DATA. IT IS MIND-BOGGLING TO ME THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF WARREN G. HARDING AND CALVIN COOLIDGE ARE ACTING LIKE THIS. GEOFF: IS DURING OPENING HERE FOR DEMOCRATS ESPECIALLY ON THE MEDICAID CUTS? THAT IS HOW THEY WON BACK THE HOUSE. >> IT WOULD BE MALPRACTICE IF DEMOCRATS WERE NOT ALREADY RUNNING AGAINST REPUBLICANS, VULNERABLE REPUBLICANS. THIS -- THE PRESIDENT AND THE SPEAKER MADE VULNERABLE REPUBLICANS CAST A BAD VOTE FOR A BILL PASSED THE HOUSE, IT WILL GO TO THE SUN AND COME BACK TO THEM COMPLETELY UNRECOGNIZABLE GIVING DEMOCRATS ALL THE MATERIAL THEY NEED TO HAMMER AWAY AT THOSE HOUSE REPUBLICANS. I'M BEING SPECIFIC -- HOUSE REPUBLICANS. THE SENATE REPUBLICANS, SOME I HAVE BEEN WATCHING, ARE CLOSER TO THE HARDING REPUBLICANS. GEOFF: LET'S SHIFT OUR FOCUS AND TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S FIGHT WITH HARVARD UNIVERSITY. YESTERDAY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BLOCK TO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS FROM ATTENDING HARVARD. THE SCHOOL FILED A FEDERAL LAWSUIT ACCUSING THE ADMINISTRATION OF SETTING A -- IT IS TRYING TO HIT HARVARD WHERE IT HURTS BECAUSE FOREIGN STUDENTS TYPICALLY PAY FULL FREIGHT AND THAT SUBSIDIZES THOUGH TWITCH AND OF AMERICAN STUDENTS. IT IS TRYING TO GO AFTER THE ABILITY OF HARVARD OPERATE. >> IT IS IN A SENSE OUT OF SPITE TO DESTROY HARVARD. I USED TO GO TO HARVARD SQUARE, THE COOP, AND THERE WAS A SECTION WHERE THE HARVARD FACULTY HAD THEIR BOOKS. I WAS THRILLED IN THE SECTION LIKE SAM HUNTINGTON AND ALL THESE LEGENDARY SCHOLARS. AND YOU THINK HARVARD IS THE GREATEST UNIVERSITY EVER. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, THAT SECTION OF THE BOOKSTORE HAS GOTTEN MORE BORING. THERE IS A SMOTHERING EFFECT ON THE INTELLECTUAL VIBRANCY. I HAVE MY CRITICISM OF HARBOR BUT IT IS STILL ONE OF THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THEY DO AMAZING RESEARCH. YOU HAVE TO UPHOLD A BELIEF THAT THE PLACE HAS SERIOUS FLAWS ON ANTISEMITISM AND EXCESSIVE PROGRESSIVISM BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT IS NOT ONE OF OUR MOST WONDERFUL AND VALUABLE INSTITUTIONS AND YOU ARE DESTROYING A LARGE PART OF AMERICAN WEALTH CREATION. AND THESE ARE THE KINDS OF DISTINCTIONS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CANNOT MAKE. IT IS LIKE YOU GO TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AS IF IT IS A DOCTOR AND SAY, I HAVE ACNE AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYS, OK WE WILL HAVE A DECAPITATION AND THAT IS CARE. GEOFF: DESPITE -- THUS SPITE COMBINES IMMIGRATION AND CULTURE WARS. HOW DO YOU SEE IT PLAYING OUT? >> THE THING THAT I APPRECIATE MOST ABOUT THIS IS THAT HARVARD IS NOT BACKING DOWN. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE PRESIDENT IS GOING AFTER HARVARD IS BECAUSE HARVARD HAS THE TEMERITY TO SAY NO ONE THE LETTER CAME WITH THE DEMANDS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION LATER SAID WAS ACCIDENTALLY SENT TO HARVARD. HARVARD SAID, WE ARE NOT DOING THIS AND CONCEDING TO YOUR DEMANDS AND THIS CAME AFTER COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DID THE OPPOSITE. WHAT HARVARD DID -- WE TALKED ABOUT IT AFTER IT HAPPENED -- BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS DAVID SAID, THE STATURE OF HARVARD, HARVARD GAVE ALL THE OTHER COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES LOOKING FOR LEADERSHIP AT A TIME WHEN THEY WERE UNDER INTENSE ASSAULT AND THE PRESIDENT GAVE THEM -- UNDER INTENSE ASSAULT FROM THE PRESIDENT AND GAVE THEM A BEACON. HARVARD IS FIGHTING FOR ITSELF AND FOR ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND FOR THE FREEDOM OF UNIVERSITIES TO TEACH THE NEXT GENERATION OF NOT JUST STUDENTS BUT OF LEADERS. GEOFF: THE OTHER STORY TO TALK ABOUT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MEETING IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT IN WHAT MANY DESCRIBE AS AN AMBUSH. THE PRESIDENT USED MISREPRESENTED IMAGES TO SUPPORT FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT WHITE GENOCIDE IN SOUTH AFRICA. HOW DID THIS MEETING STRIKE YOU? AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OVERALL MESSAGE? >> DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO BE HOSTILE TO ALL IMMIGRANTS UNLESS YOUR ANCESTORS CREATED APARTHEID. THE RACIAL ELEMENT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS. THE SECOND THING, NOT QUITE AS APPALLING BUT A CLOSE SECOND, HOW DISHONEST, HOW DETACHED FROM REALITY THE CHARGE IS. I LOOKED FOR THE CRIME STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA AND IT TOOK ME A HALF-HOUR OF INTERNET SEARCHING FOR CREDIBLE AUTHORITIES. IS THERE GENOCIDE? THERE ARE 27,000 MURDERS IN SOUTH AFRICA. IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE ARE TARGETED BECAUSE OF THEIR SKIN COLOR? NOT REALLY. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS HAVE SOMEONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE DO 15 MINUTES OF GOOGLING BUT THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BASIC LOYALTY TO -- MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHAT IS GOING ON THERE AND THAT IS A DETACHMENT FROM REALITY. >> THE OVAL OFFICE HAS BECOME A VENUS FLY TRAP. YOU WALK IN AND MAY NOT GET OUT ALIVE. WE SAW IT HAPPEN WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY WHO GOT MAULED IN THE OVAL OFFICE. GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER WAS CALLED INTO THE OVAL OFFICE AND TRIED HIDING HER FACE BEHIND FILE FOLDERS BECAUSE SHE WAS CAUGHT IN THERE. AND NOW YOU HAVE THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT SITTING WITH A PRESIDENT TRYING TO FACT-CHECK HIM AND DOING A LITTLE JOKE ABOUT -- I WISH WE HAD SOMETHING TO OFFER YOU. THAT PLACE IS NOT -- THE OVAL OFFICE IS NO LONGER A SERIOUS PLACE OF BUSINESS. LEADERS GO IN THERE AND I WATCH TO SEE HOW IS THE PRESIDENT GOING TO HUMILIATE THE PERSON IN THE MOST UNSERIOUS WAY POSSIBLE WHILE LENDING CREDENCE TO ALREADY DEBUNKED RACIST THEORIES. I'M GLAD YOU POINTED OUT THE FACT THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF RACIST COMMENTS, RACIST ACTIONS AND PEDDLING WHITE GRIEVANCE. HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH IMMIGRANTS AS LONG AS THEY DON'T COME FROM -- COUNTRIES. AND THEY ARE USUALLY NOT WHITE. GEOFF: WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS IF WHAT USED TO BE A COVETED INVITATION TO THE WILL -- TO THE OVAL OFFICE? >> THE UNDERSTAND HE HAS ALL THE POWER BECAUSE THE U.S. NEEDS THEM LESS THAN THEY NEED THE U.S. IT IS THE PERFECT SITUATION FOR A BULLY.

Yt7SIeAN9Ao,733257,9416,0,Pacers Stun Knicks and Go Up 2-0 In Series 😳 + Tyrese Haliburton Joins The Fellas 🗣️ | NBA on TNT,20250524,"in his 82nd career playoff game, the most of any Indiana Pacer on this roster. It's a career playoff high 39 for Pascal Seakum. And it's a two nothing lead for the Indiana Pacers over the New York Knicks. About 20,000 stunned walking out of Madison Square Garden tonight cuz the number three seed is in an 02 hole and heading to Indiana. Welcome everybody inside the NBA presented by Kia. Ernie Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, Draymond Green, Kenny the Jet Smith, and Charles Barkley. Did anybody on this panel before the series started see it being two nothing Indiana after these first two? Absolutely not. We all We've seen Indiana go on the road and win games all playoffs long, but I don't think anyone had this on their bingo card as everyone's been saying. I thought the Knicks was going to have a little bit more fight. The crowd was never into the game. I want to ask you guys a question. Uh seen a lot lot of scout room reports, but Phil Jackson did something I've never seen done before. Of course, you talk about players, but if they can be a threat, he will put threat. For example, Seakkum as the player is, but they didn't take him as a threat tonight. He went off like, you know, probably, you know, concentrating on Hallebert and concentrating on Nmith. Hey, we're going to look out for Nith tonight, but they didn't treat um Pascal Seakum like a threat. Well, I I I think one of your points you always make when you cuz I told you I think he's the most underrated player in the league. I told you that. I thought he played tonight like you know what I let my team down in game one. Yes. And he came out aggressive from the get-go and I thought he set the tone because and he's the only person kept me in the game the first half. But you know Shank, you always talk about a great player can't have two bad games. That's to me what Syakam did tonight. You know what? Even though we won, I didn't do my part, but he got it going tonight. Yes, he did. And then the rest of the guys joined the party, but he the only reason they were in the game in the first place. Well, he he played extraordinarily well. But the interesting thing about the Indiana Pacers is that they could have four guys take 20 shots different nights. Naymith, Hallebertton, Turner, Seakum, Nemar, Nimar take 20, right? But those four, you wouldn't be surprised if they took 20 shots. So, it's hard to defend a team that is that versatile, and that's why they are where they are now. Well, here's what I'll say with Pascal. He didn't They don't run plays for him, so he got it in transition. That's my point. He he came and got the switch and and took advantage of the switch. So, it's a lot harder to key on that. Cedric Sabalos, I was just going to say I played with a guy just like that. says to Balos, he's the I've never seen a guy move better without the ball and finish with 20 25 points and I'm like we didn't run a single play for him. I said best well cuz Kevin Johnson Dan Marley was shooting it all the time. Just kidding. Uh the thing about look you're all defensive ninth time this year but you know how tough a cover this guy is. Pascal Seakkum. Tell me about defending him. He's a very tough cover. It's like it reminds me of Boris Dial. Like he's never like soon as you touch his body, he'll spin off you and so you can never get leverage on him. I was speaking the other day about our series with uh Minnesota and I was saying the only I lost my matchup to Julius Randall. The only other time I really felt like I lost my matchup in the series was against Pascal Siaka when we played Toronto, his championship that Shaq's been talking about, he destroyed me. And it's hard to figure out because it's not like a set play to where you can key on one move. It's it's just like random action and he find a way to get the points. He's extremely tough cover. And what I love about this guy, he's definitive with his moves. He don't you don't dance around, put it between his legs, you make a mistake defensively, one or two dribbles, either that pull up jump shot or he's going straight to the basket. You know, Ernie, thing I like about him too, he kind of plays like a little old school guy. What I mean by that is he never let a little guy play him ever. the way the way the NBA's day where everybody switches everything. Anytime they put a little dude on him and this game was so simple watching the the Pacers just ran a pick and roll every time and took advantage of the mismatches whether it was Hallebert and Dancing or Seakum or Miles Turner. I I never understand in NBA why guys don't be like they never hunt out mismatches but the Pacers will hunt out mismatches all over the place. Kenny, I guess they answered the question that was posed before the game. Would they be satisfied just leaving here with a split? No. Like I said, these are the final four teams. They're not No one's satisfied. They understand what's at stake. Now, when you get this close to the end of the tunnel, you have a tunnel vision. You understand what's what's at stake. So there's a a focus from game to game. Uh and and you know the one thing that the Knicks have to understand is like when you put yourself in an O2 hole and you're saying now you can beat the team four out of five times that you couldn't even beat at home. That is an and you could be down 02 coming home, but it's very difficult to be 02 going back on the road and for the first time. That is probably insurmountable. And I'm going say I'm I got two points I want because Tyrese Hallebertton is ready to go. So we do want to talk to him about game two here. Tyrese, thanks a lot for joining us. We appreciate you. Free free your dad. Free your dad, brother. Free pop. Free pop. Free pops backwards, man. Free pop. So u here's a here's a question for you. Look, you guys uh six and one on the road. Impressive. 7-0 in clutch games. Tell me what goes into that. How how do you stay undefeated in clutch time in these five-point games, 5 minutes or less? And how much of it is a state of mind? Uh and doing it also in a building like this that uh is so loud. Uh yeah, I think preparation and experience. I think um you know, I think we we prepare for these moments. We've been involved in a lot of funky games in the year just figuring out how to way win in so many different ways and and even in the playoffs we've had to figure out how to win in so many different ways like game one. Um and when I say experience I don't I'm not acting I'm not sitting here acting like I'm a vet or something. I'm I'm just saying we've uh we've as a group we've been together you know I think in the NBA right now it's it's so common uh for heavy roster turnover from year to year. And I think after last year uh the front office did a great job of keeping this group together and we've just experienced so many different things together. winning, losing, uh figuring out how to win in many ways, figuring out uh how to, you know, how we're losing and how to correct that. So, um yeah, I think that those those are the big two things. Tyrese Shak here, I owe you an apology. Uh during the interview with Reggie, you was a lot of little bit too much giggling for me. I was like, I want these guys to be serious and you guys were serious. So, what was that to the guys and having that killer instinct and you know, getting this win tonight? Yeah, I think just uh coming out here and understanding what we were getting into. I think after you take a game like game one, you understand that they're going to come into the game uh probably a little frustrated. Didn't feel like they should have they probably don't feel like they should have lost game one. Feel like they gave it away. So, we knew they were going to amp up the physicality and uh play with some pace, but I think the biggest thing for us as a group was don't wait for them to throw the first punch. Let's throw the first punch and then roll from there. And I thought we did a good job of that. Um you know, I think we just are doing a good job just locking in, taking it play by play, uh quarter by quarter, and uh you know, it's leading to good things for us. Tyrese as the as the playmaker on this team, the guy who's getting everybody involved. How is it playing with Pascal where y'all don't call many sets for him, but you know during that fourth quarter it was a kind of a stretch where he wasn't getting the ball and then finding him to get him back cuz his his offense is so random. It comes from all over all over the place. How are you as a point guard finding him in these situations to make sure he stays involved in the offense although y'all don't run many sets for him? Yeah, to be honest, I was pretty trash at that today. Uh, I got to do a better job getting the rock, especially when he's cooking like that. Um, you know, I think down the stretch, I got to do a better job of getting him the ball. Uh, but man, he made so many big plays, big shot after big shot. Um, you know, and I got to do a better job that I wasn't great at that today, but um, you know, I think it's I think that's part of basketball. It's not linear success, you know, and it's not linear growth and it's not always going to be, you know, this this great facilitating game. I have games where I'm I'm not very good at that. So, I had to do a better job of that. I'll do a better job game three. But man, he was unbelievable today. Uh we had a lot of different guys step up and uh man, it really started with him. Well, you know, Tyrese as a overrated point guard. No, seriously. You know, there are things that you have to come to the arena and say, you know, as a point guard, we used to say, well, there's three things you got to do. For me, I was I say, I'm going to push the ball as fast as I can. I'm going to make sure I make great entry passes. I'm going to run into my shot. Those are the three things I'm like, I got to do that every day. What are the three things that you say for this team? Because it isn't always scoring. Yeah. That you say, ""I got to do these three tonight."" Yeah. I think uh obviously get guys involved, right? I think um consistent conversation with the coaching staff, seeing what they're seeing. Um you know, I thought we did a poor job in the first half of getting downhill. You know, we were living in the long twos and Pascal was bailing us out a lot of the time, but I thought we had a lot of different guys step up. Um and just trying to keep that consistent conversation. Um, and then I think defensively for me just trying to do the best I can. You know, I think if I'm doing my job on that end, being solid, you know, it's easier for for guys to hold me accountable. And I think it also gives me more equity to hold guys accountable if I'm, you know, doing my job there and helping out and just doing the best I can on that end. So, uh, those are the biggest things for me. Um, and at the end of the day, just figure out ways to win. Just figure out ways to win, you know. I think that that starts with me as at the point guard position and then, um, yeah. Yeah. Just try to win games. You know, I don't think you guys came out to play tonight. I thought y'all came out flat, lacadasical because if you actually look the only guy played well the first half was Pasco. So I thought y'all came out like we got the split. What happened at halftime that say some Did somebody say something to guys? Let's get greedy. Pascal cuz he's the only one played good in the first half. Yeah. Did somebody say something at halftime guys let's get off our ass and go? Well, I I mean I think the biggest thing uh conversation at halftime was we probably played one of our worst halves of the playoffs outside of the Cleveland game three. That was probably one of our worst halfs and we're only down three. Yeah. So, you know, I think for us it was like uh hey, nobody's playing good right now except for P, you know, so everybody let's join the party, you know, P, appreciate it. Let's keep it going. Uh keep doing what you're doing. But, you know, when you're have play such a terrible half like that, uh and you're only down three, I think that gives you a lot of confidence. And I thought we did a great job coming out in the third quarter. We started the fourth quarter well. Um, you know, I I thought we did a great job of that, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I agree with you. Nobody Nobody was good in the first half. Hey, Tyrese, I'm a big boxing fan and you see in in a lot of these big fights when a guy take their best shot and it does nothing to them. They just keep pressing forward. And I feel like that's how y'all looked out out there tonight. Like is y'all mind, yo, we've taken their best shot. We know we can take their best shot. Let's keep pressing forward. Well, I think just trying to take it a play at a time, bro. I think um you know this team similar to us has had to find ways to win in many different ways. You see last series they had like two 20point comebacks or whatever the case was. Um so they're very similar to us where you know you you you never stop playing. You never can relax. Uh because Jaylen starts making shots and those other guys get in on the rebounds and crash and get extra shots and everybody gets going and the crowd gets into it you know and the the billion celebrities that are here or whatever. Everybody gets into the game. Uh, so I think we we just got to do a good job of taking it um, you know, play by play to the best of our ability. But, um, yeah, I think that that you definitely have to look at it like that sometimes, but honestly, it's like until clock hits zero, this team's very similar to us and the fact that, you know, the game's not over till it's over. Got one more, Tyrese, and I appreciate your patience as you as you face this long line of questioning, but we have an extra guy, Draymond Green, here on the set. Uh, and I don't want you to miss the bus, but you did this against Cleveland, too. Yeah. uh you know won the first two and then you got went home and got last three. Yeah. Yeah. So, how do you prevent that this time and how much discussion will there be about that? Yeah. I think that's the main conversation right now. You know, I think uh you come in here, you steal two, which is a, you know, a great thing. Uh but you can't relax when you get home. And I feel like last series we did that. Uh so I thought we had a great conversation there after the game about it. Uh we got to lock in and take care of game three. Uh everybody knows Indy500's on the same day. Uh so we'll have some some rowdy fans, maybe a little intoxicated. Who knows how it'll get out there. Uh, you know, it'll be it'll be a lot of fun. Uh, I think they call it Pacers and Racers. You know, it's my first time experiencing it, so it'll be a lot of fun. I'm I'm really looking forward to it. Congratulations on second win here at the Garden and a two nothing lead in the series. Congratulations, man. Thanks a lot for spending the time. Yes, sir. Chuck Chuck, what did you say? You going to get steak at St. Elmo? How you getting it done? Get it done. I'm taking uh Well done. Come on, brother. Yeah. Come on, dog. Just takes a little longer. You're too old for that, bro. You like medium. You like medium medium rare. Oh my god. I would never eat medium rare. Too old for that. Come on, man. I'm from Alabama, man. We just throw some some salt on it. You have had a lot of experience, man. You've been to a lot of cities. Been around for a long time, man. St. Elmo tomorrow night. It's going to be on fire. Okay. You want You want me to bring Pops? You want You want to go with Pops? Hey, you want to bring Pops? You're welcome to it, brother. I'm taking I'm taking the Godfather tomorrow night. You're welcome to have dinner with us. We're going to be there. Say that. Say that. Appreciate you, brother. Finish your breakfast, Ree. Yes, sir. I got you, baby. Do we have time to talk? We do, but let's hear from Tibs first. What do you say? I would love to hear from Tibs. Tom, what can what can Pat do to just get a little more comfortable when he has to defend in space far from the rim? I just keep working at it. Tom, I'm I'm curious. There was that unbelievable play that uh Mitch made uh on the block and then it looked like maybe he came down on his ankle. Um the immediate play after that was a play out to the corner that it didn't really look like he could contest just because of his ankle. Did he lose a little bit of steam at all after he kind of looked like he rolled it? You know, I again I I don't think so. Tom, they they played 11 guys tonight and uh obviously down the stretch they were able to pull away a little bit. Um is fatigue a factor late in these games here? Well, you know, we had a chance to tie the ball game so it's a hardfought game. Both games came down to the last play, so you know, it's whatever you think it is. All right, good stuff here. Uh, post game two and here are the highlights. I don't think it's going to happen, but I could ask a deal with seven of these, Arie. You were right there. No doubt. I'll take four myself. Well, that's what we going to get. Just the start of an incredible night for Pascal. Oh my god, man. I tell you what, he kept them single-handedly the game in the first half. cuz the rest of the guys were on spring break. I mean, he came out he came out and scored 16 in the first quarter. But you know what also in this era of you know shooting point guard shooting scoring point guards or converted two guards to point guards Hallebertton is a traditional point guard where he's going to get people involved. He said the first thing that I think about is get people involved. I tell you what man that's just Jaylen Bronson. He unearned some respect man. Yeah, he he scores at will, Chuck. He's a guy who can get it done. OG Anobi played well today. He he really early in the game, he was active. He was giving guys second opportunities. He and Mitchell Robinson, but you know, just eating the glass. They were eating the glass today. I tell you what, Mitchell Robinson just handling these little dudes down low, you know. But then come on, I kill him big, I kill them little. That's what he said right here. Kill him big or kill him what? Kill him big, kill him little, no question. He takes on all comers. At this point, he's got 21 of Indiana's 31 points. Offensive rebounds again killed Indiana in the first half and that's what kept the Knicks going. Yeah. And like 50/50 balls. That turns into a three-pointer for Cat. They clean these offensive rebounds up. They'll beat them by 20. This was one of the few mistakes by Robinson where he was able to get beat off the dribble, but he's played well throughout the game. Yeah, I I really thought the Knicks was going to have a lot more fight tonight than tonight. Couple spurts, man. Yeah, but couple spurts ahead of the crowd in the game and you supposed to take off. Never never could quite get away from the paces. 52 to 49 your halftime score. See, now these other guys are getting going hard. Yeah, they took the first half off. Now they're going now. It's one more. Yep. Had a dozen. Get it out the net. Hallebertton. You know what I remember on that? You should have heard this arena went silent when he got the ball out of the corner. They just knew what was going to happen. Man, Miles Turner brought this thing home, too. Game one six. And K really got benched. They sure did. And I didn't understand that because when Robinson was only making one out of two free throws, you got to go back to your best player and one. That's fundamentals right there, boy. Yeah. And and the under he's underrated in terms of his size. People don't think that he's 6'9. Oh, with with a 7 foot wingsman. We know Majuri is amazing. Every player he picks. All right. So, here we go. 81 apiece going to the fourth quarter. Oh, don't leave him open. Ben Shepard for three. Ben Shepard. Hey, that little guy right there, McConnell. Yes, sir. Man, you got to give him some flowers, too. Oh my god. He buries it. Jeez. And they would build a 10-point fourth quarter lead. Well, you know, shot. I have no idea how he makes that shot. The funny thing is you keep saying that we were saying that, you know, Seakum scores from different places. No kidding. He's the only guy who made the All-Star team this year. 200 bases. 13 fourth quarter points for Miles Turner. Look, see, that's not a play. That's just outrun working. It's hard to scout that. There's your 10point lead. And this man single-handedly tried to bring these boys back. Is it too much though? It's too much. Way too much. Yeah. But he you got Hey man, that's all he he gives all this effort. That's all you can ask him of a shot. So 110 107 and suddenly life back in the garden where moments earlier it had been silent and now Brunson banged him. What a great find man. They got lucky on this out of bounds play. He grabbed his shirt. I didn't like this shot right here. I didn't like that one either. Well, it's not much you can do. You got to get something up if you just didn't want that. But he had plenty of time. Just didn't want that. And Indiana hasn't shown to be a foul team in that situation. They didn't do it twice the other night. Exactly. You know, the uh Knicks won the boards again, but that huge rebound right there to seal the deal for Indiana. uh got one when they absolutely needed it and they win the game 114 to 10939 for Pascal Seakum and it's two nothing Kenny in favor of the Indiana Pacers going home for three and four. Yeah, the thing that you have to be aware of is you you're going to go home with a great deal of confidence, but at certain times I think Draymond and Shaq and Chuck, you can answer this. You have to find isolation within this and jubilation. So you because when you go to a restaurant, everyone's excited. All of the banners around. So it could give you a gassing situation of like you better than you are. The reason why they're better than the Knicks right now, they outworked them. And so you you didn't outskill the Knicks. You outwork the Knicks in key moments. And if you believe that you're just skillfully can walk in there and be Kobe Bryant and be Michael Jordan. No, no, no, no. You have to grind this game out and isolation and jubilation. Well, number one, you can't go out this weekend 100%. Because you got the Indianapolis 500 there. So, not only you going to be gassed up by the Pacers fans, you're going to be gassed up cuz all them them racing fans going to be getting drunk all weekend. So, you got to stay under that. But I want to say this as a guy in a unique situation. I've lost the first two games at home and I've won the first two games on the road. And I remember something the great Paul Westfall said to me. He said, ""Guys, we just got to win a game. We were going to play the Lakers. We were the number one seed in the West and we they came in and shocked us. James Worthy was on that team and we were in shell shock."" And Paul sit us down. He said, ""Okay guys, let's do not panic. Let's go and win game three and put the pressure on them in game four."" He said, ""We get back to Phoenix, we're going to win the series."" And that's what happened. And I So we went down to Houston and played these guys 02. We won the first two games in Houston the year they won the championship. We were we were the best two teams in the NBA. Went they beat us in seven. But I remember telling the guys after we won the first two in Houston. We can't come back here. We cannot come back here. And if I'm if I'm Rick and and Tyrese and know guys, we're not going back to New York. Y'all saw what happened when we let down in game three against Cleveland. Donovan went crazy number one. I says, ""We're not going back to New York. Only thing matters is game three."" Cuz we win game three. They know it's a wrap. But I'm telling these guys, I I like cuz I I remember telling these guys when we beat against guys, we got to wrap this thing up in four. They end up beating us in seven. When you look up and win the first two games on the road, you cannot come back. Want to put a period on this one? Yes. Uh, India, you all the fellas make a a great point. You know, we all speak from experience, but I think I think Indiana will be ready and and they need to be ready. You know, we need to, excuse me, we they need to play well, play hard, put this team away, put doubts in their mind, win, not not not only win game three, win by 20, 30 points and let them know it's over. Because you make a good point, Chuck. If you lose those two and now best out of three, even if the whole series can change, even if it goes 3-1, if it go 3-1, they coming back here. And then let me tell you something. They're not going to win game five here. They're not going to win game five here. I I haven't been I haven't been that impressed with the with the garden mystique. Chuck, when someone brings in a medium rare steak, I'm not eating no damn medium steak. Look, this dude has been eating shoe leather his entire life and he's not about to stop. He'll eat street meat, but he won't eat meat anymore. Did you get street meat yesterday? I did. Put the white sauce. Oh, got to put the white sauce on it. Got to cover up that raccoon and skunk under there. Might be some red. I don't know what kind of meat that is. You put the white sauce on there. Let them drip sauce. How they drip it on there. The MVP are up two zip. [Music]",0.055,0.773,0.172,1.0
T6OMx2NCWxw,406702,11501,0,Tiny MOUSE vs HUNGRY KITTY in Roblox..,20250524,"Today we are the cutest mice in Roblox. This is so fun. We look super cute. Yeah, Snowy, but being a mouse isn't always about being cute. We have to be sneaky today. Uh-oh. How come? Because the cats are hungry and they can smell mice. We got to survive and complete tasks today to make it out alive. Hey, Tyler. I'm going to save other mice today. Me, too, Snowy. Save them for lunch because I could become a cat today. Oh no. Oh gosh. I'm just a little mouse in this giant kitchen. And in 20 seconds, Snowy is going to spawn in as a cat. I got to hide. I got to hide. Can I hide inside of this bottle? Oh man, it won't let me in there. Hey, it looks like somebody spilled these chips over here. Oh my gosh, I can hide inside of this Pringles can. That is a super OP hiding spot. Ready or not, here we come, Tyler. Oh gosh, guys, look at how many cats there are. There's three of them. I need to get to higher ground. I can climb this broom right here. And yes, from the top of this broom, I can already see a cat down there. Oh gosh, guys, they're right there. Yeah, Tyler, it's me. Oh. Uh, did I say you're right there? Um, I definitely don't see you, Snowy. Guys, I'm hiding right underneath this table right here. Is there any mice at this pot? I don't see any, guys. She's right there. Oh my gosh, look at that. Hopefully, she can get off the counter and I can go start saving mice. Oh, she got off the counter. No, there's another one over there. Dude, are you kidding me? Guys, check it out. If we catch mice, we put them in these little tiny kettles. Hey, there's a bopper right here. Wo! It threw me under the roof of the fridge and I'm hiding behind this tea kettle right here. This is super scary. Guys, there's a brown cat right there. And I think he smells me. Quick, hit the like button right now to save me from the cat. The likes are coming in. Yes, it worked. The like button created a mouse sound that distracted the cat and it made him jump off. Yeah, but it looks like these cats are pros and a bunch of the mice are already being caught in cages. Now, where are the other mice hiding? It's just that there's three left, but I don't see any. They're so tiny. I'm going to go for it. Run, mouse. Run with your little mice feet and free them. Yes, I saved someone, Snowy. I saved them. Hey, there's a little mouse running down here. Is this the one you saved, Tyler? Cuz I'm about to get them. And pounce. Oh, yeah. I know mice are not supposed to be in kitchens, but the smell of the pizza was too tempting. Wait a second. It's pepperoni pizza. I wanted cheese pizza. Nothing to like pepperoni to ruin a good cheese pizza. Oh, it's pepperoni pizza, Tyler. It's already the best kind of pizza. Guys, vote in the comments down below. Are you team cheese pizza like me or team pepperoni like Snowy? You'll see that comment, Snowy. Everybody is team cheese pizza. I'm always team pepperoni except for when I'm team mouse pizza which is right now. And I'm always team free the mice. I'm freeing them. Go free my mouse brothers. Go free. Ah no. There's a cat right there. There's a cat right there. There's a cat right there. No. No. I can't have this. Yes. I got one above. Oh man. I got defeated. Yes. The mice win. Mice gang forever. Hey, look Zoe. I was the MVP for saving three mice. Nice job, Tyler. I was probably the least valued cat. Wa! Huh? Where am I? I'm behind you, Snowy. Ow! Oh my gosh, we look so cute. This is so cool. Adopt us today at Tyler Snowy Doto. Don't miss out. I'm a mouse, Tyler. We could be a little mice together. Oh, Tyler, looks like we're in a playroom now. Are you a mouse, too? Yes, Snowy. I'm totally a mouse. Let me know where you're hiding so I can meet you over there once I spawn in. Wait, what do you mean once you spawn in? The mice are already spawn in. You're definitely a guy. Oh. Uh, I don't know what you're talking about, but the cats just spawned in, and I'm one of them. Oh, I see a mouse. Oh, get him. Get him. It looks like the mice have three lives. And oh my gosh, I just oofed this mouse. That was crazy. Hey, there's a little bit of cheese. Mind if I just take a little nibble nibble? Just a little bit of cheese. Hey, is that you, Snowy? I'm chasing a mouse right now. Oh, I got him down to two lives. They have two lives left. They have two lives left. Wa! Ow! I hit a bopper and then it hit my head on the table. Come on. Come on. Let me get that mouse. Get back here. Get back here. Get back here. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. Yes, I got him. I'm just relaxing eating cheese cuz you'll never get me, Tyler. And I'm going to eat all the cheese on the map. Wait a second. I see a mouse eating cheese over there. If they eat all of the cheese, then they can escape. I'm going to get you, Snowy. Is that you with the cheese on the red table? It was me, but I ran away cuz you can't get me. I'm going to get you. Super kitty Tyler is coming up on you. Where you going? Where you going? I'm going nowhere, Tyler. Oh no, I got a heart down. I need to escape before he oops me. Oh man, Snowy got away from me. But Snowy, it's only you and one other mouse remaining and I will find you guys. This is so scary, guys. I'm hiding in the smallest place I could possibly find right now. And there's cats all around me. Check this out, guys. There's little doors like this on the map. And these doors are going to open up if all three of the cheeses have been eaten. And it says there's only two left. Uh-oh. That means the escape doors are going to open if the mice eat the last two pieces of cheese. Hey Tyler, I made a mouse friend and we're just sitting here eating cheese together. Oh man, where are you Snowy? You'll never find us. We're in a super good hiding spot. Come on, just a little bit more cheese. And yes, we did it. Oh my gosh, I see the mice over there. They're going for it. Hey mouse, what are you doing? What you doing? No. No. Leave me alone. Please spare me. Oh man, it says there's only one piece of cheese left for the mice to eat and then they can escape. I got to figure out a way to guard the cheeses or something. We still have 1 minute left. We could totally do it. Yes, that other mouse caught the last one. And the door is open. It's time to escape. Bye, Tyler. I found your little mouse friend, Snowy. I found your little mouse friend. I'm going to get him. I'm going to get him. Oh, I caught your little mouse friend before they could escape. That is so crazy. No, I was the only survivor. But at least I meant victory for all mice. Nice job, Snowy. You are the only mouse that escaped and lives to tell the tale of the great kitty slaughter. No more playing around, guys. It is me, Super Spy Mouse Snowy. I have become a super spy. I look so cool. And I'm superhero Snowy Mouse. Tyler, look at my little cape. Oh my gosh, it's perfect. We look so cute. Guys, hit the like button right now if you think we look super cute. Yeah, guys, how can you not? But silly, we got to run and hide. The cat just spawned right where we were standing. Oh, no. He's right in front of me. I'm going to hide over here. Luckily, it's easy to hide as a mouse cuz we're so tidy. As the spy mouse, I have to spy on the cat, Snowy. And it looks like he's underneath the bed. Oh my gosh, guys. Look, he's chasing some other mice. Snowy, come up on the bed with me. It's super bouncy. I could do this forever, Syler. This is so fun. But Snowy, my super spy reader is reading that the cat is nearby. So, we have to be careful. Oh my gosh, he's right down there. And he oofed somebody. No, we can't help him this round. Tyler, come on, Zoe. Let's go down here and let's go up on the table in the center super spy style. Ooh, I feel like I'm in this game right now. I never knew what it feel like to be inside of foosball. Oh, I know. They use the ball. Is that a ball? Look, silly. The cat's right there. Do you think he sees us? I think he ate all of the mice except for us, Snowy. Oh no, he's coming this way. Come on, silly. Let's hide in this truck right here. This is the perfect spy hiding place. Oh yeah, this is totally the perfect hiding place. We're still going to win this round. We just have to survive for 2 and 1/2 more minutes. We are the last players remaining. Snowy, look. Everyone else has an X over them. I can't believe it. Oh no, he's right there. Snowy, he's right there. Look, he does not know where we are. This is the perfect eyes. Oh, I'm running for it. Let's go. Go, Tyler. Go. Don't look back. I think he saw us, Snowy. Come on. Let's run up here. Oh no, he's right down there. I'm jumping to this dinosaur. Let's go. Oh no, he's definitely on our tail, Tyler. He's chasing us. Oh no, we split up and he got me. No. No. He got you, Snowy. That's so sad. I am the last remaining spy that's out in the battlefield. Day 43 of my super spy mission. The cat has not yet detected me, but I feel like he's getting close. He's right there. Where's he going? So, I still have a minute left that I have to survive. This is so scary. But Tyler, not to put pressure on you or anything, but you have to survive for the rest of us. I can use one of my spy abilities. It says that I can lay down some glue. Okay, guys. I bought the glue and I could put some glue down on the floor over here. So, if the cat comes over here, he'll get stuck. Good thinking, Tyler. Use all your little mouse detective tricks. I'm going to put some glue right here. And Oh, he's coming this way. Oh, I got him stuck, Zoe. I got him stuck in the glue. Haha. You got outsmarty kitty. Oh no, Zoe. Now he's angry. Wa! Tyler, that was so close. He almost got you in his paws. But Zoe, I was able to trap him in the glue. That was awesome. Yes, Tyler, you did it. You won it for everyone. A Yeah. Super spa mouse. Wa! Look at this map. Where are we? It looks like we might be at a campground. Meow. Meow. Snowy because Tyler Cat has arrived at the campground and I'm a super awesome rainbow kitty. Hey, I see you right there, Snowy. I see you. No, Tyler. No, we were supposed to eat s'mores together. I got you in a rat trap. What you going to do about it? What you going to do? Hopefully, one of my mouse friends will free me and I'll get you back. No. No. This mouse freed you. Well, I'm going to get this mouse and he's going to be trapped over here. Wa! There's a bunch of mice back here. Oh man, he's running away. I can catch you though. I'm a cat and I'm faster. I think I have to click on them. Yes, I got one. Wo, there's a lot to catch. I think there's like three of you out there. Yes, our goal is to catch all of the mice that are on the campground today. Today is the first day of summer and all of the campers are going to be camping out here. But they're not going to be camping if there's mice everywhere. Oh man, I got caught again. Hey, I see one down there. I'm going for him. I'm going for him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Come on. Come on. He's running away. He's running away. This mouse is really hard to catch. Yes, I'm free. And I'm going to try to get to a better hiding spot so no cats can even see me or get me. I'm going to climb the ladder. I don't think the cats could climb this ladder. Oh yeah. Well, cats could climb stairs. I think I'm going up a lighthouse right now. This thing is super tall. These stairs are endless, dude. Okay, guys. I made it to the top of this lighthouse. What can I see from up here? Hey, what the I see a little mouse on top of that RV over there. And it's you, Snowy. It's a snowy colored mouse. Oh no, I need to hide quick. There's no way I'm safe here now. Oh my gosh, there's so many mice running around. Ooh, there's a cave in here. I can definitely hide in here. And they won't see me. Wo, there's drums and everything over here. There's a hungry rainbow kitty behind you. No. No. Leave me alone. I'm just an innocent mouse. But you know I'm going to steal the camper's food. No. You got me. I'm so hidden. None of my mice friends are going to find me back here. Is there anyone inside of this camper in here? No. I don't see any mice. There's only 5 seconds left. 3 2 1. No. I couldn't catch any more mice. Yay. We win. Thanks, guys. Even though you were all locked up at the end there. Yeah, Tyler. I had to get sacrificed. Hey, Snowy, we're back at the campsite. And I am Super Spy Mouse Tyler. Where are you, Snowy? We got to meet up. Yay! I'm so glad you're a mouse, Tyler. Come on, Snowy. Let's head to the top of the lighthouse. It's the perfect place to spy on the kitties, cuz I got to do my spying. We should definitely survive if we're both in this together, Tyler. Totally, silly. It's freeze tag again. So, if you get caught, I'll try to unfreeze you. Oh no. Yo, there's a cat right there. Don't come in the lighthouse, Zoe. There's a cat. Oh no, guys. I'm going to jump out of here. Let's go spy style. The cat's coming after me. I saw a bunch of you run in the lighthouse and then so did the cat. Okay, guys. We got to regroup and we got to stick together. Everybody listen up. It's time for a super spy plan. And the plan is Don't let the cats get us. Yeah. The plan is to run. Oh no, Shy. I think one of the cats spotted us. Get away. He's coming over here. Okay. Okay, I'm running. Yes, we made it away. We barely made it away from that one. Hey, there's a boat over here. Let's see if we can get on the boat, Snowy. Maybe by these ropes. Yes, it's working. Wo! You have to be very careful to balance on them. Yes, I made it. Ooh, you could go inside of the boat down here. Wo! This is an OP hiding spot. Oh no, there's a cat chasing me. Run, Tyler. Oh, he got me. No, wait. Silly, where are you? They didn't get me yet because I used my super spy skills to get away. I'm on the boat, Tyler. And he's guarding me. Hold on, silly. Let me equip a banana. I can get some bananas and then they'll slip on them when I use them. Okay, guys. I got to use my super spy traps. And oh my gosh, I see him right there. But I put a banana down. And I freed you, Snowy. Yes. Thank you, Tyler. Oh my gosh, all three cats are after me. Run, Snowy. I ran back down the boat and the bananas at the top of the stairs. None of the cats slipped on it, though. Oh no, I got caught again. Tyler, I'm the worst super mouse. Snowy, you're not supposed to get caught this much. It's up to me as super spy mouse Tyler to free the other mice. Well, I freed one of them, but there's a cat right behind me. Can I equip it? No. Wait, Zoe, I can just buy instant escape. It's called PE to win, baby. Let's go. Nice, Tyler. Keep it going. Oh my gosh, they're totally puppy guarding. And I freed you, Snowy. Let's go. Wait, that wasn't you, Snowy. Where are you? Yeah, you didn't free me, Tyler. What are you talking about? Dang it. Hold on. Let me get some more of these banana traps or these glue traps. I'll free you, Zoe. I'll free you. I'm right here. I freed you. Let's go. Yes. Thanks, Tyler. And with 1 second left, we did it. Yay. Freedom. That was awesome. I'm so glad we were able to escape. Guys, we're going to be being our cute little mice all day long. While we're doing that, you should click on one of those videos that's on your screen right now and subscribe if you haven't already.

I shouldn't even be here neither of us should you heard from centa she's doing what she was told and receiving messages is just as dangerous as sending them you should keep that in mind we have a loose end Cassian the Andor you need to find him you mean kill him we can't have him walking around with Luan in his head we're getting out of here to go where anywhere we want I've got enough credits to get us anywhere but now we've both had our mornings interrupted because you keep submitting requests to the Bureau of Standards data center looking for for Cassian Andor what are you doing Mr Khan

resentencing I don't know anything about it don't ever look at the number you're until they don't want you anymore get straight with that us that enough haven't we been apart long enough I told you up front the struggle will always come first we take what's left you didn't question the mother if nothing else she's our bait she's the reason Andor came back it's the shop owner on fck she's trying to find cassine Andor his mother Isel she might have a leave more likely it's the ISB working her radio are you guessing and you're slipping now I would prefer a conversation rather than put Dr G back to work that isn't time fin up to you hey when was the last time you spoke with Cassie and Andor you're not going to believe me anyway are you no I suppose not she's all yours Dr ghost oh the the restraints are nothing to be feared it's much safer for you to be tethered as we engage what happened down on two a man who was just released on four ended up back on two the next day who got out on the floor and then they killed them all no one's getting out are they not now how many guards on each level never more than 12 there is one way out attack but if it happens now we made it [Music] dead Ramiro she just captured a rebel pilot running supplies to an ker we know that there's a raid planned on the power station at spell house if creger attacks they'll be waiting and if he doesn't they'll know something's a Miss they'll be slaughtered ISB knows krier's plan they'll be waiting for him you think it's worth losing ker it's your decision s where is he you're off the rails you you're lucky he's not here I gave him Al Dan what have you done lately I don't have lately I have always I have a constant blur of plates spinning and knives on the floor and needy panicked faces at the window of which you are but one of many one of us has to make it I know take this people have to know about this I need a loan Davos Calon he is not a banker he's a thug what will it cost I have a 14-year-old son I'd like to bring him with me I'm not asking for betrothal and what are we talking about an introduction your daughter's 13 she'll soon come of age don't tell me you're taking proposals I'm in so much trouble though calling about andle you wanted news of I had it yeah yes please go on the mother she's passed away he might show up at the funeral I never should have left that morning stop she told me you'd say all this tell him he knows everything he needs to know and feels everything he needs to feel and when the day comes those two pulled together he will be an Unstoppable Force for good there will be times when the struggle seems impossible I know this already alone unsure dwarfed by the scale of the enemy I think it's all useless it's better to leave better to eat sleep do what you want what have we done Val we've chosen a side we're fighting against the dark people are standing up freedom is a pure idea it occurs spontaneously and without instruction you have a different path Cass and I am not judging you everything you've been through everything that was taken away from you before you even started ready home take all the money you found and go and find some peace I imagine that no matter what you tell me you or tell yourself you'll ultimately die fighting these [Music] bastards wouldn't you rather give it all at once once to something real then Cal off useless pieces till there's nothing left random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the Galaxy there are whole armies battalions that have no idea that they've already enlisted in the cause the Empire is a disease that thrives in darkness remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere and even the smallest Act of insurrection pushes our lines [Music] forward Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural I'd rather die trying to take them down than die giving them what they want we let it grow and now it's here it's here and it's not visiting anymore tyranny requires constant effort if breaks it leaks Authority is brittle oppression is the mask of fear remember that it's easy for the dead to tell you to fight but I'll tell you this if I could do it again I'd wake up early and be fighting these bastards from the start the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles these moments of Lions will have flooded the banks of the Empire's Authority and then there will be one too many one single thing will break The Siege fight the empire for a greater good call is what you will let's call it War a remember this try C will fight death I will I'll fight you come Marva I'm okay the her I'm thinking about her she'd be proud of [Applause] me kill me or take me in,0.149,0.744,0.107,-0.9985

I was just trying to help. Grab a towel and help out. That was the last of it. You guys managed to make quite a big mess. How about we make her some soup? I'm sure that will make her feel better and cheer her up. That's a great idea. We also make kind of a mess in the kitchen cuz Stitch wanted to have pancakes and donuts and sausages and eggs and I only wanted cereal because Naughty told me to get some cereal. But then Stitch made a huge mess in the kitchen and now it's so messy and now the Lilo is going to be so mad at us. That's okay, Lilo. I'll help. Come on. You guys really need to be under more supervision. Tell me about it. I stopped by the store to get some supplies to make Na chicken soup. I've got some pasta, some chicken stock, some carrots, and some more veggies. Let's put some chicken stockoop chicken, pasta, and the carrots. Now, let's mix. We'll let it cook.

ITZ1VrVE3Bk,561129,4700,3700,Trump says Samsung and others could be next as he threatens 25% tariff on Apple,20250524,"President Trump is now threatening Apple with an industry altering ultimatum either build hundreds of millions of iPhones in the United States, or pay tariffs of at least 25% on iPhon that are made overseas. The president says he's not stop there, making clear that Apple's and some of the biggest tech companies in the world have also been put on notice. It would be more it would be als and anybody that makes that prod Otherwise it wouldn't be fair. So anybody that makes that produ and that'll start on I guess at the end of June it'll come out. I think we have that appropriately done by the end of June. So if they make that product now when they build their plant here, there's no tariff. So they're going to be building plants here. My source tonight is Patrick Mag who is the author of Apple in Ch The Capture of the World's Greatest Company. It's great to have you here toni I should note when you're listening to that, T Cook actually met with President at the white House this week. It clearly did not, you know, stave off whatever he may have been hoping To do so is shifting iPhone production to the United States even possible at this point? Well, it really isn't. But the pressure that Tim Cook i is really that he might have to do some semblance of answering that question. So you might have some assembly  I mean, but the bind that Trump is putti Tim Cook is really extraordinary Remember, Apple doesn't actually manufacture anything th So it's not even a matter of Tim Cook answering Trump. He would have to convince Foxcon share or any number of companies to actually set up a supply chai And Trump's tweet is interesting that he doesn't just ask for ass I mean, he is at least savvy eno to understand that just moving assembly wouldn't be That's not the jobs we want. We want the higher value added. We want the real de-risking from But if you're talking about building the depth and bre of supply chain in America, I mean, you're talking about hundreds of factories. This is the iPhone after all. It's a really complex device with a thousand parts inside. So if you're an American and you're listening to that and you say, okay, well, why shouldn't it be all completely made in the Unite what would you say to that? Well, how much more do you want  for your iPhone, for starters. but you have to remember that they built 230 million iPhones a And this is a really complex pro that gets redesigned every year. So it's not like you set up a pr line for a car and built the sam for the next 6 or 7 years. The iPhone has new components, new battery, new cameras every single year. That makes automation really dif that makes the whole process really complex. And we just don't have like 18 different things. We don't have the density of the population. We don't have the flexibility of the population. We don't have, you know, three kilometer square towns that have 500,000 people inside, which is the sort of thing that you get at Foxconn. I mean, the US is just not a com to so many different things. So like, I'm really in favor of  shoring, right? Doing this in Mexico, doing this in India. Because doing this in Pittsburgh is ludicrous. So what does Tim Cook to do next Do you think he comes out with with some kind of announcement in order to essentially try to not let this happen? Let's remember what he did last time, which is he really ran the clock out on Trump's presidency. So in 2017, I believe, it was Trump announce that Tim Cook had promised to build three big, beautiful factories in America. that never came to be. And I think it's going to be dif for Tim Cook to sort of make the same claim, because Tru sort of on to him. Now that this is someone who talks out the side of his mouth and doesn't actually sort of fulfill the promise, and he's probably wise to the id that the $500 billion commitment that Apple made in February, really, it doesn't really meet the eye, as it were. I mean, that's a lot of money. And the press release saying that of the build 20,000  doesn't really make any sense. And if it was true, you would have dozens of factori already being put up right now. And some people when I when I say that, they say, oh, well, it's only been a few month No, because that's the second big announcement in Trump 1.0. Apple announced $430 billion. announcement, sorry investment in America. So if those were real numbers really about reshoring American  you would have seen so much more over the past decade. Reall And you really have seen none of Patrick McGee, thank you for joi Tonight. In a social media post this morning, President Trump demanded that Apple move their manufacturing operati to the U.S. and start making iPhones here. And if they refuse, he'll impose a 25% tariff on the The president was asked about a  in the Oval Office and indicated that other phone manufacturers would also be subj to the tariffs. I would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that prod Otherwise it wouldn't be fair. So anybody that makes that produ and that'll start on, I guess, the end of June when they build their plant here there's no tariffs. So they're going to be building  You. Well the the idea of Apple produ iPhones in the U.S. is not new. It has consistently been shut do by Apple. Steve Jobs, the late Apple founder and CEO, brought it up to President Obama in 2010, telling him that the US simply didn't have the engineers to support a  based manufacturing operation, a position the current Apple CEO, Tim Cook, is echoed. Even if Apple began moving operations to the U.S. right now, industry experts say it would take 5 to 10 years to set up, and it would dramatically raise the price of an iPhone. Joining me now with more on the story is senior data analyst Harry and Tim. So how many Americans own iPhone You know, let me tell you, when I think of the iPhone, I think of my girlfriend. Why is that? Because every single time I look over to my left, she's on her frickin iPhone, oka And it turns out she's not alone I like antique data. What percentage of Americans are on their phone? Their smartphone? At least two hours a day? What are we talking about here? We're talking about the vast maj Look at that. 75% of Americans are on their sm at least two hours a day. How about six hours? I think that's more where my girlfriend is 23%. We're talking about a quarter of Americans. This is reaching everybody. Now, of course, we're not just talking about cru phones like the one that I have  We're talking about iPhones. You actually use them. I actually use it here. You could play with that. Do they make these? They do make those over. They still make them. I got it from let's just say I got it from an interesting place. Anyway, we're talking about iPhones, rig What number of Americans have iP That's what I asked you. Yes, that is what you asked me. If you look at this, look at the number of Americans who have iPhones at this point. Look at this. In 2004, before the iPhone was c it was zero. Then it was 88,000,000 in 2014. Look at the number that we have  It's 155 million. It's not just that the majority  have an iPhone. It's that the number of American that has the iPhone continues to and it's even more popular among teenagers than it is among adults at large And, if it was manufactured in t how much would the price go up? Yeah. Okay. So that's I think the big question is, okay, let's bring this and we're going to bring let's say we enter a magical universe where Donald Trump gets his way. And the iPhone, in fact, would be produced in America rig The iPhone basically cost about $1,000, right? So that is exactly the exact pri to my girlfriend. But let's say all of a sudden that the iPhone is going to be p here. Well, there are estimates of how that would cost. Look at this es My goodness gracious. It would cost $3,500. That is nut butter, Anderson. That is crazy. So the idea that these tariffs would make the phones actually produced here, to be perfectly honest with you, it's Fantasy Island because what would actually happ Apple would probably either a ea the tariff course or be they would pass it onto the cons but it would not result in what  Donald Trump actually wants, which is the iPhone being produc It would simply put drive up cost for the American consumer. And, you know, I'll ask you one final question. You think the American consumer likes the idea of prices going u is that a hypothetical? It's a hypothetical. Yeah. I'm asking the same question. Ri All right. The answer is no. Of course not. So it would just drive his approval ratings down. This, to me, is one of the silli that Donald Trump has had. And he's had many silly of them, about four months out. Harry Enten, thanks very much. Appreciate it. We're joined now by tech journal CNN contributor Kara Swisher. She's the host of pivot, and on with Kara Swisher podcast Thanks for joining us. How you d I was on the phone with Harry's girlfriend. Yeah, y Yes. What the heck? She's going to be here. She's. She's going to be here next. So what? I'm. What do you think it means for t or for business in general? The president isn't just targeting countries or industrie like when he said he would, you know, tariff firms made overseas, but he's now threatening individual companies. Well, that's what he does. I mean, he used to do it by name in the previous administration. Now he's doing it by company. He can't muscle companies into prices like yelling at Disn or yelling at Apple or whatever. They'll make what they want to m These are massive global corporations that have business all over the  and they're as big as some count Some of these some of these enti Apple will do what's right for A There are some questions about how much money they invested in China. largely Tim Cook, who did all those logistics. And that's a good question to as But the idea of bringing these companies back I think he's he's thinking back in the 80s when they brought the the cars, he or the car manufacturers and that could happen for some s but the prices will go up consid And so that will that'll be a loser for a lot of these cars. Yeah. I mean, it's not realistic for i to be made completely here in the United States. I mean, maybe, maybe they would open some assem or something here. I don't know if that would appease the president. Well, you don't want people making the things that he wants  make are things that United say should make anymore. We should having the advanced research stuff, the newer stuff, maybe some chips and things like But we should be leaning into th not leaning into the past. And I think these, these, these supply lines are all set where they are. And of course they can change, like going to Vietnam or India. That would that's where he also doesn't want them to happen. But they're certainly not going to come back here in the w he's he's living in a different  of of manufacturing. And it's just not the way things are made anymore. And eventually, you know, at some point you'll be printing iPhones in th but not today. It also, I mean, this is why the kind of the attack against foreign students at American University is at Harvard right now. That could be it. Others seems so shortsighted, because if you want stuff being done in the United States, having the best and brightest from all around the world who want to come to the U.S. because we have superior educati and stay in the U.S and work for companies that are  I mean, this is the exact opposite of wh if Trump wants businesses? It doesn't make you want the best possible over coming here. Yeah, yeah, that makes no sense. Let me just list some of the executives that are who are important tech people, such as Nadella, Microsoft CEO, the head of, the head of excuse me, alphabet Sundar Pichai. Elon Musk is from South Africa. you could go through is a Sergey Brin who started Google is from Russia came from  There are so many incredible people working throughout the tech industry. This is this is I don't even understand what's happening here because we have remained innovative due to our ability to bring immigrants into this co and also people that were born h and make them, have entrepreneurial opportuniti they didn't have at home. Now they'll be going back home and doing those things or they'll be sent back home. The whole thing makes zero sense if we want innovation in the fut And I in robotics, in advanced medical stuff, I mean, all the stuff that's going forward, we have to have a robust pipelin of talent from across the globe. Again, global companies, these are not American companies or global companies. You know, Tim Cook went to the inauguratio Obviously, there's a lot of othe the tech folks did hoping to dev a relationship, hoping that would have an impact. just as we have seen with the pr and these law firms, no amount of it seems acquiescen an initial demand is will ever satisfy the president that it's always these law firms have made deals  oh, we're going to only do pro-bono work on things that, you know, we have mutual agreement on, like veterans causes. they they're like, I mean, they can be tapped by this presi to do just about anything. Well, you know, Donald Trump has a limited time in office compared to these comp These companies will be here lat and they will form alliances as they need to, because that they are city states in many ways. If you think about their city co in a lot of ways, and so they'll form alliances and they'll do what they need to but they are also watching to wh and what they need to do. But they always do things in their self-interest. And and Donald Trump can put a lot of pressure on the and it could set us back in many ways, especially in AI or some other things that are co But it's not going to stop the march of capitalism, which is relentless and will not I think the assault on research  is is particularly troubling because, I mean, you know, this  it doesn't get a lot of publicit But, you know, these are doctors, these are, an all sorts of people doing cutting edge research that takes years to set up, years to attract that kind of talent, to destroy it. Now, the ripple effects of it can last for for decades. Yeah. We don't know what didn't get in We didn't know the Google or some health care, the cancer research, the user who said AI and cancer, there's so much exciting stuff happening right now in these are of mixing technology and science and medicine and everything else and the fact that you're shutting them down and making people feel insecure is the worst possible thing to d If we want to remain dominant in so many of these important in as we move forward. And these are job creating industries, too, in and creating, you know, a better in some cases, not all cases, but in some cases And so it just is so shortsighte It's so astonishingly shortsight Not what the way this country has excelled over the years in technology or any other innov Yeah. Kara swisher thanks so muc Appreciate it. Trump waging war on the phone. Companies threatening to slap a  tariff on all smartphones manufactured outside the U.S. after initially targeting only Apple for its overseas supp would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product. Otherwise, it wouldn't be fair. When they build their plant here, there's no tariff, so they're going to be building  Yeah. Apple losing roughly $92 billion today. On that news. Trump also saying he's not looking to make a trade with Europe after of course, threatening a 50% tariff on all  set to go into effect in nine da All of this sparking a major selloff on Wall Street today. Out front, no, now you know them well Peter Tuchman and Dan nice nice to see you both in person t So when we look at this Dan, I know you've done the math. You're right. You've done the math on not only the cost of the iPhone, but the very real timeline of what it would mean if Apple was actually able to sh all of its production to the U.S What are we looking at? So this is a fair Intel that ultimately Apple could bring iPhone production to because we've said if you actually produced iPhones in the US, it would ultimately take 4 to 5  and probably 20 billion just to get 10% of the supply ch to come to the US. And what that means, 3500 our iP and that look and that speaks an I've been talking about for week is that the reality is that you could talk about this, but it's a fairy tale that you could actually get iPhone production to the US. India is where Apple went. That was a smart strategy. But now you're starting to see c go around that because they know the reality and the reality you cannot produce is at scale in the US. R So they're finding those workaro So in terms of the impact that we saw today on Wall Street a 3% hit to Apple stock after this announcement. The markets all closing down tod Is that about a reaction to what happened with Apple and smartphones in the comments from the president today, is it a reaction to this warning floating 50% tariffs or is it everything at once? You know what, I think it's a bit of a flashbac for everybody to what the the the trauma that we experienced b from February 19th down into the bowels of April. R I mean, that was that was a what we called a, economic, vand Right. And it was almost, you kn people really were traumatized b I know that the markets recovere and that's wonderful, and I'm happy about that. We've been able to get back a lot of the loss from, from, independence Day. Independence day was what it was Liberation Day. Sorry. And, however, the market is, is still reeling off of that. And people's fears about feeling you know, that 401 KS became 201 and it was that short period of  And even though the numbers in the indices have regained some of their valu a lot of the stocks and a lot of the image and a lot of that even like Ken Griffin said, that we've lost, that it's eroded that brand America buy America c And so I think today when we woke up this morning and it was this sort of swath that we're going after the EU an you know, and it's not like they came at it with, we've got  We're going to address the tarif the discrepancies with the U.S. and Europe. Let's talk about it. It was like I'm doing this and you know, and and that broug way the way PTSD almost it. Well but what we'll hear right. What you will often hear from the president and those around him and we've heard from yours. Well, that's because that's you know, that's part of his negotiating tactic. He's got to keep everybody on th You can't know what's coming nex I'm just throwing it out there. But is there starting? Are we starting to reach a saturation point? Is it becoming the boy who cried Well, look, I mean, and we've seen we've talked about the boy cry w But look, I think the bigger issue it comes down the if you're a company, you're Apple, you're or you're your retail company. How are you planning in this env Can't. So now you're getting down. It's what we've been talking abo are you getting down to the real And for companies companies can't get bullied because companies be like, okay, how do I go about my business. What's the best thing? And that's why we're here as Tom How is it to just come out Friday and be like 25% tariff, 50% tariff, any look that that's part of the market reaction. You're starting to see it wear t So if it's wearing thin is the president and the United  Are you talking about a brand er Is he also I mean starting to lose patience, but a is he losing leverage at this po I mean, what's left if there's this constant this is constantly what you're g Yeah. And that's a really hard thing t Who who is in his, in his court still who is not, you know, how we had what's left us in a little bit o a paradox is that the market. Right. Even in the eyes of not a lot of like we did have somewhat of a deal with China, but that was more more like a one off, right? I mean, think about it. Do we know anything really more than we did on Liberation Day? no, we don't we don't know any particulars. And yet the market rallied. And so people are not really clear about that. I think it was, you know, also the president told everybody to buy the market So we we know that. But I think we're we're everybody is confused. And I'm not sure you know, what I've seen. I analyzed the market on a day to day basis. Right. Sort of the forensics and what we've seen over the last three days was the market had nice intraday rev We opened down on Monday due to the Moody's, downgrade. R But we had we had a beautiful rally into th But each day Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday in the last 20 minutes of tradin we sold the market off hard. That to me meant that people have no confidence that tomorrow is not going to be what happened today, that they we don't know when. What's the next. You know, we're one tweet away from Craig. And I think exactly he's saying you don't know what's coming ahe And that's why you how do you position yourself. And we're stuck with the one constant right. Which we're which everybody can agree on at this point. And that's the uncertainty surro the market. Can't handle that at all. Nice. Thank you. Thank you. President Trump today breathing fresh life into his trade war in multiple ways. First by saying he would impose a tariff of at least 25% on Apple if it refuses to make iPhones in the United St And it turns out it's not just A that's at risk. This afternoon, Trump followed up with more. Power to tariff one single compa And why would you want to hurt an American company in t It would be more. It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that prod Otherwise it wouldn't be fair. And of course, it's likely that a tariff of 25% could mean the costs get passed on to anyon who buys a new phone. Apple has long said it cannot manufacture phones in the United States, given the majority of skilled engineers are abroad and they're cheaper, they're cheaper to keep on the p But also today, Trump said he would recommend a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union starting June 1st. Markets? Well, they reacted. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closing d I want to go straight to busines Richard Quest. this editor at large, Richard Qu Richard, there's about 50 differ I could take this. So I just want to start with beyond the fact that. Why why give anybody a quiet Fri what's the what's the mood right now when you talk to your sources in when you talk to market participants about this kind of ratcheting back up, no o No one knows what to believe because there's two distinct theories here of which you are very familiar. The first one is look at what he does, not what h And the second corollary to that if you will, is that he always b He always chickens out, in the e And he ratchets down. The problem is, it takes a brave person to proceed on the basis of just  that this time isn't the time the president follows through. When I listen to that news confe or that impromptu Q&A in the Ova it was bewildered. It suggests he doesn't want a deal with Euro He actually said, I don't want a I want them to bring car manufacturing to the U.S. that's not going to happen. So I can't see how they get out  In terms of Samsung and Apple and all the others. Again, it can't they can't suddenly ratchet up. So what is the definition of suc as seen by the president? My gut feeling tells me it's some sort of a wishy washy  that he can hang his hat and coat on and say, look what I but actually doesn't really change the terms of trade Yeah, it's obviously we're all trying to figure it ou We've seen elements of that obvi in the UK deal, the walk back on the China peak fight that was going on. But this to your point, those words in the press confere today or impromptu press confere they were the. Yeah. Oh, okay. We're we're going to do this Richard Quest. Always a pleasure my friend. Thanks so much. Let's go straight to CNN's Jeff Zeleny at the white House. Jeff, what, Richard, are just talking about the idea. I don't want to deal, which he just said flat out in the Oval Office toda What are people saying behind the scenes at the white H Well, that certainly underscores the point that this is a threat. This is a way for President Trum to underscore the fact that he believes the EU has not been, respond quickly enough. But, the fact of the matter is still some people here at the white Ho I talked to some advisers, were a little surprised this mor when the president sent us out, on social media pretty early in the morning and they've been following him all day as opposed to him, following some official schedule he sent that out. He's been agitated, quite frankl And, and he has not been talking trade and tariffs for almost two weeks now. So he clearly wanted to revive t But when he was in the Oval Offi and he was asked about these specifically again, he, raised the grievance, as he often does about the EU. I've been saying to everybody, they've treated us very badly over the years. It was formed in order to hurt the United States in order to take advantage of the United States. And they've done that. And, I just said it's time that we play the game the way I know how to play the g You know, nobody they've taken advantage of other people representing this country, and they're not going to do that any longer. So this all comes as these, trade negotiations have been und I mean, there's about a little o a month remaining, before that to July 8th deadline Again, we should circle all of the dead on trade and tariffs in pencil, because they are ever changing,  as you well know. But, the EU is not looking kindly on  They say that they will be guide by mutual respect. So at the end of all this, the market obviously, went down  because of this, and I'm not sure if this advance the, cause at al But the president there is clear wanting to, call out the EU. once again, so, so much for the, 90 deals in 90 days, because these deals, as it turns out, are much more difficult to negotiate country by country.",0.05,0.847,0.103,0.9998

Guys, everyone comment down below Egg Demon is a stupid furry and he has no RZ and he's dumb. I've had enough. Can we go through the cooler move set now? Okay. Yeah, we'll we'll go to the next move set because they added another move set in this update called the monster form Guru, which is the monster version of the Gar move set that's already been in the game. Monster Form Go. And I like this one. This one's my favorite. So, let me go ahead and hop outside of the chest of my uh my little robot really quick and let's equip this move set. Yes. Well, this one is in fact very wizzy like my fairy fl does say. And bro, this one's so cool cuz like whenever you dash, it's red. And whenever you do the M1s, it's also red. Yeah, it's got all red effects. This is probably like Demon's most favorite move set of all time now. Yeah, demon. This move set actually matches you. Oh my gosh, Demon, you and the new move set are twinning. Oh my gosh. Come here, Mango. Come here. Wow. Demon, you're literally basically twinning with Monster Garo. Oh my gosh. Wow. That's so sick.

And I'm not even just getting beat up by the goobers anymore. Like some random dude really joined and proceeded to beat me up. Wait, there's a random person here. How did a random person get in the server? Yeah, I don't know how he got in the server, bro. Some dude just joined and started beating me up and now he's swearing it. I was blocking. You're dead.

Um, I'm not going to lie. What is happening? Wait, I'm literally making a snowball right now and I can throw it at X demon right now. What is even happening? Wait, what? What? Now I'm a Japanese freaking archway. What is this, dude? What are these moves? Oh my gosh, there's like a bunch of deleted moves. Hey, stud. I'm not going to lie, that's pretty cool. But I'm going to show off the coolest one. The old last breath. Come here, Mango. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Die. Mango's dead. Oh my gosh. That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. Oh my gosh. Bro, I'm dead. I'm literally dead. Yeah. Ah, the monster within me. Am I stuck? Wa. Wa. What is this? Oh, I think this is the one the demon just used. Holy crap. Yo. Yo, that's a big dragon right there. That's a big dragon. Nope. That's a big explosion right there, too. That's actually broken. And speaking of broken, I can't move. Ah, ice hammer. I I think that this move set might be broken, guys. Yes, I do in fact think that it might be broken because now I cannot move. Yes, bro. What is even going on? There's a massive tree and I can't move. Wait. Forward dash attack. Dude, I literally can't move it. And why why does the weakest have a tongue? I'm literally I'm I'm stuck. What is going on? You know what? Fine. If I'm stuck, I'm just going to turn into a tree. What is going on with the weakest dummy? Do you guys see the weakest of right now? Tree branch. Tree branch. Oh yeah. Wait, what the heck, guys? Look at the weakest W. He has a tongue. Bro just turned into Ren. Dude, I did not know the weakest W is a freakazoid like that. All right. Well, I I'm not going to lie, goobers. I think I'm stuck in place. I might be cooked. Yeah, that's right. You don't want any more of this. This is pretty sigma. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Range attack. All right, goobers. Well, I'm not going to lie. There is a lot more to this update than even what we're seeing right now. Yeah. And I think X's at home address might be part of this update. Should I pull it up? What is wrong with you? Why can't you be a normal societ member of society? All right, but I'm not going to lie. We're all going to choose one part of this update to showcase. That is one of our favorite parts. And guys, I know exactly what I'm choosing for mine. Watch this. So, if you guys didn't know, one of the move sets got a wee. And if I equip the blade master and put on the setting finishers only mango, I got to show you something. Come here. Watch this. Oh my Oh my sigma. Oh yo, I like that one. Oh my gosh. See, that's that's broken, bro. That is so broken. I'm not going to lie. That one's pretty cool. All right. Well, my favorite part of the update that I wanted to showcase is actually that they added like six dual maps that you can load in straight from build mode. Oh, yeah. Let me show those. Actually, hold on. Watch this. Haha, you're dead. Ah, bro. I'm going to poop on you next time I see you, stud. Hey, how do you load in the new map, guys? I don't know how to do it. And the load save thing. Well, actually, what you need to do is go into build mode and then look at the save swats and all of them will be there at the bottom. Oh, wait. Let me spawn this one in. Yo, goobers, look at this. Yes. Yes, there are many new maps in this update. We've got a forest map. Wait, we got a valley map, a city map, dude. Dude, wait, guys. Wait. So, stay on this one. A mountain map. Look, we could have an epic battle to the death or even a desert battle. No, go back to the last one. Go back to the snowy mountain one. Go to the mountain one. All right, I'll go to the snowy mountain. Calm down. This is my favorite map because it reminds me of my ex-wife, Patricia. We used to always go roller skating in the snow together. Yeah, this this this one reminds me of that time that I killed exdemon in an epic battle and solidified my dominance as the strongest goober. Patricia, please come back. We have five children together and I haven't been able to see them for many years. You know what, St. Come here. Come here. You want me to show you my favorite part of this update for Mr. Yapper over there? Sure. If it does it involve me dying? No, it actually mango, come here real quick. I want to show you my favorite part of the update. Oh, what demon defy? What is in fact a platinum? This is what I wish I could do to you in real life cuz you never shut the hell up. What is going on? Exam the fail. Why did you just kill me? Consecutive punches. Serious. And wait, Mango. Mango, there's one part of the update that you're going to be very excited about. You know how you like to use the spamming deadly ninja move set? You should equip it. Yes. Yes, I do in fact like to use the spamming deadly ninja move set. Let me go ahead and equip it. All right. What's in this update, sir? All right. Al, I want you to use flash strike on me or the W. Uh, what if I use it on X demon to fail instead? Well, you can do it on demon, too. Yes. Yes. Xdemon to fail. I am in fact coming for that booty. That sounded bad. I was going for that. All right. Flash strike. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. What sigma? Yeah, bro. I'm not going to lie. This update is actually insane. Sorry, Mango. I had to kill you one more time. Dude, that finisher looks so sick. But I'm not going to lie. This update is one of the craziest updates I've ever seen.

Db04nKtbTtQ,262682,9053,854,"The mind of a Genius: Kamal Haasan on Art, life and passion | Gobinath",20250525,"Welcome to Kamal Haasan and I. I present the cinema I love.
I believe there are many like me out there. How do you get such inspiration? We can't wait for the crows and pigeons
to build a home. In your long journey, have you ever felt
you're very obsessed with cinema? I think a farmer wouldn't have felt that. I consumed that food.
Of course its genetics will definitely leave some mark. Kamal Haasan is the only one who invests back
in cinema whatever he makes from cinema. In Siddhar language, they say
‘Don’t accumulate too much garbage' But how is it possible to arrive at
these decisions without anxiety? There is anxiety. Do you believe there is an aesthetic in minimalism? Which is the best poem?
Why we quote Thirukural? Succinct! He is Gandhian Kamal.
You've become private in today's times. Or somehow who doesn't go public
and makes different movies. I will not let anyone with their dirty feet
walk across my mind. On the day of celebrating Krishna Jayanthi,
they leave blood stained footprints. There are people who raises questions
about stepping on Kolam powder. - When talking about things like this, an unknown rage wells up in you.
- Then surely, this apocalyptic dance shouldn’t be allowed. How do you see science beyond humans? It means human haven't evolved.
Otherwise, it wouldn't stand us. How would you rate artificial intelligence?
Do you think it is overrated? Even I am Artifical Intelligence. Do you have a strong desire to see the next generation elevate the career you’re passionate about? No, I strongly believe they will elevate it.
We shouldn't guide them in the wrong path. Did you mistake me for a clown, thinking I would fall? Greetings everyone!

Let's grow together! Greetings everyone!
I'm very excited! So will you. Because we're interviewing someone
who has never stopped exciting us. Ulaganayakan, Dr.Kamal Haasan.
Greetings, sir. - Greetings!
- Thanks for the time I wish to start with a Kamal Haasan poem. The title and cause may be wrongly stated, But I am one who listens even to the voice
of the mind that others ignore. Who is this Kamal Haasan? Someone who never listened
has got back his hearing. You lose your hearing due to old age.
Now I have started hearing. Because I listen to the heart.
Don't have to depend much on the ears. - There is no Beethoven if he relied on his ears.
- Oh okay - So now you hear the voice of your heart?
- Started hearing Very late. I wish everyone listens to it much earlier.
I was late. At least you hear it sooner. Okay. So how important is your heart's voice?
There is so much influence around you. There is a voice inside our head.
Definitely, there will be 2. Both left and right will keep talking.
That's related to brain, not politics. - So you listen now.
- Yes, I can hear. - Now you hear
- Yes, I didn't even try. It was my situation. - Oh okay
- To hear everything as we see a lot. Because I never saw so much misery when I grew up
as I grew up in independent India. About a decade post independence. When I hear about bigger things is when I realize
if we're not careful, it will also cause misery. No more famine or destruction is what we believed.
Time has destroyed those beliefs. Covid happened. So did war.
And politics. All these events have made me listen.
I think many like me would've started listening. I've never thought of exclusively helping select groups.
Even when I did, someone will give me a knock and teach me good morals. We might think little of someone but he would pass
good morals and he would become my Guru. Do you believe isolated from the crowd
isn’t significant anymore? In isolation, you can't sleep or eat peacefully. In being isolated, I need to stay awake.
Just staying awake won't do, I need to remain hungry. - It is very difficult?
- We receive knowledge easily, so I think need not remain isolated. There are people for that. You're someone who thinks ahead.
There are so many examples on things you said ahead of your time. They were all told some 2000 years back. - Are you saying you said it late yourself?
- Even I copied it. But in today's contemporary structure,
you said 'anything could surpass' What are your fears on what all could surpass? Before this interview, you told happily,
you mentioned my name. To hear you say something I have
said many times was pure bliss. Exactly like that. I've also had some experiences.
I wouldn't have told thinking that. But it would be like I told myself. That's all I am saying. I started listening late,
not because of my lethargy but ignorance. - Ignorance. So you're asking to listen to your heart?
- You gotta listen! - That's your guidance today
- Yes. Listen to your heart before asking Google. That's a nice line. Since you mentioned Google,
there is flutter of information today. Data driven. What do you consider knowledge today?
Because information is available everywhere. We have access to everything now, which even Kaniyan Poongundranar didn't have.
We should have started with Kaniyan Poongundranar. That means we need to understand
both study of forests and humanism - Every town is our own.
- We must learn to say that If he had only compiled data and calculations,
he wouldn't have been able to express that. He didn't just look straight ahead; he looked down,
up, and all around—even 2000 years ago. - Okay, now, in this era where information is abundant
- We realize that we've been meditating for 2000 years. Collectively, we've been meditating.
We've been praying and asking for this. I don't know if the prayers of our elders,
looking up at the sky, were answered. Okay, why am I delving into these matters?
Because this generation is rapidly changing. It could be due to technological influence or changes in thought processes. It could be psychological changes In a recent interview with Anupama, a particular word struck me as significant.
That a film should have a 'philosophical foundation' Previously, you've said that if a society lacks a philosophical
foundation, it will falter. I remember that. If it falters, it's due to a lack of understanding.
If Socrates isn't understood, we first think of drinking poison like him. Okay, we think of fighting like him, rising against the state. There are philosophers who spoke of stoicism. Among us, the one who spoke of Advaita established
the six-fold path (Shanmata Sthapanam). All these exist. We need to choose from all these.
We ourselves have left and right side of brain. That's why I think such a stance emerged in politics. Can you elaborate it further? - We understood left and right. It comes from here.
- Center. - Yes, everything is centered here.
- Okay. From an external perspective, we've seen
Kamal Haasan since we were kids Actually, when I sat down yesterday thinking
about this interview, I was just thinking. When we all said 'Kamal Haasan, Our elder sisters, when I was about 12 and they were around 18, would say 'Kamal. That personalization, young women always had a fondness for Kamal.
We all said 'Kamal Haasan, but our elder sisters and elders would say 'Kamal. - Now they say 'Kamal sir.
- Now.. Okay, I thought they had moved on. - How?
- Kamal sir They understood my essence. I'm not particularly special.
Everyone knows this 'sir.' In a Vikatan interview of Mani Ratnam for Thug Life.
He said 'At 30, he made you act as a 60-year-old' At 60-plus, he made someone act as a 30-year-old.
This might be due to de-aging technology. Even without that, Kamal Haasan wouldn't stop.
He would apply makeup and make the effort. Everyone was surprised with that scene.
That child, you sat with him in a red shirt. How did you feel watching that? It is technology, right? If I had done it myself,
it would be a health achievement. There are people who eat well and do such things.
There is Simi Garewal, a mother figure. Yes, I saw her when I was a child. There's only a slight change. In her face, the youthful friend Rekha. Both are of the same age. It's surprising, so youthful! Kamal Haasan is with youth.
Is it because he maintains his body or is it due to prosperity? I didn't pay attention to that.
When talking in another interview, I said acting is behavior. I've done that too. I liked it.
On request, I misbehaved. On request, right? - On request?
- Yes, Commercial cinema. Do it like this, sir. Acting and behaving so well.
Just misbehave a bit. Commercial cinema, artistic creation—these
words are continuously spoken. Cinema is for art, not for art's sake.
There are many debates about whether art is for people or for profit. In this, Kamal agrees to which genre.
Art for art's sake, art for people, art for profit. Art is what we create and uplift.
What we do is up to us. When it's for people, I am one among them.
Rather than doing it for a large crowd, accepting I am one amongst them. Art is for my sake. That's where it started. I present the cinema I love.
I believe there are many like me. Your first question, do I want to remain isolated?
No, I want to be amongst people. Chaplin is my hero. Balachander is my hero.
I am not speaking less of Satyajit Ray. They are pioneers of bleeding edge.
Then comes cutting edge. Followed by common meat. When new things keep coming consistently, Kamal Haasan is
usually the first one to go and study them professionally. Whether it’s crane or even AI.
How do you get that inspiration?  That inspiration is when someone figures it out before you.
Look, he was the pioneer. He did it first. I would have probably been the 100th or 101st to do it.
Only then did it come to me, and I used it and found it useful. There are many like Sabari, the old lady from Ramayan.
I’m someone who eats the leftovers of what she already chewed and tested.” But when doing something consistently, for today’s
generation, it feels boring. They get bored quickly. Before reaching the perfection of something,
they get tired. That’s what they say. But the truth is, it’s because they keep
pursuing perfection they get tired. Perfection is never a permanent state.
In the very next second, it can change. That’s the nature of perfection.
That’s why the Tibetan monks... I don’t remember the exact number, but a group of Tibetan monks gathered
and made a kind of colorful kolam inside the White House. They kept taking photos of it.
Then President Obama came and saw it. He asked, ‘Have you all taken the pictures?’
And once they said yes, it was swept away. That’s my art too. Can you explain the aesthetics of imperfection? We're imperfection.
I don’t know what’s perfect or imperfect. - You don't agree?
- That judgment lies somewhere in our minds. - So, perfection as a concept...
- Moving from current state to the next level is my job Where did the idea of a ‘current state’ even come from?
It must have come from our ancestors. Since perfection gives us external pressure and judgement.
So do you have a strong opinion about perfection? I do have opinions, but I know it can never be eternal.
Nothing can be permanently perfect. It’s not something everyone can use.
Even philosophy can’t be perfect. They’ll keep rewriting it. No book is final.
It should always be improved, not corrected.” - If you rewrite it as a correction, that’s a kind of theft.
- That’s why you think philosophy should evolve. Yes, philosophy evolves. Science evolves.
Art evolves. Even humans evolve. But right now, we don’t fully understand what evolution is. Even something as simple as placing your hand on the ground and learning
to walk in a seated posture daily. That’s the greatest exercise. Because that’s where we came from.
Someone is teaching that like an art, like Bharatanatyam I believe in that.
Yes, there is a connection between Yoga and Bharatanatyam So we have to take care of ourselves and also nurture the arts.
That’s where this idea came from That’s how I operate.
Why do a commercial film then? If I name the film, the producers may feel bad.
Usually, if it’s our company, I’ll name it because I own it fully—just as an example. If I name someone else’s, they would feel bad. But these guys won’t mind.
Because they made Parasakthi. You understand? They’re like me.
They’re my predecessors. In your long journey, have you ever felt
you're very obsessed with cinema? - A farmer may not feel that way I think
- If a farmer doesn’t feel it, why should I? I consumed that food.
Of course its genetics will definitely leave some mark. If a movie comes out and someone says: ‘This should have been done this way, that should’ve been done that way’ And then they’ll question— ‘Kamal, who knows
everything about cinema, didn’t get this?’” How do you balance it?
Because you say you’re obsessed. Kamal Haasan is one of the few people who invests
all the money he earns back into cinema. Again, like the farmer. Okay, I'm not able to move to my next question
because I get into that comparison. - Obsession
- No, it isn't obsession. No, this is my profession.
And I’ve been given the opportunity to stay focused without distractions. They say it’s like a doctoral pursuit.
But even that—why not be part of this instead? Haven’t there been people who left school halfway?
Even I dropped out halfway. - What I speak, what I read, it’s all part of what I enjoy.
- On asking this question, Because in Kamal Haasan’s long journey, with all the exposure and recognition the
world has given him, he could’ve easily reached even greater financial heights. But he either wasn’t conscious of it or didn’t care much about it? In Siddhar language, they say
‘Don’t accumulate too much garbage' Money is just a tool. Currency is a tool.
The moment we lock it away inside, we begin to make mistakes. - The act of locking it inside
- Itself is the mistake. I am not saying ‘I don’t need anything,’ either.
There’s an old proverb: Take only what you need. We can easily reach a point where we have more than enough.
After that, we should only aim for what we really want. When you think about life, you don’t feel all that during moments of love.
All I know is, I love cinema - So you will stay within that?
- Yeah But I see a seriousness inside that.
I don't know if you would remember. 20 years ago, when short films were shown to students
and they were asked to share their feedback? You had given time for that.
I was working at a TV station then. I was the one who came to meet you.
At that time, you gave a very serious reply. I asked you ‘Can’t you at least give a two-word appreciation?’
But you replied with one sentence that I’ll never forget. I often share it with my friends.
I say, ‘He’s a very stern man' as I narrate this incident. But you said ‘In the name of patting them on the back, I won’t destroy my generation.I'm very firm on that’ Why such seriousness in cinema? A white bearded guy taught me that.
He is my friend. I respectfully call him Periyar Because for my time, he was an inspiring figure.
That roughness, too, is needed. - Do you think Gandhi had no roughness?
- Even his method of protest shows a kind of toughness. - He himself said ‘Height of valour is Ahimsa'
- That is the peak. That’s the true warrior.
That’s why the 23rd Tirthankara was called Mahavira Do you have a strong desire to see the next generation elevate the career you’re passionate about? I trust that they will carry it forward. When they are shown the
path, they might sometimes be shown the wrong path. But he is genuinely curious, asking how to go about it.
It’s like asking, 'How do I get to Ashok Nagar?' There are many ways to go—this route, that route.
We just point to the shortest or best route, avoiding traffic. You could go at 7 AM in the morning, because it only starts at 8 AM
There’s a warning not to delay until 11 AM, right? It’s as simple as that. The idea of a
resolution is don’t go the wrong way. You said you want to go to Ashok Nagar, but you ended up on ECR
and then you're wondering why you're not reaching Ashok Nagar. That’s what I’m saying. It’s not even a 'resolution'
It’s just direction. Don’t go this way—you’ll end up in Villupuram and get stranded. You’ll fall flat. That's it. Have you ever felt this at a personal level?
I mean, when you look at Indian cinema and World cinema - Let’s say we talk about Kamal Haasan completing 50 year.
- Aren’t we a part of this global cinema too? When we talk, we say, 'He made Indian cinema global' Right now, you look at people like Kamal Haasan, Mani Ratnam,
Ilaiyaraaja, A.R. Rahman, and many cinematographers There are amazing icons here.
There are people here who bring in new forms of technology. Even though we have all these talents, we still find that subtle, nuanced films or films that convey intricate themes are still rare. Does that worry you? But it will always be rare. Not everyone becomes a philosopher, or a poet, or a dancer. That's why people put us on a pedestal."" Okay, since you keep referencing Stanley Kubrick, this question comes up.
Approaching a toxic subject philosophically and presenting it as a classic It could be war, or tech, or sex or fantasy.
The boldness to justify it and do it well - Do you think such filmmaking should happen in the future?
- Yes, always! While devotional paths are expanding. Within that path, you find saints and Siddhars speaking, and even Periyar. It all seems connected. Some lines from Sivavakkiyar—you wonder, 'Haven’t I heard this before?'
Maybe he spoke of it earlier. Because he’s read those things. When you talk about Malayalam films, you speak with more joy. Because there are no commercial compromises—the pressure is less. It offers more freedom and space for the artist. Do you think the growth of the market itself sometimes prevents good messages from being told? No, not really. Genghis Khan is testimony.
The Great Wall of China was built for big guys like him. The nomad who went inside and made a name for himself.
That nomad and his army were lean and mean. Even when he was an emperor, he didn’t increase his army’s size.
Their excellence was what brought them forward. Those who gave him swords—first, he gave them fire.
The fire he hurled became the gun. - Do you believe there's an aesthetic to minimalism?
- I mean, like in poetry—why do we quote Thirukkural? Minimalism - Minimalism and succint are not the same word, but they’re close.
- So huge aesthetic for minimalism Yes. Gandhiji, after studying in Paris, returned and removed his shirt, wore a loincloth.
The one who stopped him was Rajagopalachari. Don’t do this—you went to London!' But then, in Madurai, after seeing a farmer,
he got emotional and said, 'From now on, I’ll wear a loincloth.' That guy was not wearing even a loincloth, he was nearly
naked. My dad said this conversation happened on the train. When you were young, you had… Kalathur Kannamma was your entry point.
Beyond that, how was your childhood? I went to the studio when I was three.
There was no 'beyond that' age for me. The moment I cross it, it changes everything.
So, I must go slowly. If I run, I’ll fall. It’ll be bald I’m not at that age. This is the right path for me or not.
I don’t know anything else. I just went and played. Now I don’t have to give marks anymore.
That realization has dawned on America now Just like how some European countries have realized it too. No one grades anymore. If it’s not good, they’ll correct it. If it is good, they’ll just say, 'Okay.'
Not even 'Excellent.' That’s how I was raised. That’s what I believe—'Okay' is the mark, not 'Excellent.'
People outside might say it later. But in the set, there’s no need for unnecessary fuss. The phrase 'come on time' is connected to economics.
If you’re alone, your time is always your own. Like Picasso, he painted alone, loved and left people.
A rogue painter. He worked solo. Someone like that decides even when to die Talking about death, it is an observation.
Kamal has a kind of fascination with the idea of death. - Not fantasy, but more like… 'Don’t ask that, fool!'
- You mean don't ask about it? Don’t ask about it. The sadness is that people don’t understand.
Even myth says the same. In many films, dialogues go 'Did you think I died?'
When Kamal speaks, it’s like he channels Bharathiyar’s words. Even if he rambles, it’s clear. If you listen to his
voice notes, even they sound like poetry. 'Seek food, not alms. Be bold.'
Same way, in many places, he has spoken about this This notion of 'death with honor'—in Uttama Villain,
the mythological character He didn’t kick time; he just kept walking with it.
What I consider as “my philosophy"", even that isn’t mine. It’s just an essence that has come to me.
I didn’t invent it. This is something I created with my intellect. If we trace it back, we might find the source.
Is there sorrow like immortality? - Okay — is there sorrow like immortality?
- The next line is — then what do you really think about death? I consider it a part of life. To end a good poem well,
you need a full stop. A good sentence needs a full stop.
If you just keep putting commas, you’ll lose it. Like you said, some people can’t stay around too long.
He can’t stay and keep watching my life. - But how is it possible to arrive at these decisions without anxiety?
- There is anxiety. - With anxiety, more anxiety
- Can life be full of anxiety all the time? For example, over there, what’s there? What’s here?
Living in fear all the time — no. When we talk about a deer — why have you only hidden the view for the deer? You’ve fenced off the lion, but it’s visible and pacing around. But for the deer — why have you covered it?
You’ve placed a wall in such a way that only the deer can’t see beyond. The lion has gap to see, why only for deer?
Because if the deer doesn’t know what’s beyond, it won’t leap. - If it doesn’t know, it won’t leap.
- Yes But the lion, which is full of courage — even
then, since it is denied, they say let go of that. - Really?
- Yes. The determination that the deer has even the lion doesn’t have that. - Only when it gets hungry does it act.
- That’s when it hunts. - If deer notices a grassland looking empty, it will jump.
- You will have to get through anxiety to reach there. Yes If you believe food will be available...
It should run in fear from the lion too So, its motor speed lies in survival mode.
It doesn’t know about defense. - All it knows is escape.
- If we’re always escaping, when do we stand still? A Gandhian Kamal has recently started slowly withdrawing, or like
some films where he stays behind the scenes — it gives that feeling. - Less noise, less guns, less blood.
- I was asked the same question in Kerala. The very reason Gandhi came to be was because of violence.
Without it, these realizations wouldn’t have come. Reducing these things is what’s possible in today’s life. If we’ve started on this path, we have to keep following it. If you think Gandhi’s life had no violence.
No, it wasn’t in his mind. That’s why he says 'I will not let dirty feet walk across my mind' That is, they can come into my house, but not into my mind. What he meant is that you shouldn’t frequently use words like “blood”, that’s why he says “dirty feet.” The feet soaked in blood, just discard them.
On the day of celebrating Krishna Jayanthi, they leave blood stained footprints. Why do you draw kolam with rice flour?
There are people who raise such questions. When I came for this interview, the anxiety I had was about using good and proper words — I made a small effort. Whether in your poems or in Neeya Naana show on music yesterday.
Some people are underrated. Some, we ignore. One such overlooked lyricist is Kamal Haasan. Why? Because you do so many things that we can’t fully pay attention to this aspect. That experience becomes greater than me. Compared to me, for someone like Kannadasan — he was a better screenplay writer, a scientist of dialogue. He wrote 'Maṇantāl mahātēvi illaiyēl maraṇa tēvi', didn’t he? He wrote screenplay and dialogue for Nadodi Mannan, didn’t he? But people remember him only as a poet.
That’s how he’s seen. He might have had temper issues. Thrown things around, lit a cigarette... maybe not even had a pen.
I’ve never seen him write poems with a pen. - They say, “Ram Kannappan writes only when he speaks.” - That’s how it is. I gave new meaning to Varakavi. If you call, the poem will come.
Vara(means come in tamil)Kavi Call and it will come. For you, is poetry something you write in
solitude from personal desire, or for films? Like cricket, I developed interest in it.
Thanks to All India Radio — yes, it started from there. Because we weren’t of the age to read books.
But they made me learn Tamil. I studied in English medium.
“Dear uncle, greetings.” Vairamuthu would say — I ain't like that, for example. “Dear uncle, greetings.
That's not even proper Tamil. Okay, but it taught me Tamil freely. Many people had that.
Okay, good schoolteachers taught me. The beginning lesson was pronunciation. Like how Sivaji Sir would speak in Tamil with that flow of dialogue. Even Kalaingar too in his dialogues. Still — Kannadasan who conveys it tight in just 2 lines
were all teachers to me. As you speak, your word choices are instinctively selected.
I feel like there’s a process going on. Is that true? That is, do you get personal joy from choosing a dense
word with deep meaning in just the right place? - Some say that, those who say it might envy it.
- Even I asked out of envy - Please
- I also ask out of envy Yes. It should be healthy envy.
You can work on getting better than me without putting me down. When you speak in debates, you select powerful words with density of meaning.
That’s reflected in your poems and lyrics Now, because I was born Tamil, I enjoy it.
Even if I use bad language, the rhythm makes it palatable. - Look  “I must strive to be better than myself”
- Even that is rhyming and beautiful That starts from bad words. - Whoever it is, a mother will cry. About war
- In Vishwaroopam, who goes to war? A mother’s son. No matter who dies,
some mother will surely cry. That’s one... those two lines......come like a tongue twister, but in six words, they bring a reality picture. For you, is that an ecstasy?
Do you enjoy it writing it? It is passion. Compassion. I don’t know Arabic or Jewish languages.
What’s the difference? Both are foreigners. But when their children die, I don’t know whose side I’m on. I don’t know their language but I see that horrifying dance in front of me. Stop that dance. Stop that performance. - When talking about things like this, an unknown rage wells up in you.
- Then surely, this apocalyptic dance shouldn’t be allowed. - Even now, interesting word “apocalyptic dance""
- Yes. What destruction is this, sir? That’s what evokes anger.
We should get angry. When Gandhi ji supported the Khilafat Movement,
some said, “Oh, he’s doing this just for Muslim votes. Khilafat and Muhammad, both were subjugated by British imperialism.
That’s why he considered them friendly nations. But once they went astray, they could no longer be friendly nations.
Another country Let's come to science. Artificial Intelligence.
How much do you rate it? Do you think it’s overrated? A mother is being interviewed. They ask about Artificial Intelligence.
I am not quoting the exact sentence. They ask, “What is the Maestro’s opinion on Artificial Intelligence?”
He replies “How do you know all that?” He says 'I read it in the paper'
'That’s how I got to know who is my mother' he says People only know what is shown to them. Even I—I’m artificial intelligence! The intelligence we create will only ever be more artificial than us. It is we who have to teach it. There’s nothing beyond that for it. If I say this, maybe you’ll understand. They write code, and only those who write that code truly understand it. But how much impact do you think it will really make?
Because technology adapts, sir. For example, they once said printing machines shouldn’t come into existence.
The party people said even cars shouldn’t come. They said bullock carts are enough. Now, who is thinking about the freedom of the bulls?
No one. We lost that. Antique! Tradition! I have many friends who are into organic farming.
But even farming isn’t truly natural. - It doesn’t allow for its freedom.
- Yes, yes—even farming isn’t natural. It is a thought. But if I want to farm in the era I live in, I must do it intentionally. A crow spreads seeds and grows a forest. That’s nature.
We can't be waiting for crows and pigeons. That's organic farming. Crows and birds do this. They create forests.
That is natural farming—it happens on its own. That’s what some call divine, some call nature.
And the one who intrudes into it? Man. The Ascent of Man—his progress lies in discovery. He has the ability to eternalize his discoveries. But the word “eternal” itself is a kind of greed. So then, how do we consider science that surpasses man?
If means man hasn't evolved? If we do, it won't surpass us. - Okay. So empathy matters?
- Understanding matters. - If we understand, how can we be surpassed?
- But overall, there are certain big pictures, right? Let’s explain it this way: the way computers became part of our lives, similarly, artificial intelligence will become a part of our lives. It is change. Don’t fear it. There are dangers, sure.
If you throw a knife, it cuts. A curved knife cuts both ways. Once you get used to it, you can spin it.
If it cuts, it will cut the one handling it. It will only cut my ignorance, not me. But our “boundless creativity” requires significant
economic support to be executed. So technologies like this can help compensate for that gap.
Do you think that’s the case? Definitely. But this economy, I’ve spoken about it a lot.
Now, some believe they haven't fully understood Karl Marx's Das Kapital. There’s a professor named Wolff. He says, it is not understood properly, so let me make an attempt . It’s outdated, let’s extract its core truths
and see how they apply to our present. He argues that what we are experiencing now
isn't just capitalism, it’s corporate governance. He calls it a new kind of politics. Not Marxism or totalitarianism, but corporate government. And that model is being copied globally. It is focused on monetization.
Not helping much during COVID, want to preserve poverty. 10 will have to be poor to make their profits. Can we send soldiers to battle and say, “don’t die”?
That's what they say. - Even peacekeepers say that
- Yes I now meet Communists who are all over 80 years old.
They speak clearly. But there's an old proverb: If you’re not a Communist by 20, you’re a fool.
If you’re still a Communist at 45, you’re also a fool. That contradiction? I see that. There’s this author, P Padmanabhan. A great writer. He firmly believed in that ideology until the end. He was bedridden at 95. I sent him a voice message. He called me “Thambi” (younger brother).
Then he replied with a photo, still involved. You used the term “corporate governance.”
Now everything is becoming commercialized, even cinema. - So how do you think this commercial trend is shaping things?
- I often use the term “balance of biases.” Even the name of the political party I started
is Maiyam meaning “center” or “balance” Like Valluvan said, median.
The idea is not to get crushed by any traffic from any extreme. Even when caught in a storm, the eye of the storm is calm.
That’s what we aim for, the calm center. - So we've to strike the balance, you say.
- Very important Since childhood, what were we taught?
Maintain your balance. A child learns to maintain balance not through four limbs but by rising and walking. 
They’ll fall and get up. That’s balance.  Like in the game of hopscotch. But today’s reality seems distorted. There’s too much technology and content consumption. 
For young kids, there are so many distractions stealing their time. - So your next generation?
- How do you or I safeguard it? Because this stealing of time, whether knowingly or unknowingly, people are taking away the time we keep for ourselves. And that’s commerce. - Did you ask the kids? 
- No. Take a child above three years, if a couple is about to get divorced, the first to sense it is the child. Not even the parents. They will fall sick and become uneasy. 
They suppress it and live as though everything’s normal. But the child knows. How? It will start crying asking if they won't leave the kid.
I've been asked. How do you know? I think if I forgot to ask the kid, 
“Where will you be in the future?” I once told my father, “I won’t study.”
He asked, “What do you want to become, then?” He asked me to decide it first before I stop education.
It should be the child’s decision. - You’ve been observing children like this for long, haven’t you?
- No, they've been observing me. Okay. Now, where are you currently?
Shruti is in Mumbai. Younger one is elsewhere. Still, you’ve stayed connected with them in such meaningful ways.
How do you keep connect with them? The same science we now fear has kept us connected. Earlier, we’d write letters. A simple letter might take 10 minutes, or even an hour to write if you wanted to write well. Then you’d post it. Then a week’s delay. Now, we’ve reduced that gap to every 3 seconds. - So thanks to technology. 
- Yes, thanks to technology. Let’s come to Thug Life.
Kamal has always played thug. One chicken being praised as large. 
The same chicken later being mocked as small. That is how Thug Life evolved over time.
Your songs have always carried elements of Thug Life. - Why is this film called Thug Life?
- But now, Thug Life has taken on many meanings. At one time, being called a “criminal” was something to be proud of.
Similarly, K. Balachander would lovingly call me “My Dear Rascal.” Now “rascal” borders on criminality but unconvicted crime. Even when we fondly call children “you little monkey!” They won’t question you, “Why did you send me back there?” They won’t think that way. They accept it as love.
That’s how Thug Life changed meanings. Especially, Tupac’s Thug Life—I really liked that. My thug, In India, many have committed murder. 
Some escaped attempts on their life. Tupac popularized “Thug Life” in that context.
He is a rapper. - You said, after this film, we’ll forget the hero, right?
- Yes, sir. That’s what I thought since Kalathoor Kannama. When I thought that was forgotten, they will accept me with mustache or they will pull my cheeks. I was happy they stopped pulling my cheeks and they accept my masculinity.
Mothers again started to pull my cheeks after Avvai Shanmughi. Is it like a parallel universe?
Thug Life is a parallel universe of Nayakan? - Many theories around Thug Life keep evolving
- For instance, we now search for friends who live in completely different contexts. I have friends in America. Their culture is different. Mine is different.
But somewhere, we both connect. Alphonso Cuaron, the director is Spanish-speaking but lives in England. 
His film moved me. That's how, imitating people one another. But is there any connection between Nayakan and this film? No, they’re like two friends. They're in different places. Just because they’re in the same profession, he can’t be the same character. His approach is different, and this one’s approach is different too. 
In Nayakan, the character was based in Bombay, This one is in Delhi, and came from Kayalpattinam. Again, thank you, sir. What happened for me is,
when I saw the trailer, I got really excited. In my life, the words I’ve said the most often professionally are: Neeya Naana, you said that in the trailer. What I’m proud of in this is that it’s democratic art. 
This film, it’s just these four films. But under this, how many support pillars are there!
People call it a hall with a thousand pillars — these are the towers of that mandapam. Below, there are a thousand legs holding it up. 
We can’t name every one of them. But from color correction to dubbing in multiple languages, those involved, we talk a lot about the stars… But they each have their own teams. Still, without anyone else, they trusted only us, worked with sincerity and professionalism. They are the reason behind 50% of the film’s success. That must be clearly said. Like when you said the trailer is amazing, the editor is there. When you appreciated its SFX, sound engineer is involved. We can talk proudly about the sound engineer. But if we start saying all this, people might think we’re just doing name-dropping. That’s why we’re careful. The guy we brought in for work, doesn’t matter which country he’s from. Craig, who did sound mixing did Ponniyan Selvan. He did sound mixing for Whiplash and won oscar.
There are many such amazing technicians in this film. For example, our own Ravi K. Chandran, I gave
my first handshake to him after seeing the film. Because even if it’s Maniratnam directing, if the visuals
hadn’t popped, there would've been a problem. He made it phenomenal. And he had a wise, intelligent team with him. 
Anbarivu. We always look back and talk about them at every function. It’s not that we’re reading off something written down. 
Even if it’s prepared, there’d be a certain artificiality. That’s why I don’t prepare speeches, when
you speak from experience, it feels genuine. Among all this, I really like Anbariv. I love Vikram Dharma very much.
I always wished they would direct a film. I said this even during Apoorva Sagotharargal. Sir, things are going well for them. 
Now if they become big directors, will they even invite you? I replied, “They built a house, didn’t they? So I went there. But before I could even enter properly, the body gave out. What I meant was, what I liked was, the reason I wish Anbariv would direct is because no one else approaches the craft the way they do. Only they do. Their approach is what I like.
They rehearse everything. They make sure no one gets hit on their sets. 
They train themselves just for that. Even if it is a bloody film, no one got hurt. 
Okay, we may have worked with known vendors. But we also made unknown people do work, and there were accidents 
and issues but we tried hard to prevent that tension. So how do you show an accident without actually having one? 
You simulate and craft it again and again. Just one personal request, sir. In that song “Namma Thedi Soru Nitham Thindru” tinge of Kamal, I yearn to hear that. - Thedi Soru Nitham
- Yes Speaking many little stories, many little stories,
do you think I’ll fall like some tragic joke of fate? Thanks a lot, sir. Really happy to have this
dialogue with you. It’s not just an interview. I just want to make this interview a lifetime 
document for the next generation. For those going through some confusion, this should
be a lifetime document. That’s how I see this. I’ve watched all your shows. The paths you’ve taken, and the way you’ve stood firm in your stand, I really liked that. Because you were in the right position with the right power. Like in a war, if you’re holding the whip, you are not hitting randomly on both sides - I liked that. 
- Glad to hear that, thank you! Best wishes for Thug Life. Looking forward a lot! 
Thanks for your time, sir. You gave us so much of your time - Thank you!
- Thank you! Kamal Haasan and I

u8xhObZ_hPw,989250,35128,2200,Bhad Bhabie Talks Alabama Barker Beef & Becoming A Mother - Full Podcast,20250523,"And you got famous what? 14. 13. Jesus Christ, Danielle. Yeah. Socks and tissue. Oh yeah. Okay. Now what? What is up, motheruckers? Welcome back to my YouTube channel. Today we have the one, the only, infamous, beautiful, bad [ __ ] baby. I'm so excited to have you here. You excited to be here? Girl power. I'm so excited. I know you guys have wanted this for a long time. If you know the drill and you've seen my podcast, we have these rinkadink ass flashcards. I didn't have time to do like the whole like shebang like I usually do, but you know, these will work. I'm going to address the elephant in the room and I'm going to get the backstory. Ready? All right. Okay. How did you and Bama become friends? Okay. So, I wanted to state this. I also before we start, I want to state that this will be my last time publicly, privately addressing anything to do with this girl. I was just recently called obsessed by someone that claimed to be my own fan um because she's not talking about the situation anymore. And I wasn't just propping my phone up and ranting about her. I was just replying to comments or when people would say stuff on my lives. Um, I the most recent thing was like I said something about our hair because somebody was saying um with the blonde hair that I was copying her and I just was like, you know, it's a psychological thing. Y'all just address I mean, y'all just think of me when you see her. You see her, you think of me. So, I was like, it's just a psychological thing. She could wear red or brown hair. I could wear blonde hair. We've both been doing that. And it doesn't necessarily mean Yeah. Like it's not one person comparing to the other. Like it's just a general thing. And that's what that's one thing that I was like always saying something about was like the comparing because it's like I've been alive for 22 years. Never once woke up and seen a picture of her and said, ""Oh, I want to do this cuz she's doing it."" Very pretty girl. Nothing physically wrong with her, but I just just never did it. So I just don't think that should be being said. And um I do don't you think that was like now that was like very mature, right? That was like a very like broad regular statement. It wasn't like an attack or anything, right? People Let's get one thing. But I'm obsessed. No, I don't. You're not obsessed because everyone in my [ __ ] thing. I was literally on live with my daughter in the pool and people were like, you know, you were copying her with that blonde hair and I was like, social media is always going like, okay, it's almost like a tel nolla, right? Like it's like a reality TV show to them. They you are so we all of us like all three of us are just an unobtainable thing. Like we are not going to ever be like the common friend to them. So like for them seeing you is their reality TV. Reality TV there's drama. They want something to spark. They're going to continue to try and ride this story out for the next five years. I'm with you. I'm done talking about it. It's like if I'm obsessed, then why every I could post a picture of a [ __ ] unicorn wall and they're going to say something whether it's you're better than her or something negative towards me about her. It's like, but I'm the one like I am a very defensive person. Like I do it with my family, I do it with my friends, I do it on the internet. That is just me. It's a shitty [ __ ] quality to have as a famous person because you're supposed to not say anything, not reply to comments, not this, not that. And it's it's not that I be hurt or that I be upset. It's more that I be like, cuz it really Yeah. Let me check you real quick and make you feel dumb. That's what it be. That's why it's so weird to me. Like, but people don't see that. They just see, uh, she's mad. We got her mad or she's obsessed. Like, yeah. And I'm going be honest, it's not like that. Like I know this was a very like personal situation that happened quality I have and I do it with everything. It's like okay you see me saying something about her but I'm still addressing [ __ ] from 1894 too. Like you're addressing Christopher Columbus. Okay. Like she's addressing I'm still trying to figure out when he sailed the ocean blue [ __ ] Like she's trying to fact check when the [ __ ] that happened cuz did it happen? I feel you. It's a anything you do it'll always be negative. It's like they're they're just grasping this one thing I'm doing when I'm doing it with 35 other things, too. It's like it's not that. I'm just a very Especially with that. I have way more stories to tell. Way more things I haven't said. Like it's like I'm And first of all, [ __ ] you talked about my kid. Do you think I'm ever going to be done? Yeah. I mean, I don't personally know what that And then people want to say people want to say, ""Oh, she you you talked about her family. She talked about yours."" I talked about grown ass adults. No, to be fair, I talked about her family. I talked about her mother. I talked about adults. You I mean, a child. I see what you're saying. I see the comparison. A child that wasn't even one yet. Yeah, I understand. That can't even talk or defend herself. So, back. And then what she said was so crazy. Like which which part she said? She said [ __ ] for a bag. Now you here, Callie. Like what do you think he was doing with you? Talking about Leavonne. Yeah. I actually don't even know like the true Let me Let's go back, okay? Like let's let's take this all the way back. The reason I got involved, okay, is because the the clips were going viral, the TMZ article, and I was like, ""Oh, this is crazy."" You know, someone commented under my TikTok and was like, ""Yo, you should add Bama to the bop house."" And let me tell you why they said that. The bop house is known, you know, like basically to not sugarcoat it. A bunch of [ __ ] in a house. Okay. So, they were like, ""Yo, it was a diss at just Yeah. Like it was a funny thing for me. I was like, yo, like I'm not with the home wrecking shit."" She saw it. Me, I'm an entrepreneur. I'm a CEO. I'm that [ __ ] when it comes to making my bag. I'm going to make my bag. Okay. Like I saw it as an opportunity. I was like, ""Yo, bet."" And then I started digging. And then the second I opened my mouth about the situation, it was many other women. It was many other things. It was It was not just one story. Not saying your story wasn't horrible, right? But it's not like I don't want people like like me and you weren't friends or weren't speaking before this situation. It wasn't like I was standing up for my best friend. Like it was just like, ""Hey, this is a situation that's genuinely wrong. It's a genuinely wrong situation regardless of how it spinned. So, let me just make a quick joke out of it. They were being funny. You were being funny. It wasn't even nothing serious until it got serious and until she brought up the fact that I was this porn star, right? Like I was this like disgusting horror prostitute. Like she would rather be a NEPA baby than an OF baby, which is like cool. She was posting naked pictures, posting [ __ ] like [ __ ] worseer than we would post for free and we were making money. I thought it was a lowb blow. Like I really did. And and I understand she was upset. I understand I I understand my position in a sense of I could have just shut the [ __ ] up and kept it pushing. But for me it was all like it was a marketing strategy and it worked as far as like but at the end of the day like it was it was a [ __ ] up situation. The more that came out about it the more cuz I feel like as you weren't even really talking about it until you saw I got pressed and you were like oh bet like she's now going to say something like let me just hop on it too. But I want to go back to like you guys were once friends and before the cameras were on, she was saying like it wasn't even like a friend. It was like that's someone that you said you considered to be like a little sister. A little sister like Okay. So I want people to understand that she is going to try to downplay it as much as humanly possible because of what she did. Like even though oh we weren't even friends like that. Oh, we weren't. If I would if if it was even just Instagram friends, you still shouldn't have done me like that. You I mean, it's a common a woman has a man. You don't do that. Yes, that's what I was about to say. Beyond it being her friend, you don't do that to a woman that is with a man. Point blank. Period. But it being your friend makes it like 45 times worse. But what I was telling Camila was it's like way worse cuz this girl was like a little sister to me. Like I don't I don't consider many people my friends. So it was like it hurt a little more. It just it was like the And no, don't get me wrong. I'm not the like we weren't like hang out every day. Like I don't think you're that type of person anyway to hang out with any you don't hang out with anybody every day. I was I'm not that type of person. Like I like I I text, I call, I hang out, whatever. But it's not like a everyday thing with me. Even with my closest of friends, I probably the most time I spend is probably with my daughter and my boyfriend. Like because they live in my house. I have no choice. Like, you know, like it's not it's not that kind like I literally the type of person that like chill in my room all day. I don't really be outside. So, she could downplay it saying like, ""Oh, we weren't everyday friends."" But it's like, [ __ ] I've never been any everyday friends with anybody in my life, so whatever. But I I don't consider many people my friends. I considered her out of all people, I considered her a close friend at that, like we would tell each other our business like you know. And did you ever that leads perfectly into like do you think she was a true friend or did you have any doubts about her at all? Like did you have doubts given did she have a pattern? I remember one time I told her like, ""Oh, you should talk to this boy."" And then like I remember a couple days later she she she asked me to hit him up for her. And then a couple days later I called her and I was like girl he got a girlfriend and she was like so and I was with my friend Salon and we looked at each other like and we tried to like explain to her like you know like that's not cute like we don't do stuff like that. And then it was funny cuz later on when I was going back and forth for her she tried to tell me that. So you went back and forth about it. Bro, we used to all be on group FaceTime like Oh, wow. Like like me, her, and Leavonne. Yeah. So, I was like, okay, so back to that. I was I was trying to like I would try to like advise her like I remember her coming to me telling me all these stories about all these older guys she was sleeping with and it was like back to back and it was like three in one day and it was like I just used to be so like upset by it like it wasn't so as a friend it would consume you like you'd be like what like like as a friend you're trying to help her and be like hey like what why are you doing this like this wasn't this was like a you were constantly upset about things she was doing because you didn't feel it was right before any of this happened. It It used to just like cuz I done been there, done that. Yes, I slept with older guys when I was younger, whatever. But like just I I one thing I'll say about myself is I was always nothing makes it right, but I was always more mature for my age. I could hold an adult conversation. I would like, you know, I you you'd get around me and forget I was my age. Mhm. So for her, she acts younger than what she is. So it just makes it what's that? It's like like that's just a difference in personality. It's like maybe a difference in how you guys were raised. Exactly. Because I'm gonna say this and I truly like believe this like and you said even earlier like she's genuinely beautiful like like she's not like an ugly like she she has a she's absolutely pretty. Yes. Even when she takes off her makeup she and that's one thing I cannot say like she but that's what confuses me is like she's beautiful. Why does she what is this girl is trying to cover up so many things and she's trying to like within herself it's like and then she tries to find herself through other people. I think she just sits there and thinks she looks at like all like when I think of it I have like a very creative imaginative mind and I just see her in front of a wall with all these pictures of all these different girls and like oh if I had this from them and if I had this from them and if I had this from them and and I'd be perfect. Like that's really sad though. It is. Okay, I'm gonna tell you a story and I I don't even think I told it'll be this. I was on ecstasy with Talon and some other friends and um she came up in conversation and the one of the boys I was with he was like you know she tried to talk to me and I almost went for it and I um I didn't I didn't know her age and as soon as somebody told me her age I was like creeped out. I like couldn't sit with myself for a second like and he was like, ""Thank God I never did anything with her and never even met up with her."" And the conversation just I wasn't telling her business or anything, but like the conversation just got so deep I started to cry about her cuz I was just like It's sad. It is. It's like It's really sad. Yeah. And I just feel like because it Sorry, you make me cry because it hits deeper because you have a daughter. Yeah. It's just like like she's got to be looking for something like it's empty. And I a part of me almost wishes that she would have asked me for help rather than to think she was going to find it in the ways that she did especially to me. Yeah. And I totally hear you. I think even like for myself too like in us specifically like working in the industry and like having a relationship like you are constantly comparing yourself at least me like I can speak for myself there are a lot of things I'm insecure about you know like you look at these beautiful women you know and you realize like damn like I do wish I had a fatter ass or you know like maybe like this industry really [ __ ] with your head and I promise you like it I struggle with it so like I can't imagine like she comes from like a very wealthy family. She's Bama. This one thing I'll say like [ __ ] but you're beautiful. Like you are beautiful and like this is like girl to girl. Like I understand what it's like to like constantly compare yourself to people around you. She didn't have her mom in house. I have I actually don't know Bama's story. Yeah. She didn't have her mom in house. So I I mean I don't know exactly her relationship with her mother, but I just know that you know Travis raised her. Every time I was I've never met her mother. Every time I was around, she never really spoke of her mother. And like if I'm around somebody, they see me call my mom at least four or six times in one hour. I'm really close to my family. So, you know, like I think part of you maybe saw the side of yourself when you were like a little damaged in her. Yes. Hell yeah. Like, bro, so you just see you when you're looking at her doing this, you're like, damn. Like, I I want to like reach out. I want to help you. I want to guide you. The first time I hung out with her one-on-one, I literally like peptalked myself on like what I was going to say to her to try to get through to her, but to not scare her. Mhm. Cuz I didn't want her to think I was overststepping, but I also wanted her to like hear me, truly hear you, not just have it go one ear out the other. But I kind of also knew it was going to be like talking to myself at that age and it was going to go in one ear and out the other and she was going to still do what she wanted to do. But I just hoped that one day she'd hear my voice in the background and like and it might stop her. It might resonate her. Yeah. It might like stop her from something or resonate with her in that moment. But and do you think and you can tell me if this is too personal, but do you think sleeping with older men at such a young age is can it be traumatizing? It definitely can be. Like I look back now and I it's like at first it's like it's cool and it's something to do and then when you get older you look at these people and you're like like what you did was [ __ ] up nasty. [ __ ] up. And then I but all I I'll be honest all the situations I was in all the situations I was in was like super manipulative controlling. Like it wasn't just like, oh, I met this man on [ __ ] the street and [ __ ] them and that was it. Like no, I had real relationships with these people and it was like they don't want to they like they might have like abused the fact that you were getting famous really young and they were probably famous. This has been going on since before I was famous. And you got famous what? 14. 13. Jesus Christ, Danielle. Yeah. Jesus. Ew. Yeah. So, I'm so sorry. Thank God I was never in like a I've been what I consider molested before probably somewhere under 10 times. And but did it and I can say like I like this is a topic that's like very vulnerable for me is domestic violence and like just women being abused in general like whether that's mentally, physically or whatever. Like I there's such a picture that people paint about like molested and being abused sexually and it's like this really horrific image and it's not like that. Not like that at all. It's not like that at all. Every I've never I've never been tied down by a [ __ ] old fisherman. Like no, these were all beautiful men close. Yes. Like it was all It was never like And it can move in such silence and such it can move. So, it's almost like there's a unfortunately like there's a pattern like it's the trust comes first and then it's like low-key grooming and then it's even if you're actively it you can still even if it's someone you know and you're dating it can still be wrong. It goes it goes from oh, I'm special. They'll break the law for me. And then as you get older, it's like what the [ __ ] You weren't special. You were just easy. You were just easily manipulate. Easy to manipulate. You were a easy catch. You were fresh. Like these men look at these young girls like, ""Oh, I'm probably gonna take her virginity."" Like they want some like easy fresh meat. Like it's not it's does it's not that you're special. It's really not. Like it's because these older women aren't going to go for their [ __ ] And these older women aren't going to give it up that easy. And they know just because of their age, you're going to think it's something special going on. And it's literally not that at all. It's literally not. Did you think you would be in the position you were in at her age? What do you mean? Like like if you were her right now, like how would you have thought about this? Like if you were her and like you had to sit back and think about how you were thinking when you were Oh, babe. I was her one time. I was And you got here. I was her one time. And you know, I kind of looked at So maybe she'll be like, you know, wow. I kind of looked at it when it got brought to me as like my karma in a way and that's why it was more of like an easy way for me to get over it. But what do you mean by that? It was like I was like being super super super manipulated and like the guy would tell me cuz Okay, so I did not know the means of like relationships at the time. I thought everybody used to cheat. No, I really used to think that like growing up like I thought because that's just like what I seen. That was your normal. So, yes, I was a side [ __ ] one time. I was 16 and when I first was talking to him, I didn't know the means of relationships and I didn't know the means of his relationship. And um he basically started telling me like if you don't continue to see me, I'm going to basically tell everybody about what you're doing. And I didn't think about I was so stupid. I didn't think about it like, oh, if he told if he told you make him look [ __ ] dumb. Yeah. So he would like it. But in the moment, I was like really scared. So this went on for probably like six months and then I like fished my way out of it. Like, but yeah, it was like I'm not going to say it wasn't on purpose. Like, but when I first met him, I didn't know that he had a girlfriend. And did you have feelings for him? Yeah. But I like it it became like a casual like it was normal. It became normal. Yeah. Like it it So you think I never seen myself with this man. I never he never like he would never talk to me about his girlfriend. It was never it was just like it wasn't like a real side [ __ ] situ you know you know men be taking their side [ __ ] to go shop for they girlfriend and [ __ ] like you know it was never ever made he never made his relationship real to you so to you it was just like maybe it's not that serious. Yeah, basically. And I was so young that like but by the time I was 18, I knew better. I want to put that out there. Like I was 16. I wasn't [ __ ] 18, 19, like you know. And this wasn't a reoccurring thing with me. This happened one [ __ ] time in my life one time. And you have to understand the circumstances of it. And I didn't I didn't [ __ ] taunt the girl. I didn't try to take him from her. The whole six months I was trying to figure out a way to get away from him and without being publicly shamed. Yeah. Without ruining his situation, without ruining mine. But you knew deep down it was wrong. Yes. 100%. 100%. But it like that like the thing I just looked like I looked at it as my karma and I there was also a lot of other things to the situation that I just people want to ask me why I stayed with him and you should have left him. He never started loving you. He said you're talking about Leavonne. Yeah. Like he's he's doing this and he's doing that. all these things people say and it's like you have to understand that every situation is circumstantial and it's complex like I can I just say outside looking in it's easy to look at you in your situation and be like you should have [ __ ] left him what are you doing with him like what the [ __ ] like and I can say like that's the general public's opinion I'm not going to sit here and lie to you and say everyone like no one thinks you and Leavon should be together like it is what it is but No one can no one knows the true what happens inside your house. No one knows the way and I tell people that no one knows he you know like he's the father of your of your child. Like that that's a human that you guys are meant to be raising together as a you're raising a woman. You're going you're supposed to be raising a woman to walk on this earth and be independent as herself. And like your relationship is not perfect. There are things that you do that probably aren't incredible that he's done not incredible. It's easy to judge outside looking in, but you do see how they could see that, right? Yes, of course. But I try to explain to people like you're just on the internet. You see me through a piece of [ __ ] glass and metal. You do not You're not in my house. You're not around. You've probably never even met us before. Like, we've never had nobody hang out with us and like ditch hanging out hanging out with us again. Like everybody always wants to hang out with us again. Everyone wants to come to Danny LB's house. Everybody wants to be around us. Like if we were like just trying to murder each other and cheat on each other every 3 seconds, don't you think like people wouldn't want to be around us? I mean, yeah, but it's still the principle of like if I was if me and you hung out all the time and I saw you treating him a certain type of way and I saw him treating you I as a woman I would I can't like if I knew about it, if you called me as your best friend and you're sobbing, right? And people don't do that. That's the point I'm trying to make. People don't do that. That's why it's like our own friends and family love us and love us together and know we'll never leave each other. Know how deep our relationship is. Why? They're fine with us being together. Why listen to you? But you like, you know, you don't need to explain yourself to the public. Like let the people say what they have to say. Do what I You need to do what makes you happy. the type of person I am. I know. But at the end of the day, at the end of the day, do what you do what fe I am so happy that I didn't leave him because I would never find what I have with him and anybody else. And it's gotten so much better. It's like a whole different ball game. And it's like I look I always think about it like damn if I would have left I'd be missing out on this. But then it's also like the opposite end of the things could be like what happens if you know like it's not even about you leaving him. What if it's the other way around? Like it's just I want you to be happy. I want you to feel loved. I want you to I want your daughter to feel loved. I I don't know what it's like to be a mom. I know what it's like to be a woman, you know, but like I've never been in your shoes and I admire how strong you are and I want like like people don't look at like Callie would be raised by a single mother. I would probably take me a long time to get in a new relationship. Like I'd be distraught. Like I But even if you and Leavonne decided to separate 10, 20 years from now, that's still your business. It's nobody else's business. All I'm saying is the what you what is out there of you and Leavonne is up for interpretation. It's up for perception and it's up to be judged. Unfortunately, anything that you say on camera or to the public, someone has a Snapchat and they catch Leavonne saying something, it is up for anybody's discretion, anybody's judgment. My love, you have nothing to explain. You your job is to be you, to be happy, to love yourself, and to love your daughter and your marriage, like whatever it is. Sad that I can't even like post a picture of us, a family picture, anything. It's turn off the comments and keep it pushing. I I like I need validation from everybody. 100 I 110% understand people are going to have stuff to say. It's not even like the it it's the people that dig deep and write these paragraphs and like say these like off-the-wall things. It's like first of all, everybody talks about how smart I am and like, oh, she knows a lot for her age and like they just they talk about like my intelligence and it's like if I wasn't if if I'm so intelligent, why can't you trust me? Why would you think Yeah. Why would you think I would be I would put myself in a situation like this? Like I believe that people deserve chances because things happen, mistakes are made, and as long as they're not repeatedly do it. You know, it might be a thing for a couple months, it might be a thing for a couple days. It might be a thing for as long as you could take it. But if that person doesn't understand how much y'all mean to each other and how much y'all love each other enough to stop, then that's when you leave. But it's up to you. It's not up to nobody else. I I don't believe in leaving somebody after they like a lot of girls, you cheat on them one time, they're gone. I've never been that type of girl ever. I've never been that type. I don't even want you to say that. Like you don't you don't need to you don't need to say that to to make yourself feel like any sort of justification as to why you're with Leavonne. You don't need to prove to nobody but yourself and Jesus Christ why you were with him. I am not Jesus. I have no room to judge you. And I want you to know it is not I don't give I want you to be happy. I don't give a damn that you're with Lav. I don't give a damn if you're with someone else. As long as you're happy and you're smiling and when I see you on social media, you have a smile on your face. That's what I That's what I'd be not like understanding. Like why don't people see that? Like I'm not like blink twice if you need help. You're not like I understand. It's just like really it's like I feel like they just overdo it. Like a lot of things they just do but this is just one thing they over because it hits home for you. It's the it's the father of your kid. It hits home for you. And I think anything do with time, right? Like if you if you believe in your relationship, I'm stand toes on it and keep it pushing because you're because no matter what nobody says, you're not even a reality TV show. Like I feel like if people could step and I'm more than happy to and I know he would too. Like if people would just take a look inside my life and see how we interact, see how we are with each other, the things we do for each other, the way we think of each other, like it would just make people understand like it would like it would make people understand like, okay, I see people, you know, people might hear things I did to him and question why he's with me. I think it's it goes both ways. It does. I've done, you know, things I've [ __ ] done to him. I've done a lot of [ __ ] up ass [ __ ] to him. Hurt people hurt people. You know what I mean? He did the exact same thing I did. He let me see the fire was hot. Realize the [ __ ] I was doing. Realize how the [ __ ] was. It's still [ __ ] I do. I don't Have you guys ever considered therapy? Like I know I'm not saying that's like an insult. We do. We've we've we've been seeing a therapist for probably like a couple months now, but not since we moved back to Florida. But I think we did numerous times. If you truly believe in it, I think that's important. I think it's important to get an outside perspective. And honestly, Danielle, stop looking at the comments. Sometimes it stops me from commenting back when I see like when I think about it like, you know, this person probably never had love. This person probably never experienced a relationship or have you ever read the book called It Ends With Us? It's a book by Colleen Hoover and it's it the book is written to where you learn to love an abusive relationship. Like the book is written to where it's a woman and a man who are together and she makes mistakes, he makes mistakes. She grew up watching her mom be abused and she couldn't believe she fell into the same pattern. And when she had a daughter, spoiler alert, she decided to end the cycle. That took years. Like it's not even about like ending it. It's like she in her mind she could have chosen to stuck it out with him because they were both hurt people. They were both very hurt people. And obviously like my point is from the in from the reader reading it, you learn the relationship and you love the man. You truly learn the ins and outs. I just thought of I went through so much [ __ ] with my mom. My mother has done unspeakable things to me. You know what people say even online? That's your mom. You got that's your mom. Why don't people say that's your man? So it's okay. Like, so because you're not blood, you you So because he's not your blood, you have to put up with it. Child, even tied with a child. I see what you're saying. You know what I'm saying? People like your mom could do unspeakable things and you have to tolerate it or forgive it or get over it because it's your mom. She should still respect her mother. She should still respect her. And people are going to say, ""Oh, because she gave birth to you."" No. Y'all say that about brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins. Y'all do that. Y'all say that when it's family. It's okay. It's not though. No, it's not. But I'm saying to them, when it's family, it's okay. You must even when it's down to Bro, I one of my closest friends father molested her sister and he still had custody of them and the court knew about it. That's disgusting. and they still would go to his house like and because it's family the why should they have to stay around him after what he's done but just cuz I had a black eye once and he cheated on me means I should leave him forever and break up a family. But that to me should have like I'm not like that's so sad to even hear though. Like regardless of how you guys treat each other, that should never be up for public discretion. Like if you're putting that out there, of course people are going to be like, ""Oh my god, Danielle is another thing. When when everything was going on, I had I already knew, and I'll explain this to you in a second, but I had already knew about him in Alabama. I had just learned how deep it was over the phone while I'm in Florida and he's in LA at her house in her bed. I'm finding out about this. He's not answering the phone. Finally, when we do talk, he's the type of person that just kind of like tries to get you when you get them. So, it's like he was trying to hurt me because I was like, ""Fuck you. I'm done with you. I'm never gonna speak to you again."" And he told me he was gonna take Callie and I was going through a drug problem at the time and I felt like he did have that over me and he could use that against me. So, I posted the video to put it out there that like, oh, maybe hopefully he can't take her with this being public. So it was an act of defense. My point My point was to even it out to keep my daughter, not to not for the world to attack. Yes, I knew the world attacking him came with it. Yes, I knew that. But that wasn't what it was for on my part. So when people tell me, ""Oh, well, you posted it and you"" It's like, you knew that was going to happen, though. I knew. Yes. Yes. But I But my intention I see what you're saying. You did it. There was It wasn't unwarranted like, ""Oh, look what Leavon did. It was I'm scared to lose my daughter."" Yes. Yes. And I And I said that. I said that. That was the next post. I know. But it it like it doesn't matter. Like it that situation was still really wrong. I now Now it's to the point where I don't even see let people see us argue over a peanut. Like I will literally I save that [ __ ] for when we get in the car. Internal. you're mad at him right now, you wait till you leave the door and you go argue about it. I'm not saying don't please don't put your hands on each other. Like like none of please like that. That's just I'm not condoning that. I'm not saying I condone that at all because I think I'm I'll be real. I still smack Leavon up sometimes because it but I don't hurt him. I don't hurt him. I just show him what I'm capable of. Do you do you feel his pain? Like what if you do? Um I have hurt him before and I did feel bad about it. Danielle, maybe therapy. Therapy. I'm praying for you guys. Therapy. Like I I want you. All I care about is for y'all to be happy. No, we're like way way way better. Like it's like not even especially now since we moved to Florida. Like we don't have no friends out here really. So like we just spend every day with each other. So we like spend every day with each other and we just like find random things to do. And like I'm having fun. I don't know how Pig's having fun, but I'm having fun. I that's that's such a touchy subject, but yet again, it's only one that you can it's it's for you. It's it's your story and however that story may may evolve or end for you. That's your story. Disclaimer, I promise you I don't have Stockholm syndrome. Like there's no active abuse going like for there to be Stockholm syndrome, there would have to be active abuse, you know, like and no one but but no one knows. You can't get Stockholm syndrome from somebody punching you one time or cheating on you one time. You can't. That's not how that works. Like, it has to be active. And I'm not There's no gun being held to my Do you like Do you know how many DMs I get a day from like all types of, you know, like I could literally And he could as well. He could be with any He's a very attractive man. He's very charming. His ways are just impeccable. Like, he could literally be with anybody he wants to be with. I could be with anybody I want to be with. and we choose each other. Yeah. Like that's just what it is. And I just can't like I literally just can't even touch on that subject cuz it's like it's not my relationship. I have no reason to speak on it and I don't think it's up for anyone else to talk about it either. But just know like from a woman perspective like like I that hits home for me and I just want you to be happy. Like that's that's truly it like that's literally it. I don't think you owe anybody an explanation. I've been in my fair share of [ __ ] I've done stupid [ __ ] when I was younger. Like I've said stupid [ __ ] So like I obviously know like what that means, but nobody can judge you or Leavonne unless they're in your house. And I don't, you know, like Callie seems well taken care of. She seems actually very spoiled and right the happiest kid in the world. And maybe that does come from like both of you guys being amazing parents. I'm not there to see it. And I don't want nobody to judge that situation because you're not in it. Obviously, you've shared things with the world that allow the judgment to to happen, but like me just being like a woman and someone that like I truly admire your work and how far you've come and the things that you've been able to get past. You do understand like a lot of people wouldn't have made it here. No, you have seriously surpassed a lot of odds that literally the cards were against you like from [ __ ] birth. That is one thing I try to tell people like I like I want to make this very very very clear. I have never gotten to the main things I wanted in life. I never got to pick for myself. Like I'm just I'd say like like I just think about you just being a girl. Like you were just a little girl. Like and that makes me like even emotional like you were just a kid. like 19 and up was probably when I started like getting a little bit more like freedom spiritual universe like from the universe wise like I always wanted to go to prom, never got to go to prom. I wanted to be a nurse. I wanted to be a pharmacist. I wanted to do all these things and unfortunately that wasn't what God had in planned for me. And I I didn't me and my mom did not sit there and figure out how we were going to get famous. My mom has something not all there with her. And she's been emailing Dr. Phil since I'm 2 years old. It It's not because she wanted to be famous or because she wanted money. My grandfather was a very wealthy man and took very well care of me and my mother. It wasn't that. It was that narcissists like a crowd. And if they can convince whoever's in front of them, no matter how big or small of a crowd, that this person is [ __ ] nuts and they're doing me so wrong and I'm so right and they're so crazy. Yeah, it's all about perception. That's all it was for my mother. It wasn't about money and it wasn't about fame. My mom probably never even thought of fame her whole entire existence and still does it now. It took some like it took my mom a really long time to even do a podcast. And you know, my mother told the lady, ""Don't ask me about stuff with my daughter. I'm not going to bash, no matter what my daughter might say about me, I'm not going to bash my daughter. You can ask me whatever you want, but just, you know, and it it's not about it's never been about fame, and it's never been about money. My mom always wanted a crowd. She'd do it to me at school. She'd do it to me afterare and programs, and she'd do it to me."" So that's what it was about. It was never about money or fame. I didn't know that. People think that we sat there and like conspiracized. I don't even know the word. 13. Yes. And how like I don't think you had the brain capacity to even be able to understand the capacity of what that even was. And like 13, you're supposed to be playing with damn Barbies, right? It wasn't it it literally like it wasn't. It's just so funny to me. I'll still go out with people about that [ __ ] too. But we went on the show. I was thinking that I was gonna go home the next day and go to school the next day. And I got sent to a program. That's a whole Yes. I from the Dr. Phil show. I was sent to a program where I was then abused, malnourished, and neglected for six months. What the [ __ ] I was supposed to come home for 100 day after 100 days. I was doing well in my program. Dr. Phil said, ""Keep her there for another 100 days till her fame dies down."" I had no reason to still be there. Um, yeah. And so I came home. I'm like, ""Mom, why?"" She So my mom, even though my mom was a [ __ ] she was still a good mom to a certain point, like, you know, so she she um she was like, ""You know what? I you're I guess when you come home from this program, you're not supposed to give your kids their phones right away."" She was thinking about it like, you know, I can't let her outside now. She doesn't even know what's going on. I'm going to just give her a phone. So she has something to do. Mhm. So what's the first thing I do? Facebook, Instagram. I'm like, 200 days? You had nothing for 200 days? No. Two? Yeah. Nothing. Six months. That's almost a Whoa. Six months. Six months. Nothing. Not even a phone call. And the letters, the letters you write out to your mom or your parents, they monitor them. So if you tell them like, ""Hey, I'm being sexually abused here."" They'll throw the letter out. I'm sick. I'm actually sick. We could get back into that though. But my point of that was Yeah. So my point of that was that was like, do you know how crazy that was to come home and you get on Facebook, Instagram, and it's a picture of you everywhere? And not only is there a picture of you everywhere, it wasn't because, oh, she's the next top model. She's so gorgeous. It was because you were this [ __ ] up kid with like they just they spun the narrative to make you look she's mean disrespectful to her mother for no reason and she steals cars and she People really don't understand. I would steal my mother I stole my mother's car one time. You know where my mother's car went? My friend's house. Thank you. I went to my [ __ ] friend's house. Yeah. I Yes. I stole my mother's cash and her credit cards. You know what I did? I bought Ubers to go to my friend's house. I feel like everyone's done that, though. I used to go and take 20 bucks from my mom's wallet and go to the food court at the mall. You have to understand there's there's nothing wrong when regular people do it. It's only when famous people do it. Then it's put on a pedestal and everyone's just going to die from this innocent situation that happened when you were five. That's what I'm saying. Like everything that happens with someone that's like has a little bit of clout or fame is just so emphasized when it's like so much worse [ __ ] is happening to the day-to-day kid to the day-to-day person that it's like but because it's not televised that's what I'm saying because it's not for public opinion no one says anything. You get what I'm saying? Like I do think what happened to you as a kid is it's kind of almost resurfacing now and and then everyone's like hold on Danielle became this woman and they're even almost saying like I'm surprised she got this far given the cards were literally all against you and it's like even then though like where was that energy when a child was being neglected a child was being the form of your face being posted everywhere and being like this [ __ ] up abused you know, you know, she abuses her mom and she treats her mom like [ __ ] That's a form of mental abuse. Yes. And this has been happening to me since I'm 13. Let alone the abuse I endured sexually. Let alone the abuse I endured emotionally, verbally, physically from my mother. Like, you know, I just never had a [ __ ] chance. Did you have friends? Yeah, I did. Like were that were like understanding the gravity of the situation? Like did you even understand? So, this is how it would go. This is how it would go. I would meet somebody and they'd want to come to my house and I'd be like, ""Can I go to ARS instead?"" And then they would be like, ""Oh, why?"" Like, and I'd just be like, ""All right."" I was And then I'd be like, ""You know, when we get there, she's going to play. She's going to pretend. She's going to put on a front. And then by the time you come here about three or four times, you'll see what I'm talking about."" And then after that play date, you're saying like your mom would get comfortable. Yeah. after that playd date or whatever, after that hangout, um they'd be like, ""Oh, she's sweet. She cooked for me. She's so nice."" And okay, all right. By that second, third time, soon as she gets comfortable, she going to show you her true colors. And every after that second, third time, everybody be like, ""Danielle, how do I get you out of here? What do I do? I need to save you. You can't live like this. This is this is unfathomable."" and they wonder why you like ended up being this like super defensive like it's part of your nature. That's what I was just telling El was literally just having a conversation with him about this and I just my new manager I was just talking to him about it too cuz it was like people never understood like I I know for a fact 100% I don't want to be black. I'm comfortable being a Italian Jewish white girl. That's what I am. I I never purposely put makeup on to be darker. I never told a makeup artist to do it. I never did anything to my body or anything to look like a race. I just I grew up around black people. So, yes, I might have an accent and I might gravitate towards certain things that black people do, but I never even from a young age I never looked at a black person and was like, I want to be you. Yeah. You know, like like literally I grew up there was literally Haitians on every corner of like I lived on a culde-sac and like every corner, not that circles have corners, but you know what I'm saying. Yeah. had a Haitian family and the all the little girls used to braid my hair and put beads and stuff. So braids to me, I grew up wearing that. I never knew that it was cultural appropriation. It if people even took the time of day to hear my story and realize I am probably one of the most cultural appreciative people there are. It's never So do you feel really misunderstood? Yes, 100%. Like that's why I want to do a documentary so bad because like I would watch it. It's not I like if you even knew for a second how I grew up and like okay for example me getting braids that's a part of my childhood. Like I'm about to get braids on Monday. Like I'm not going to stop because y'all don't understand. I know how I grew up. Like I have curly hair. Braids are good for curly hair. They make it grow. They protect. Like I That's another thing people don't understand. Like I literally I had Shirley Temple curls when I was a baby. Like or like probably like one to two. Like I've always had curly hair. I went through stages of having to wear it in a ponytail and straighten it every day and it got damaged. I had to perm the front of my hair because only the back would curl up. Like I've shown photos. Another thing of like my skin. I tan very easily. Like I was Italian at all. Um yeah. No Italian. I was just showing my my mother-in-law pictures of me when I was in Jamaica and she was like, ""Damn, [ __ ] you get dark."" Like all I have to do is sit in a sunbed two or three times or sit outside for a couple hours and my skin will get very dark. I tan I go I I go in the tanning bed or I sit I sit outside but I love I just started using the tanning bed and I love it so much more because I don't sweat my [ __ ] ass off for 5 hours. I know it's the tanning oil I use I use LVX and smooth faces. It is like it's not sticky. It I can go out and run my errands afterwards. I don't have to go home and I used to use carrot sun which is like the most stickiest Oh my god. Like I tan because it makes me look healthy. It contours my face, contours my body, it makes me look really, really good. It's not because I'm just infatuated with dark. It's No, it's not that. Like, you're doing things that make you feel beautiful. Yes. Like, I look way my makeup looks better. My It, you know, it clears my acne. Babe, I have I'm on Accutane. Like, I I Oh, you're a trooper cuz I wonder. Look, I'm out in the sun before like I started my acting journey and that's the only thing that would get my my I literally almost damn near you like [ __ ] burn it off. But speaking of that though, like how did you know you had a talent of like you because I'm assuming you write your own music and you like produce it and you do like the whole nine. Like how did you knew you like that's a talent that's a skill, right? Like a lot of I'm not saying a lot of people don't have it, but I'm saying like how did you find out and then transition into making music and and things like that? Also, shout out for putting me in your song. I loved it. It was a good little feature. So, basically, it was around the time of like Soundcloud music. Okay. And I was just watching all like I've always have loved music like love love music. Um, and I would like watch all these like talentless I'm not even gonna go all the way there, but making a living out of it. And I was just like, ""Oh, if they can do it, like I can do it. I can definitely do it."" Like I knew I had a voice. I used to sing all the time, rap all the time. I knew I had a voice. I knew I sound good. And I literally got a I got a label deal my second studio session. That's insane. So when did when did you like how did it blow up for you? Because I feel like the music industry is hard like it's hard to break into. Like it's hard if you don't have like the right team, the right people, or unless you just have like a [ __ ] hit and you can keep that momentum going because music is about momentum and consistency. So, it's like how did you like what was that first song that really like [ __ ] did it for you? Um, like for me personally or what blew up for you personally like that you were like this is what I want and then you created it and then after that it was like the internet just like loved it and then it became a career. Well, it kind of never went like that for me unfortunately. Really? No. So, I was signed to, like I said, my first my second studio session, I had a record deal. Like, I never got creative control. I It was never not I'm not saying the songs I have out aren't good, but they weren't how I would have portrayed myself musically. Really? Yeah. Like all those songs I said no to put out they were put out forcefully. So and you know people wonder why I was this like acting out crazy little girl. Like I was just forced to do so many like it was songs I loved so much. That's why like when you're asking me that I'm like she wouldn't even know them. There were songs I loved so much like music I wrote and like you know I would be denied because let me explain to you how a label works. They yes they make money if the artist writes it themselves but they make even more money if they have five of their writers from their label and five of their producers from their working because a writer gets paid off of the song that they write. Right. I'm assuming. And then they get a percentage of that and that and that and that and that. So how much is the artist taking home at the end of the day? It depends. Why are there so many splits? Only there's three writers. You have to split the money with three writers. Yeah. Where then you don't make money? Exactly. So when do you did you take over your own career and like did you leave the record? Yeah. I was I was able to leave Atlantic um when I was I think like 16 they let me leave and I don't know I I kind of it's not often that they do that but I feel like the case I would have had against them would have been so crazy that they let you leave. Huh. And is your music now is that more in your control? Especially with these diss tracks. I mean, obviously you had you had to write them yourself. I'm independent, so I get to do whatever I want to do. Like, I get to So, do you run everything yourself? It's me and LV. Really? Yeah. And then I just took on two I I literally cleaned house. I have a new Only Fans manager, [ __ ] um uh music managers, and I forgot what else I have that's new. I have one other thing I can't remember. Um, yeah. I just cleaned house and everything is like Are you Does that make you feel more creative? And I got rid of all the people who have known me since I was a kid and just little girl me that couldn't evolve with you. Yes. They just couldn't love those people. But I just Was that a hard decision to make? Because I feel like in this industry, like at least me specifically, like building a team, you always want your team to make it through to you to the end. But making it through to the end is not even like an end. It's like you want them to grow, evolve with you so that you can say like, ""Oh, I've had my day ones. Like this person's been with me since the beginning."" You know, it's so crazy for me. Like that's something that like, bro, even my assistants like firing an assistant for me. Like that hurts because I want you to see I just get so attached to the vision. I was just talking about that. Yes. That was my problem, bro. I lost so much money. I wasted so much time like just trying to hold on to these people and then you think because they've known you since you're so young and they've been there from the gym that they have your best and they really sometimes they do sometimes they don't like I really just had to clean house and I feel so much lighter. I feel so much more in control. Like I just feel like I'm about to be on like a whole new level. I'm excited for you. Do you have any beautiful like amazing things coming up? Yeah. Um I'm I'm working on like a bunch of different lines of stuff. Like I want to do hair care, makeup, skin care. Like your skin is flawless by the way. So I could take a couple really really long time to get here. And that's another reason I want to do it too is because I'm not just somebody who's trying to make money. I'm not like I You would rather fuel a passion than fuel your bank. Yes. Like I literally I literally What moves you isn't money, it's passion, it's drive. Like if you if you love the thing you're doing, you'll do it. But if you were making $30 million off of something, let's say hypothetically you hated to do this one thing and you were making $30 million a month off of it, you would lose you would rather lose that than and do something you love to do. It depends. It depends. If it was something if it was something like, oh, it takes 30 seconds and you it's kind of No, like it exhausts you. Oh, yeah. No, I'm not doing it really. Even if it was like a company if a company came to me and was like, ""We have this skincare product we want you to promote and I tried it and my face burned."" I wouldn't. No, I'm not doing it. I don't care if they're offering me five billion dollars to just hold it up like this one time. I'm not doing it. That's why for me skin care is like such a it's like like literally I am the person my friends LV everybody like if they have a skin problem or anything it's like they call me like what do I do for this hair skin anything nails they call me and they're like what do I do this just happened or what do I do this is happening like so I just feel like I'm already a beauty consultant girl don't tell me that cuz I'm about to call your ass and be like please tell me what literally like you'll call me and be Like, bro, this [ __ ] green bump just popped up. And I'll be like, like, yes. Did you just teach yourself? I taught myself and I asked questions every time I was getting facials, every time I was getting my nails done, every time I get my makeup done, every time I get my hair done, and then I did so much research. Does that go into cultivating your beauty team? Like, is that why you're like so picky with like who does your makeup, your hair, your nails? like it's because you know so much. So the first time I work with somebody, I watch them. I watch what they pick up. I watch what they do. I watch how they do it. I like to ask questions and see why they do certain things. And so interesting. They might pick up something green and it looks brown on you. Or they might pick up something pink and it turns red on you. Like you know what I'm saying? like the way they do it. It might it might not look like it's for that, you know? Yeah. But it's for that. And so I've literally I've I've used every beauty product from I mean every skincare product from Caravee to La Mer. Okay. And don't buy Laamir. Don't buy Sarah. Like this is both brands. Like I have figured out the best products that actually work. And I don't just know they work on me. I know they work on Elvie. I know they work on my friends. I know they like, you know what I'm saying? Like I know they work. What's one skincare tip you would give to everyone? Like the one thing you like can't like like the one thing you're like I would recommend this period. Like don't do this. Are you a sunscreen person? No. Me neither. But that's like the number one thing I need I need all the sun I could get. But it like makes you age. It does. But you're going to age anyways. I rather age with color than be pale. Me as [ __ ] Question. This is just my own curiosity. What's the first video online that you saw of me and you're like, I need to like reach out. I need to say something. Or like did you know we would get along? Babe, do you remember? Cuz didn't you show it to me? Didn't you show me the video of her talking about it? So, Leavonne was one behind it. He's always behind everything. Hey, look. Let me tell you. No. Didn't you didn't you show me the video of her and you were like hit her up like she's Yo, shout out Leavonne. He really put this together. He's the one that knew. So, he you would say, ""Leavon, are you like the the the marketing guy behind it?"" No. It's a no. He lets her do whatever the hell she wants. Well, look. Okay. Well, I'm He's like the little parrot in my ear like cuz you just flat out posted a story and tagged me like with the little thing and I was like, ""Oh my god."" I was like, ""So that was you?"" Leavonne just looks me and goes, ""That was me."" So what? So was it the video? Was it the first video I posted? Wow. Y'all do y'all want to know Do y'all want to know how Miss Whitman blew up? LV literally took every second out of his day on Tik Tok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, and he would repost every [ __ ] video he's seen. So, you weren't the one reposting my I reposted some of them, but Leavon No, the people I know, I'd probably repost them because they go to I'm talking about my requests. Okay. Oh, yeah. He went He dug deep. Yeah, my request. So, okay. Cuz I would I would have felt a little like in out of Yeah. No, if if I come closer. Oh, if I if I know you, it's coming to my primary and I'm probably doing it. Or if you're already in my primary, I'm probably doing it. But LV goes in the request. And I feel like these girls and these people were just like, ""Oh, if I post a video with it, like she'll repost it."" And that's literally what was happening. And like, who doesn't want to be posted on somebody famous page? What? So, who wrote the When did and what point in that writing session in the studio were you like yo we should say ask Camila she will tell you that this stupid [ __ ] is weird. I I said that you and that was just like off the dome. The end of the song just kind of came out. You didn't write it. You It just came out. It just kind of came out. I just like that really bonded us when I when I reacted to it for the f Did you watch that live or was it Leavonne watching the live cuz you popped in the you someone so one of y'all popped in the live and I was like yo she's watching he be on everybody's lives bro he was just doing that [ __ ] this morning and I want like you know when you wake up and you just want your phone like he grabbed my phone and I was like [ __ ] I just want to be on my phone and he was like commenting on everybody's [ __ ] sending roses and [ __ ] like I love that I do and like that was such like a surreal moment for me. Not only that, because I don't know if you saw I made it in Bama song, too. So, I really like guys like this was a lot for me. This was a big month for me. I was like, ""Holy shit."" Like, being in two songs, two like you don't understand. Like, this rap battle was huge. Obviously, you know, like, and for me to just have been like thrown in the mix, like I was like, ""Y'all, I got to start my own music career. I can't sing for shit."" For [ __ ] No, babe. No, babe. Like I cannot sing for [ __ ] Like I would have had to write something down like a million times, but like that really made me feel so special. And I know Bama said, ""Camila, [ __ ] shut the [ __ ] up."" But like, you get me? Like that was so like I was like, you know, when you're like in your brain like tittling your feet, like that was me. Like I felt like a little girl and I was like, ""Oh my god, this totally means Kim Kardashian knows who I am."" Like that's what it was for me. And like the cultural significance of like the Kardashians know my name. Like turn me up. Like that was so cool. Anyways, I'm really turned about that. I really am. And I really I appreciate it. Like that was girl. I hope you make another 50 million on Only Fans. I hope we together will make 60 million with our collab. But you know, anyways, I wanted to take time and and and just share my appreciation because it meant a lot. And to know that that came from the dome and you didn't even write that down or think about it makes even more makes it even more impressive. All right, let's see. Do you like being on social media? No. Like, do you like being a public figure? No. Really? I don't. I just it, like I said, I'm a very defensive person. It's just too much that comes with it. I literally I I rather my page be ran by somebody else. I don't want to have to deal with it. What about the music industry? Like, do you drop songs because you're passionate about the industry or do you drop it because it's that's what's fun for you? It's like a release for you. Yeah, it's like for me. Okay. So, it's not Is music something you want to take seriously? Yeah. So, are you pivoting from rap? Are you going to start doing more? Like, do you know that I've been rapping? Like, you didn't. I figured, but No. Okay. So, I've been This songs weren't my first song. No, I know. No, no, no, no. I know that much. I've been rapping since I'm like 14, 15. I had my my second session. Now, I'm embarrassed. My second session, I had a I had a record deal. Like, girl, I know Gucci flip-flops. Okay. Like that's like the OG. I was like 15. 15 years old. I was 15. Yeah, I've been doing this [ __ ] I've been doing this [ __ ] for I can barely remember a song. I can barely remember like lyrics. Wow. That I think that's just like a difference in like how your brain works. Like some people really I'm telling you like it's just something you're born with. You know what I mean? Let's see. Oh, this is something I want to know too because like I wouldn't consider myself f like famous. I think you are definitely like on a different tier specifically in like music industry like it's a whole different ballgame. Is there anyone from your childhood that like reached out after you like really made it? Like are there people in your life that you feel like have reached out specifically because you're famous to get something? I was always bullied in school and majority everyone everyone knew who I was but everybody didn't like me. I had like maybe like two or three friends and I went to numerous different schools. It was always the same thing. And I remember like the girls that would like go so hard and my mom always used to tell me like it's cuz your hair is long. It's cuz I let you get your nails in. It's cuz you're pretty. It's cuz this is cuz I was such a sweet person. And like I literally would start a school and like three days later, bro, when I went to [ __ ] Congress, I remember being in the bathroom and three other girls were in the other bathroom talking about how they were going to jump me because the main girl wasn't the prettiest girl in school no more. And my mom had been telling me this [ __ ] for years and I never believed her. I'm like, ""No one's going to be mean to someone cuz they're pretty."" Like, and that was literally like a shock factor for me. Like, and bro, her two friends were like, ""Bro, we're not going to beat the girl up because she's prettier than you."" Like, grow up. And these are like what, like 10 year olds talking. Yeah. Like, how do you think to jump someone at 10 years old? I don't know. Sixth grade. How old was I? Sixth grade. 10, 11. Yeah. Yeah. Sixth grade gave finally believed my mom after that. I couldn't believe it. Like you came home and you were like, ""Look, this the one time I'm g tell you I'm you're gonna take this [ __ ] I'mma tell you one time."" You were right. I do want to touch on the subject of like being a mom. I feel like you're a young mom. I'm going to say like you're a young mom. I I I'm older than you. You're Wait, did I answer the question though? Yeah. Okay. You're you're 22. I am 23. recently 23 and I'm like I feel like with my lifestyle it's so fast-paced like you I feel like you would understand like everything's fast-paced everything moves so fast and it's like raising a kid is probably it's I in my opinion I think being a mom is one of the hardest jobs in the world because there's no rule book there's no book to tell you how to be a mom there's no book to tell you how to raise a a woman to be a specific type of person like I have a lot of respect for like my mom and I I think moms deserve a lot of patience, you know, like I think the one I grew up u my parents are are immigrants. I'm like firstborn generation in in the United States and my parents didn't speak English and it caused a lot of, you know, trauma just from being an immigrant, right? Like they didn't when we would go out places like people would yell at my mom because they she couldn't speak the language and they'd get frustrated with her. and I'm like six years old trying to like teach my mom how to say specific things and you know I would order from my parents like being a mom like you need to have in my opinion like people need to have a lot more grace for and I want to touch on the subject of like what does how did that change the way you viewed life like is postpartum depression like is that truly real is it like and what does that mean because I feel like when you when when I hear postpartum I think of like oh you're just kind of like sad that you h your body just went through that like I don't know. No. So basically postpartum depression is your brain so chemically [ __ ] up because of the hormones that everything is just wrong. Like some people they could be unhappy with their body, they could be unhappy with their partner. They could be unhappy that they don't have a partner. They could have a hard baby. I had an easy baby. My baby was so easy. Oh my god. But they could have a hard baby that just won't shut up or just won't go to sleep or just collicky, gassy, anything like there. It could be so many things that go on plus this chemical imbalance in your brain. I had to get on anti-depressants. Really? Yes. And I had a partner. I had a nanny. My baby was easy. My Was it like a disassociation of like did you feel connected to Cali? Yes. 100%. like yes I literally since the second and it's so crazy because I I'm such a selfish person I did I'm a very nurturing person and a careful person but I'm a very selfish person too I don't know how that works but I am I have many different qualities from each side and when I literally looked at her I just like everything from that moment became about her and a lot of people even around me will tell me like you care about Leavonne more than you care about Cali. And it's like you couldn't even imagine. Like when people tell me that, I get mad. Yes. But I laugh almost because it's like like I would literally put Leavon in the trunk and put the car in the lake if it came to my baby. Like Yes. Like it's just because but like I'm like just as much as I'm like motherly and all this stuff. I'm the same way with him. So it's like people see that and they almost think like oh you must put him first but they don't see that it's like a whole like it's not like that at all. And would you say you're And would you say you're more selective with who you give your energy to? Like now that you're a mom, like the people you allow in your life, the people you speak to, the people you allow your daughter to hear on the phone, like is that did you truly change? Like did your life completely change? I'm already a really picky person with who I allow in my life and I've always been like that. I can be friendly and I can socialize and all that, but I like Elie tells me all the time like, ""Bitch, get friends. Like, what are you doing?"" And I'm just like, ""No, I want to be your friend."" I don't want to be nobody else's friend. Your man should be your best friend. Yeah. Like, I can hang out with you. Why do I have to hang out with them? Like, I think it's good to have like a common like medium, right? Like I think there's space where even like like my mom would tell me growing up like I need to have like my time with like our like you know there's like friends that you have that aren't couples, right? So it's like my parents will go out with their couple friends and my mom would sometimes go out with her girlfriends. Like I think it's a it's a good thing to have individuality because it allows you to feel like a woman. Yeah. But you get what I'm saying? For me it just it doesn't make or break me honestly. Like I can go weeks without having a girls night and I'm fine. Like I don't feel like a girl's night, but like what what about like just time to just literally be completely alone by yourself and do like whatever the [ __ ] you may want without having any inter uninterrupted time. You know what I mean? Like Yeah, I do. I do. I I spend time with myself a lot, but I don't know. I just I just honestly You have to understand look at the thing the things I have been through. Yeah. Especially friends wise like What's the craziest thing a friend has ever done? Okay, besides B. Besides that one, Jay said it's him. [Laughter] Okay. So, I I haven't fought since I'm like 13. And like like physical fight or like verbal fight? Like physical fight. Like I've slapped people. vibe, girl. That's the But I haven't like tussled like a throw down. Oh, okay. All right. My literally my best my bestest bestest bestest friend made a comment about Leavonne and I fought [Music] her. And why did you fight her? I was I had a kidney infection. This is the literally probably the night I talked to you. This happened when I was in LA. Yes. You beat your best friend up. Yes. I had a kidney infection. I had 102 fever. I was throwing up everything that I eat. I could barely walk down the stairs and I don't know. Something had happened. Something had happened and they ended up in the car together and he drove her back to my house. It was just already like you were already irritated. It was just already like why does this always happen? Like I get it. Y'all come back here. And it was just like I feel like she's on to something. I feel like LV don't even think she even think like that. But it was just odd to me. And maybe I'm maybe maybe I am just scared and I can't trust people after that and stuff like that. I don't know. But what what went through? You thought she was getting out, Leavonne? Yeah. And but she made a comment and then that's Okay. So her Uber is like 3 minutes away. I'm still outside trying to get him in the house and I'm just mad cuz everybody's drunk and I'm just sick. And I'm like, ""Bro, like I need you to leave so I can get him in the house and I can just go to sleep."" And she was just saying stuff like, ""Oh, I'm so I'm not your friend. I'm not your friend. And I'm like, ""No, [ __ ] You're not my friend."" Like, no. Like, and she looks at me and she goes, ""I'mma have your man take me [Music] home."" I'll show you the video. I literally just ran around the car like I didn't know I still had it in me. I ain't going to lie. I thought I was going to get my ass beat. I'm not going to lie. But I really held my own. And she's way bigger than me. I'm going to hold your hand when I say this. Why would she say that? But let her let her tell it. I've spoke to her after this. Let her tell it. Elvie offered to take me home. I don't care. Like I don't Okay, but I don't care. Elvie could barely even walk in the house. No, but I don't care. Like that part. What did the words I'mma let your man take me home would have fighting words, right? Fighting words. [ __ ] I'm Latina. I You know what? That was justified. Sorry, I'm gonna say it. That was justified. I would have done it. I would I I would Why would you say that? No, because that the reason for that being said was to piss you off. Correct. That was probably like one of the most craziest things that have ever h besides the bish that was probably No, no, but given the situation that happened with you experiencing people trying to get at your man, like why would you say that? Right. Have you made up? Mm- And I'm not. I don't care. I'm not. How long were you friends? Probably since I'm like 15, 16. Okay. That's sad, though. Maybe. Okay. But no, that's, you know, I sat there and did that, too. No, I I sat with myself. Let me tell you, I'm not saying like I sat with myself and I tried to figure out there could be another side of the story. She could she could have another perspective on it. but did the words your man is what I'm gonna have you when I show you the video because I have cameras and they pick up sound and everything. When I show you the video, you're gonna see her facial expressions. You're going to see everything she did when she said it. And then you're going to see her when I run around the car get into fight and stance like you knew what you said and you knew it was going to happen. Okay. I don't I don't condone violence. I don't condone violence. Maybe you should have just cut her off and never talked to her again. Like I Why would you say that? I don't know. Okay. Well, I'm sorry. And I I hope that if that friendship meant a lot to you, I hope that maybe you could figure it out. But wouldn't have to keep her on a leash around her. I don't I think she just said that to make you mad. I don't think she Maybe she wasn't trying to You made her upset, so she said, ""I'm going to make you upset."" Do you actually think she wants to get with your man? Yes. Okay, then. Maybe don't rekindle that. Never mind. Never mind. Maybe she just said that. Was she drunk? Yeah, a drunk mind. Sober thoughts. Come on now. Okay. What's the dumbest thing you've bought since making money? Like the thing that you went home and you're like, probably shouldn't have purchased that. Probably like some jewelry or something. Do you still have it? Probably not. What? The Durango. The Durango. I know. I love my car. How many cars do you have? The car I don't have yet. Which one? Five. Yeah, five. I want the long wheelbase Range Rover. Okay. I thought it was going to be like a Ferrari. You don't like sport cars? Sports cars? No, I do, but I need an everyday car. I need a mom car. A Cullinin. No. This doesn't go fast enough for me. It's a V12, babe. No. Come on, Jay. The cullinin. I've had I've had I've had cullinins before. I just don't I'm sorry. Yeah, I've had like three of them and they're not enough. Okay. Word word. What was a pivot point where you decided to talk about serious topics in your past online like abuse and mental health? Like when did you think like okay this is my moment like I want to speak about this? Uh just whenever I was comfortable. I was never like scared per se or like waiting for a perfect moment. I just feel like maybe something might have happened in that moment or something and I just wanted to talk about it. So it was just really when it comes up for you like when you feel it. I know for the turnabout situation the the program I had went to where they did all that stuff. It was another girl saying she had got molested there and that's when I spoke out about it because I just kind of kept it to myself cuz I I thought no one would believe me. I just you know that's a common thing that happens like women don't speak up because they're afraid no one's going to believe them and that's just going to be like a voice in the multitude of millions like Yeah. Like I just spoke out about on the Ari on Ari show I just spoke out about the Frank did you see it the Frank situation like your security guard that's disgusting. I did see that. Yeah. And that was from 13 to 16. Did he get any repercussions because of it? No. Ever? No. airplane mode on my phone because they're not going to stop calling. Thanks, Deon. Yeah, I do that, too. Have you ever like been on the phone and then you're like, ""Oh, the connections that you put on airplane."" I do that. Yeah. Sorry if you've ever got if I ever like I just exposed my [ __ ] self. Anyway, what keeps you grounded? Cuz for me, I haven't figured that out yet. Yeah, I don't I don't think I have either. It's just like certain things I do like I don't know my purposes be like for example I love getting ready in the morning really like showering and my skin routine everything like oh why I love doing that like I love getting dressed to just like stay at home or like do you do something okay both like to feel pretty I like that like my the things the things that make me happy are like being a mom. What's your favorite part of being a mom? Just like watching her do things. Really? Yeah. Like now like that's a little person doing something. She says hi. She says bye. She says awa. Awa. Yes. So my nanny is Colombian. Oh my god. She's going to know Spanish. Yeah. You need to get one that speaks like multiple languages like French. So she's just going to be speaking every language ever. Oh, literally. She like she just I just love watching her do things. Like she hands stuff to me and it's just like the little tiniest simple things are just like like that's a piece of you. Yeah. That's so interesting. And then like she has my attitude now. Isn't she one? Yes. Like sometimes she doesn't like me and I don't I don't judge her. She's like, ""Get the [ __ ] away from me."" No, sometimes she really does not like me. And I And when she does this, I sit there and I show her every single picture and video of her coming out of my vagina. Danielle, I sit her down and I'm like, ""Hey, I'm your mother."" I' I've had to do it like five times this week alone. Um, so she So this is what she does. Like, ""What's your favorite movie, Callie?"" She's like, ""But my mom has shown me my [ __ ] birth video 17,000 [ __ ] times since the age of one."" So that would be it. Like I plan on pulling those videos out forever. Like was that how explain that moment? Like give me Let me tell you what she does. Let me tell you what she does. I So my my mommy my nanny will be holding her and I'll walk up and I'll like So either she goes like this or she goes from you. Yes. And she'll fullblown start crying like And I'm just like, ""All right, you know what? Let me remind you who your mother is."" Wait, that would make me so sad as a mom. It makes me really sad. That would make me so And then she runs over to him to Leavon or to my mom. Maybe she needs a moment with her dad or her grandma. But like you listen, this is your selfish moment where you're like, ""No, when I want time with you, I I need you to want your time with me."" I get it. I see it. I see it now. Yeah. Like she really makes me so mad and I'm just like, you know what, little girl, she's one. She makes me mad. She's one. She makes me mad when she does that. I don't like when she does that. Gets mad at a one-year-old. I mean, I get it. I'd be upset. That's the one thing, too. Like, I've always wondered like, okay, if I have a kid, like, I'm going to have a nanny, right? Like, I would go into full-blown panic attacks if I thought that that baby thought that that was her mother. Like, is that never a fear? Yeah. Yeah. The nanny, I'm assuming, spends more time with Cali. Yeah. But because like she spends like nights with her and stuff and I will say that's like one thing I regret. Like I so I had Cali by myself fully for like the first two months like full 247. We had a nanny. We had a night nurse but that's a whole another story. And I just didn't trust it. That's what I'm saying. Like that's my biggest thing because of the things that I went through as a kid. Like I'm So my nanny is actually my housekeeper that had been doing my house for like years. Yeah, that's one thing that people don't talk about enough. I recently I don't even want to talk about this, but I recently just got robbed in New York by like a hotel and they like stole like my diamonds and stuff and over here thinking like I'm so blessed to trust my my maids and I and and I treat the people that work for me very well because I never want them to leave because people don't understand how hard it is to find people to [ __ ] trust 100%. So what happened was me and my friend were going to the mall and they were cleaning the house and we were packing the baby up and Fernando was like, ""Oh, you do you want me to?"" So it's a mom and a daughter. So she was like, ""Oh, do you want us to watch the baby while you're going?"" I'm like, ""Oh, sure."" And when we came back, Callie was like all nuzzled up. She had mits on. She had her little socks on. She was good. And I I told Levon about it, and he was like, ""Well, you know what you got to do?"" And we just made her the nanny. And have you ever you've never regretted it? And she's the best. Yo, shout out Danielle's nanny. Is her name Fernanda? Lloyd. Lida. Shout out Lida. It's hard to find good people, you know? It it really is. And I know I've seen on the internet that like you've talked about like getting robbed and like is it people from like the inside? Like has that I have no idea. Never been solved. But it's okay. Nothing with me has ever solved. No man who's molested me has ever went to jail. No woman that's done nothing to me has ever had consequences. No, like literally nothing. Like karma will get them. No, no child that bullied me in school ever got in trouble for it. But when I punched him in the face back, I got expelled or suspended. See, that would piss me. Like that's just annoying. Literally, when I was in school, a a girl walked up to me. I was walking I I it was at lunch. I was walking with my tray towards the table and I was actually like talking to one of my friends as I'm walking towards there and we were like laughing and whatever and the girl walked up, smacked the tray out of my hand and pushed me. So I rocked her [ __ ] world and I got in trouble. She didn't get in trouble at all. Well, cuz you even though she pushed me. Okay. Well, yeah, cuz usually the school system will will will defend the f or will penalize a person that threw the first punch. A little girl walked up to me and pulled my pants and underwear down in front of the whole class. And guess what they told my mom? Her parents are going through a divorce. Where the [ __ ] are these schools? Palm Beach County. Here in Florida? Yeah. Did you rock her [ __ ] I was too young. Well, [ __ ] that little girl. Wherever she's at today. Do you Do you ever keep Do you ever know where they're at? Oh, so that's what I was telling you. Like those are the ones that hit me up. What? Yes. What? Those are the ones that hit me up and it's like the weirdest thing ever. Pause. They bullied you. You specifically know who they are. Bro, one girl wanted to fight me because her boyfriend had a crush on me and I wasn't even aware. You're You do realize you're She does realize you're famous, right? Like you are bad. No, this was this was this was like in school. Oh, okay. I'm like like the whole school was following me while I was walking to class and I was so confused and her sister actually was the one that was like this I this is not about to happen. Like she was going to fight me and she hit you up. Yeah, she hit me up. What the [ __ ] did she say? I need to Hey, girl. Yeah, like [ __ ] like that. Yeah. Oh, do you remember me? Oh, [ __ ] I never forget. Shut the Wait, I would lowkey respond. Wait, no, don't don't respond. Don't. That's bad PR. There was this little girl. Her name was Kiana Kiki. Oh, wow. She invited me. Oh, if I ever see this little [ __ ] I don't care how long it's been. When did this happen? Her and her raggedy ass fat ass donkey looking mother. If I ever see these two people, I'm crying. So, this is the [ __ ] that like used to happen to me when I was a kid. And you wonder why I was the way I was. I get invited to her birthday party by her. It's at her pool. Her mom like everyone's chilling. Even my best was H I feel like Hannah was there. My best friend Hannah, who's still my best friend to this day, she was there. Like the little girl's mother comes to drop snacks off and she sees me. I don't even know this woman. Why would you know your friend's mom from school? Don't think I ever even met her before, even in passing at school or anything. She went crazy on me for being there and chased me. She literally chased me from the pool probably halfway around the neighborhood. This big silverback gorilla, 250 lb lady. Where was anyone else's mom? No, it was just the girls there. Like you got dropped off. Did you? My mom came. She called the police. My mom was not My mom wanted her [ __ ] head. Like, but my mom couldn't do nothing because the police were already there by the time the lady showed up. Yeah. And she hit you up on some, ""Hey girl, remember me?"" And so now, okay, the girl who was going to fight me about the boy, she was big. She was tall. Yeah, she was fit, but she was big. Big bone thick. So, she was friends with the girl Kiana. And whose mom chased you? Yes. And we were at Atlantic. Atlantis. Atlantic. I forgot what it's called. I think it's Atlantic. Something after the pool chasing. Yeah. Like a couple months later, one night. And I was going to fight her in the bathroom. And the big [ __ ] came in and wouldn't let me fight her. She wasn't trying to fight me either, but she was just like trying to like stop me. She was trying to reason with me. Then what happened? I just couldn't do nothing cuz it was like three of them plus the big [ __ ] [Music] Yo. So, is there a world where you would ever even see them in passing? Like, could they ever even be around you? Now that I'm back in Florida. Yeah. And I It's a lot of these little [ __ ] I hope to see because it's not worth it. They had they had gradu a graduation party and passed the invitations out to everyone but me and said, ""Make sure Danielle doesn't see this."" And even the teachers knew about it. You don't forget about anything. No. Well, they're not worth it. You're a bad baby. Like, I got in trouble one time for I I always I always had big boobs. Like, my boobs were always big. Like, a lot of people fail to realize I did just get my boobs done, but I got them. I The pictures I showed my doctor weren't of another girl. They were of me before having Cali, before breastfeeding. So, I actually went smaller than I used to be a triple D. I'm like a Double D. I can fit a D. Like, I think right now I have a D on, but I can fit a double D, too. So, I always had big boobs. Oh, she she's got tissue in her bra, like at lunch, like just for no reason. Girls are so mean. Like, genuinely, of course, all of them were flatter than a washboard. So, that's how it usually goes, right? Like you want something that someone else has and like it'll never be. That's how like like kids are just pull my [ __ ] out. You did what? I pulled my [ __ ] out in the bathroom. Yep. I said, ""Gather around."" And of course, one of them went and snitched. I said, ""Tiss. It's tissue, right? It's socks. It's tissue. Oh, yeah. Okay. Now what?"" And guess what? After that, after that, everyone talked about how huge Danielle's boobs were, and I was the talk of the [ __ ] school. And I bet they [ __ ] hated it. It's not worth it. Don't trip over their No. Who are they? Where are they today? Where are they? What are they doing? Where's the Where's the 250 pound girl? Where Where's she at? What is she doing? Like, Danielle, it is not worth it. Let it go, bro. But when I was at Congress Middle School, my mom was a stripper because she drived a Challenger and had a fat ass. I used to get bullied cuz they thought my mom was a stripper. They were pulling anything out to just [ __ ] with you. Like, bro, it was the And this had been going on since preschool, bro. I think that's why you're very defensive. Like, yes. Like, it's always something like I'm sorry that your mother sends you to school looking like who did it and why. My mother would My mother would get my nails done, get my eyebrows done. She taught me how to shave when I was like nine or 10. Like my mom was very big on hygiene. Like, and it wasn't about, oh, you have to look sexy or you have to please men. It was just about keeping yourself together. Yeah. I mean, nine or 10 is kind of young for that, though. Shaving. Yeah. I was a hairy [ __ ] and and she couldn't risk she couldn't risk what they would do to me. She couldn't risk it. What? The things they would say. Yeah, she couldn't risk. Would you come home and tell her? Yes. I was Yeah, I I got made fun of. I went to a um Fun fact, I went to a Well, you know how many times my mom drove back around and went back into the school. Like, that's so sad. And they would never do nothing about it ever. Anything. Nothing. Yeah. And then they wonder why people fight. I remember like middle school just being like just a [ __ ] [ __ ] show. Also, high school, like I was never I went to high school. I was never liked. High school's brutal. High school's like [ __ ] Like, but I've I'm going be honest with you, like I'm I'm a nice person, but it doesn't mean I'm a kind person all the time. Like, I'm nice and I'm a very very loyal person. Like, me and my best friend Julie have been friends for like 10 years. Like, I'm extremely loyal. Like, see, and that would be a very loyal person. That would be me. I do have friends that I've been like me and Hannah, we've been friends since fourth grade. Like I do have people like that, but it's just I it it be them. Like you have the wrong people in your life. You would still be here right now. And that's why I'm just so selective with who I let around me, who I let around him, who I let around my daughter. And you should be. It's protect your energy. You know what I mean? But I'm telling you, like I I'm I'm such I'm I'm very defensive. Like I'm I'm I'm a [ __ ] when it comes down to the people that I love. Like I'm very That's the whole reason this thing even popped off. Like oh, Camila's clocking tea. Like I'm not clocking tea. I'm standing up for what's right. I'm not I don't want to sit here and come on and act like I'm a I'm not a problematic person. And I'll tell you right now, like I could have a deal with Prada for $50 million if something's going on behind the scenes that's [ __ ] up wrong and just outright maybe just illegal. I will never put money before what like the right thing is. And I've always been like that. And like in my opinion, some girls will literally just like to be the popular person or to be like like I was always just the one that never took [ __ ] Like I just didn't like that. I have a I have a I'm witty. I'm quick with it. I have a smartass mouth. I'm sarcastic. And some people don't like it. You're the type of person you walk in a room, people want to talk to you because I'm telling you, you defeated odds and they want to know why and why they couldn't. You walk in a room, you're a light, Danielle. Like you have such a good a lot of people don't understand about me is to be honest like Danielle she walks in the room and it like radiates like people people really don't and that's like people get very jealous and envious of that people that is not something you can buy that is not something you can go to a doctor and get like the the way I am like you like like how you said quick what like you're very personable like the way I am it's just not for sale. And that really that really hurts some people. Me and Julia specifically, like there's just anybody in my opinion, there's just an unspoken rule. If you've ever said you think he was cute, if you've ever even looked at him and bat an eye, if he is with someone that you've ever been with, like if someone if if Julia was with a man, even if it was a one night stand, they were [ __ ] up, you don't touch that man. You know what's crazy? You don't touch the man. You don't look at him. You don't text him. You don't talk to him. Elie wasn't the only one. Hm. Elby wasn't the only one that you'd been with that she'd been with. That's not right though. Like you set up SSA. She was [ __ ] got it. I think she still [ __ ] got it. And my friend Autumn who I was seeing. It's just a rule. It It truly is. Like it if if she I mean she had been around me and got it a lot around like in the same setting. She was even around LV in the same setting. It's an unspoken rule. Truly like it. If Julia's ever even in a conversation, we went out to a party. If you see her in his likes on you don't like the picture. You don't do it. You simply don't do it. It's because why would I want to instill doubt in you? It's one thing to be like, ""Oh, I seen you in Joshua's likes. He cute, ain't he?"" Like, that's one thing. Yeah. Okay. You can gas up your friend if they're not in love with the person. Yeah. Exactly. Like if you're in love with someone and you're like I this is just me. If I'm in love with I'm in love with my partner and you came to me you're like oh like he he seemed like like you make a comment that isn't okay like like for example if you're in love with someone you don't ask oh is like how's the dick? Like that I think that's inappropriate. I think that's inappropriate because if you don't like someone and you hooked up with somebody and I was like that's inappropriate. Yo, how was the sex? Cuz you don't give a [ __ ] about him. Yeah, it was a one night thing. But for someone to come in and be like, ""Yo, how's Leavon's?"" Like, ""What what what what the [ __ ] do you want to know that for?"" Like, that's me. Like, that's how I would ra. That's just principle to me. I do I get a lot of questions like that and then people try to play it off like, ""Oh, well, I'm just trying to see why you stay."" Like, and I promise you, like, yes, his dick may be one of them, but it's on the bottom of the [ __ ] list. Like, that [ __ ] is literally so crazy to me. Like, people really try to play it off with that. He's right there. No. Like, yes, his dick is definitely one reason I say, but it's like there's he does a lot way he does a lot way more greater things than just sex. Like I I would never like that's just not me. You know what I'm saying? Like I don't know. And I think that's honestly I'm going to be honest with you. Like I I have very few friends. I have Julie. I have the Bob House girls. Like if they're upstairs right now, but like you would truly love them. like they're very sweet, kind people, but there is an unspoken rule. You you just don't do it. If I see Julia in somebody's likes, you avoid it. You avoid it. You just don't do it. It's just like it's awkward. It's an awkward situation to be in. I when you are trying to build something with someone and when a friendship is something that's friendship takes work, it takes time and it takes trust. Well, let me tell you how I am. there. When I was single, there was this guy that used to hit me up all the time, like super famous, super rich, super known, like not necessarily my type, but my best friend used to say like all the time, like he's a rapper. My best friend used to say like all the time like, ""Oh, he's so fine. He's so fine. Like, he's my favorite."" And I always avoided him. And this man probably would have had me doing anything I wanted to do with I'd be pocketing my money while he paid my bills. He wanted me so bad. And I just couldn't fathom the fact that she always used to say how it First of all, it'd be odd. Like it'd be weird. Yeah. Like I couldn't respectfully I could not suck your dick knowing my friend was in my ear saying that she wanted to [ __ ] you. Yeah. And like I just how like how would I know that she still doesn't want to do that? And like you know Yeah. I feel you. I feel you. I think we hit all the points. I'm excited. I'm I'm happy you came. Are you comfortable? Do you want to say anything else? Do you have anything else you want to talk about? Any last words? I think that's it. But if you have like this is the last time I'm gonna say it, so if you have any more questions about that situation, get them out now. I literally don't you know it to conclude the Bama situation. Bama, look, I don't hate you. She might hate you. And like I understand that I chose to be with him and like I'm the one that's going to have to like yeah it would have been way easier to forget about it leaving him and just leaving it in the past. But you know I choose to be with him and I have to fight through it. And so y'all got to understand y'all saying these things about me, comparing me, it's not helping my healing process. It's already hard enough for me as it is. and seeing somebody say something that's not true or have the story wrong, like it just takes the life out of me not to correct it. So, like, if you're if you're really my true fan and you care about me, just stop. Like if you're really my true fan and you care about me and you want to see me heal through this and get through this and you want to see my relationship thrive and me thrive as a mother and a person cuz [ __ ] like this will affect every side of you, you know, like leave this [ __ ] alone. Y'all don't have to even comment, oh, you're prettier than Bama or I don't even want to see her name. Like just let this [ __ ] be. Everything doesn't have to be. And I'm going to continue to wear blonde hair. I'm gonna continue to do me like continue to to continue to fight for your happiness. I will. And I truly admire you. Love you. I I I love your work. Thank you for the feature in the song. Can I have a hug? I just feel like I want to hug you. Thank you for coming. I This couldn't have gone better. I want you guys to know that not everything is how it seems online. You know, cut people some slack. I love you guys. We love you guys. And uh stay tuned.",0.067,0.699,0.234,1.0

the holiday on Monday are weather team tracking it all. Also, tonight, President

Headquarters in New York, this is World News Tonight. Good evening, thanks
for joining us on this Saturday. I'm Wade Johnson. Breaking news as we come on
tonight, an emergency landing after a bird strike at Boston's
Logan International Airport. The plane landed safely
and passengers eventually moving on to another plane,
But it comes during a record-breaking holiday
travel weekend, more than 45 million
Americans on the move. TSA screening more than 3
million on Friday alone. That's one of the
busiest days ever. Newark Airport still struggling
with flight delays due to an ongoing shortage of air
traffic controllers. The Lays now averaging
more than two hours. Despite the FAA, cutting
the number of flights after weeks of disruptions. more than 39 million Americans
are driving to their holiday destinations, but severe weather
could disrupt some of those travel plans, especially
in parts of the South. ABC's Morgan Norwood leads
us off from New York. Tonight, Americans on the move,
more than 45 million, making the mad dash to their memorial
day destinations, according to AAA projections. The travel crush testing the
limits of the nation's already strained aviation industry. In the Northeast, Newark Liberty
Airport, one of the country's biggest hubs, still
feeling the crunch. Flight delays through Newark
this weekend on the rise, now averaging over two and a half
hours, blamed on an ongoing staffing shortage of air traffic
controllers, even after the FAA slashed the number
of flights, following weeks of disruptions. in Boston, a United plane
returning to Logan Airport, the pilot reporting
a birth strike. Nature of the mercy was a
birth strike left and wing. Nationwide, the TSA screening
more than 3 million people on Friday alone, marking
the busiest travel day of the year so far. The line was really,
really long today. The roads also jammed packed,
triple-lay protecting more than 39 million driving
to their destinations for Memorial Day. On the west coast, a
major holiday artery reopening just in time. The Pacific Coast
highway shut down for months after the
devastating palisades fire in January. Now back open. Very happy I've been
driving this every day. And with millions hitting
the roads this weekend, many headed straight
for the beach. Officials urging caution
after early shark sightings along the east coast. And tonight, thunderstorms
temporarily stopping flights at Orlando International Airport. and the weather is still in little bit more of
a new two hours. And what tonight the
South racing once again for another
round of severe weather threatening
to disrupt not only holiday plans, but
travel for the millions heading home next week. What?
Morgan. Thank you, and
that severe weather threat
throwing a wrench in a holiday travel
plans from Texas to Alabama. Strong wind gusts,
slamming parts of eastern Oklahoma as
severe thunderstorms move through. Let's get right to
meteorologist Leslie Lopez from our Los Angeles station
KBC in New York tonight. And Leslie, where's the
greatest threat right now? Hey, WED. It's going to be here with you. And we're talking about the
greatest threat level right now right through that
Oklahoma City area. So as we're looking out
towards this large area, it's not just Oklahoma
City, but that is the place they can see the
greatest tornado threat. Anyway, from Lubbock
all the way out towards Tuscaloosa,
damaging wind, large hail, isolated
thunderstorms, all a possibility. That's tonight. And then we head into tomorrow. And now that area grows in size. From Lubbock all the way
out towards Huntsville, we could even see
some flash flooding. So that'll be a big concern
over the next 24 hours. We move you off into
Monday, which is the Memorial Day holiday. And you'll notice at the
center of the country still dealing with that
severe weather threat. However, each coast,
now clearing out really nicely, look in New York
75 degrees and beautiful for Memorial Day Los Angeles,
sitting about 78 degrees also really nice forecasts
for the Southwest. What? Something
to look forward to, Leslie, thank you. It's great to have you. Turning now to President
Trump today, delivering the commencement
address at West Point. The President praising the
cadets, calling them, quote, ""graduates of the
golden age of America."" His speech coming as he demands
changes from West Point to the Pentagon over DEI
policies and escalates his showdown with Harvard. Here's ABC Senior White House
correspondent, Selena Wey. Today President Trump addressing
West Point's graduating cadets. You are winners every
single one of you. While taking credit for
restoring America's military might. You will become officers in the
greatest and most powerful army. The world has ever known. And I know because I
rebuilt that army. Trump touting his America
first agenda, slamming his predecessors for
launching nation-building crusades. ""We're
getting rid of the distractions and we're
focusing our military on its core mission. crushing America's
adversaries, killing America's enemies and defending
our great American flag like it has never
been defended before. And highlighting the purge of
diversity, equity and inclusion across the armed forces. We've liberated our troops
from divisive and demeaning political trainings. One long time West Point
professor resigning in protest. these orders are to
indoctr not educate. But West Point is just
what have many schools facing pressure from the
Trump administration. Harvard is locked in a
heated battle with the president that
conflict escalating dramatically this week. The administration banning
international students from enrolling at Harvard at the
Department of Homeland Security ordering that existing foreign
students must transfer or lose their legal status. Harvard sued the
administration calling the ban unlawful. A federal judge
temporarily blocked the move on Friday. It's relief, at
least for now, for Harvard's nearly 7,000
international students about a quarter of its
student body. ""And with the president is
also shaking up his national security council sources,
tell that more than half of its officials were
put on administratively yesterday afternoon. This dramatically shrinks
the size of the president's key advisory group when
it comes to foreign policy and national
security decisions. Whit. So, lead
a weighing at the White House. Thank you. News on the economy tonight and
growing pressure on retailers. President Trump's trade war
taking yet another turn as he threatens to impose new tariffs
on tech giant Apple and the European Union. Some retailers
like Walmart and Nike are already
planning to raise prices. Here's ABC's Alex Persia. As millions of Americans
are shopping for Memorial Day savings, there's
new fallout tonight as President Trump
reignites his trade war with Europe threatening
to send prices higher. The EU's Trade Commissioner
urging that trade with the U.S. must be guided by
mutual respect, not threats and that it stands
ready to defend its interest. President Trump announcing a
50% tariff on European Union products starting June 1st after
he said talks between the U.S. and the EU are going nowhere. ""It's time that we play
the game the way I know how to play the game."" The president also for
the first time targeting an American company. Tech giant Apple could face
a 25% tariff by the end of June if it doesn't move all of
its iPhone production to the US. Tariffs on other tech
companies like Samsung could soon follow. The president has
downplayed fears that American companies
will shoulder the burden of these tariffs. - They're not hurting,
they're helping because they're creating
jobs in America and we're creating
tremendous amounts of jobs in America like
you've never seen. - But Commerce Secretary Howard
Luddick admitted this week that terrorists would
be felt here at home once they hit 15%. - The world has a
10% tariff now. At 10 percent, you're
not going to see it. Above 15 percent, I agree
you're going to see it. The mixed messaging sent
market sliding Friday. As three of the country's
biggest retailers say they're bracing for tough times. Earlier this month, retail
giant Walmart announced it will raise prices due to higher
cost from Trump's tariffs. The company also preparing
to lay off 1,500 employees. Target's hoping it won't have to
raise prices, but has already slashed its annual outlook
due to the unexpected impact of tariffs and
heightened uncertainty. And Nike is planning on raising
prices for a number of its products starting next week. It is not blamed tariffs,
however the majority of its footwear is sourced
in China and Vietnam. And Home Depot says it plans
to keep most prices stable in spite of the tariffs, but
on the holiday week and historically marked
by great sales. New data is showing that the
tariffs are driving up furniture costs, rising 7 times faster
than overall prices last month. Wait. Alex Brasheye,
thank you. Now to the frightening scene
at a college graduation, 12 people were injured after a tree
fell during the commencement ceremony in Northern California. At least two people were
rushed to the hospital. here's ABC's Melissa Adon. Tonight, authorities say 12
people are injured and at least two hospitalized after a tree
fell onto onlookers during a community college commencement
in Northern California. There's a tree obstructing
the path to the left here. Please clear the way for
an emergency response. The incident disrupting
the end of Diablo Valley College's ceremony for
nearly 2500 graduates. We're doing several
calls about it. I think it just fell on. the police. I believe they were on
a walkway adjacent to the football field. The college saying in
a statement police and EMT were on site. Additional emergency
responders arriving within minutes to treat the
injured and that they were able to complete commencement
and remove the tree. With the college is
also looking into how that tree was maintained
and what caused it to topple over onto the crowd. Whit? - Melissa
Don, thank you. Next tonight, new details
in that brazen jail break in New Orleans. A new report alleging the
inmates use hair clippers with multiple blades to
cut through cell walls. And the latest on the
hunt for the five, still on the run. Here's ABC's Philip Off. - Tonight, we are learning how
authorities think 10 inmates in a New Orleans jail,
several of whom were facing second-degree murder
charges, were able to escape and remain undetected for hours. Surveillance video showing
the men shoving a door and running off in
the dead of night. And authorities now
say they had help. - At 1 a.m., they were
observed on camera, exiting our facility using an
adjacent loading dock door. - In addition to the six
people who have been arrested for allegedly helping
the prisoners to escape and evade capture, authorities
accuse another inmate, the trail on Williams of
providing shirts and towels to the escapees to help them get
through the jails razor wire and authorities say they use
hair clippers with multiple blades to cut through a
cell wall according to CNN. Problems at the jail date back
decades, the Justice Department warning in 2012, conditions
at the Orleans Parish Prison have been dangerous and
unacceptable for far too long. the Orlean sheriff who
initially deflected blame for the escape now
says she takes full responsibility,
but says she needs millions to fix outdated
surveillance, aging infrastructure, blind
spots and supervision and critical staffing
shortages. Authorities
say they are confident the remaining five
escapees will be caught all of whom by the way. Our charge
was second degree murder. Whit. All
right, Phil. Thank you. Now to the
tragedy on the Hudson River in New York
City, the FDNY saying a sewage transport boat
explosion left one worker dead and
two others hurt. Officials say the blast took
place in one of the ship's holes. The cause of
the explosion still under investigation. Overseas now and aid is
slowly trickling into Gaza. This as Israel
continues with strikes in a ground offensive in the
region, dozens of people have been killed over the past 48
hours and tragedy for one Gaza doctor, nine of
her 10 children killed. Israel facing a
growing chorus of international criticism. Here's ABC's Marcus Moore. More death and destruction
in Gaza tonight as Israel escalates its assault on
alleged Hamas targets. Here a desperate
and dusty race to pull survivors from the
rubble of collapsed buildings. The Hamas Run Gaza Health
Ministry says dozens have been killed today alone. And yet more heartache
South of Con Yunus, where three airstrikes
killed a pediatrician's nine children at their home
as she cared for patients at a nearby hospital. The children ranging in
ages from just seven months to 12 years old. Dr. Al-Najar's second child and
husband also a doctor survived, but suffered critical injuries. Tonight, the IDF says claims
a civilian deaths in that striker quote ""under review""
and they claim before beginning operations
there, the IDF evacuated civilians from the area
for their own safety. While the humanitarian
situation remains dire, after international
condemnation and calls Israel to drop its blockade
on humanitarian aid going into the enclave. The United Nations Secretary
General says some critical supplies and food have passed
through, but only some. All the aid authorized until
now amounts to a teaspoon of aid when a flood of
assistance is required. With a senior doctor at National
Medical Complex in Conjunis, told ABC News, they have
not received any aid despite the urgent need. the situation in Gaza
remains desperate with no immediate end inside. With Marcus Moore
for us tonight. Thank you. Now to France and the
massive power outage there, temporarily
disrupting the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. ABC's and Ezda Lecatero joins
us now from Paris and as Arson is now suspected
in the blackout. Wait, French officials
are investigating whether Arson could be to blame
here after a massive power outage hit southeastern
Fran earlier this morning. The exact
cause of the outage remains unknown,
but it came just hours after a fire at an electrical
substation near Kent overnight. A police spokesperson
saying they're looking into the likelihood of a
fire being started deliberately. Tens of thousands
of people across the region were
left without power, traffic lights,
ATNs, train travel, we're all disrupted. Even the Kent Film
Festival was affected. Power has since been
restored and so far no rest have been made,
but officials say that all resources have been mobilized
to try to identify and track down the perpetrators. Whit? And as thank
you, there's still much more ahead on World
News tonight this Saturday. McDonald's announcing a
big change in closing some specialized locations. A crypto trader accused of
kidnapping and torture heads to court in New York City. and how this boat ended
up out of the water nearly striking a home. [music] Next tonight, a New York City
kidnapping case that sounds like a horror movie script. The suspect John Walts today
ordered held without bail, the crypto trader accused of
abducting an Italian tourist. Prosecutors say he tortured the
man in a Manhattan apartment for more than two weeks
allegedly to try to get the man's Bitcoin password. Waltz did not enter a plea. Prosecutors say he had
an accomplice who is still on the loose. When we come back, McDonald's
announces a corporate cutback. To the index now, new details
on the cargo ship that ran aground in a back yard. the 11,000 ton vessel
stopping just yards from a house in Norway Thursday. The ship's second in command
now charged with negligence. Authorities say he admitted to
dozing off while alone on watch. No one on the ground
or the boat was hurt. McDonald's is dropping its
drink-focused spin-off. Cosmix is closing. The stores with drinks like a
matcha ice latte hope to compete with Starbucks and others. However the company says sales
were lower than expected. All five pilot locations
will close next month, though some menu items
will land on McDonald's menus. When we
come back, a teenage athlete surviving
a life-changing health scare now working
to help others. Finally tonight, America's
strong, the high school athlete and his new passion
to save others. 17 year old Spencer Davis loves
sports, especially baseball. But it was on the football field
at Holiday's Berg High School in Pennsylvania, where he came
dangerously close to losing his life, collapsing after a hit to
the chest during a routine play, going into sudden
cardiac arrest. He was lucky because
his coaches were trained in CPR and they
had an AED near the field. For 13 minutes, those four
quick thinking coaches use an automated external
defibrillator and CPR restoring Spencer's heartbeat. His rare condition from
blunt force impact, the same suffered by DeMar
Hamlin of the Buffalo Bills. Breathe in down. But just weeks later, Spencer
began rehab, returning to school in time for winter basketball,
and then baseball by spring. Smashing a three-run homer for
the Tigers on his 17th birthday. Spencer's comeback
didn't stop there. Motivated to pay it forward,
Hiennys family founded the Spencer Davis Foundation. My new purpose is to just make
sure everybody's trained. Our goal is to spread awareness,
get 80s and just training for CPR for schools
that don't have it. Tonight's Spencer sharing
this message on life. Tomorrow's not guaranteed. Doing the things you love
with the ones you love most. Great advice. Thanks for watching tonight. Have a great night.",0.136,0.762,0.102,-0.9991
N-HJ0OFlx6U,112377,3310,711,Is a tweet is more DANGEROUS than a young man walking around with a machete or knife?,20250524,"But I think is a tweet Let me just come back to this. Is a tweet more dangerous than a young man walking around London with a machete or a knife? Absolutely not. Well, it depends, doesn't it, Lee? If a tweet No, it doesn't. Let me explain to you. Let me explain to you why. Okay, because you've got to be crystal clear. Two things can be true at once. People who walk around the streets of London, where I have a young family, with knives, should get very heavily punished in my view. M should people who encourage the burning down of asylum hotels with human beings in it, who are just as valuable human beings as you, me, Chloe, and everyone watching, should they be held to account for incitement to murder? of course state.",0.113,0.778,0.109,-0.3991

6U_oOYdQnEE,489636,9938,2200,"""This is not us!"" - Jurgen Klopp disappointed by Liverpool fans booing Trent Alexander-Arnold",20250524,"But we start with Jurgen Klopp who delivered a passionate defense of Trent Alexander Arnold describing his disappointment at the booze directed at the defender by Liverpool fans. The former manager Klopp said he had to turn off the TV during Arsenal's two or draw with Liverpool after Alexander Arnold was brought on as a substitute. It was the defender's first appearance since announcing he would be leaving his boyhood club this summer, but Klopp has pleaded with fans to show him some respect ahead of his final game for Liverpool tomorrow. Klopp was speaking at a Liverpool foundation gala ball last night where he was auctioning off an Alexander Arnold shirt signed by both the player and Klopp. I don't want to say tell you what you have to think, but I can tell you what you think is wrong. So that's what I can because I'm an old man and I don't waste time with hiding my opinion. So this boy with 18 years old, he scored a free kick in Hoffenheim when if he doesn't score that we don't qualify for the Champions League in the game against Barcelona. He did the most cheeky thing in the world and set up a goal for 4-0 which result in a game which will never happen again. I don't tell you you should not be disappointed. You should not be angry. I want you to I tell you, don't forget. Don't forget. This club doesn't forget. We are famous for not forgetting. We don't forget anything. We don't forget the good thing and we don't forget the bad thing, but we ignore the bad things and we remember the good things and improve as a group with that. And I tell you what, and that's now my thing. And I watched a lot of games. And I watched the game when he came on and I heard I heard the booing and I I I was said I'm old so it might be my hearing and I thought I made I switched on the volume. That's booing. I needed another 10 seconds to realize I switched the telly off because I I I I honestly I couldn't have been more disappointed in this moment. This is not us. 100% not be angry. Don't understand it. Whatever this boy, this boy gave and I was there. I was there every day. If he wouldn't have given everything, I would tell you now. But every day he gave absolutely everything for this batch. And now he decided after 20 years in his club that he wants to go somewhere else. If somebody should be angry about that, it's the owners. But they are not. But they are not. So we should why he didn't sign a new contract. I hear this from fans this this money discussion. He goes without the transfer fee. They have to be angry. Not not not us. It's not about that. He gave absolutely everything. He wears the Liverpool batch in the skin. But now he plays from next year on for another club. So we decide how we deal with that. I thought I go to last game and wear a trench shirt. But at the last game we we now we become champions. I don't want to be in the middle of any kind of the cameras will be there anyway. I don't want to deserve anything of that. You all deserve to celebrate with all you have with all you have. But tonight, two days before a game to tell you not what you I don't cannot tell you what you think, but I can tell you you are at least not right in this specific case. You were right so many times. You fought so hard for where this club is now. You you went through 30 years without a title and you did that in an exceptional way. And this boy, please please try it. You don't have to be happy that he's going, but don't forget what he did for this club because I can't forget it. Nothing would have happened without him. That's for sure. Wow. Strong words there from Jurgen Klopp. But England boss Thomas Tukul has warned Alexander Arnold he must improve defensively if he wants to be involved more for England. This comes after Tul named him in the squad for England's upcoming games against Andor and Sagal. Yeah. Well, this is what the England manager had to say. I can see that sometimes he relies heavily on his offensive contributions and gives not so much emphasis on the defensive discipline and effort. this major impact that he had for Liverpool over so many years. If he wants to have this impact in the English national team, then he has to take the defensive part very very seriously. Because when we are talking especially about qualifying football and then tournament football, then one defensive error, the one moment where you're not 100% awake, can be decisive, can be the moment where you pack your suitcases and go home. We will put this all into consideration, but now is the moment to feel him for nine or 10 days. Feel him around the squad. see what he can do. I think Trent has has certainly got a warning ringing in his ears that he has to focus more on his on his defending. I think we know that he's going to Real Madrid with the you know the desire to become the Balandor winner the first he said the first right back to win the Balandor. We know that Trent's strengths are his attacking game. So if he thinks he's going to Real Madrid to to kind of make that even better and and you know create lots of assists and be part of a winning team by playing more on the offensive side. Well, Thomas Tukul just said, ""Look, I want you to defend and if you don't defend, there's plenty of options. You know, obviously a lot of them can't stay fit."" Reys James being obvious one, but at right back England have got a wealth of talent and he has to show that he can do both sides of the game and Tul today has made that clear and he's been pretty strong in his comment. Well, back to Klopp and he will be among many Liverpool greats at their final game of the season against Crystal Palace tomorrow as the champions prepare to lift the Premier League trophy in front of what will be a jubilant Anfield crowd. Yeah, certainly will be. The trophy will be presented by Liverpool legend Alan Hansen who makes his Anfield return after a battle with ill health which saw him hospitalized last year. celebrations will be a stark contrast to when they won the title during the pandemic when no fans were allowed in the stadium to watch the trophy presentation and preparations as you can imagine are also well underway for their victory parade taking place on bank holiday Monday. The open top bus getting the full champions treatment. The parade kicks off at 2 in the afternoon and is expected to last up to 5 hours. Imagine the party might even go long on longer than that. Yeah, I reckon it will. Final day of the season sees the Premier League champions take on the FA Cup winners, Crystal Palace, precursor to the Charity Shield, before Liverpool are presented with the trophy. You can see that live from 3:00 on Sky Sports Premier League. That was a really interesting interview that with Yogen Klopp, wasn't it? And not only those incredible comments in defense of Alexander Arnold, but he also has dismissed any speculation that he is about to return to football management. Yeah, Klopp is currently Red Bull's head of global football and admitted he isn't missing his job in management. I miss people I work together with friends I I I I love and stuff like this, but you know in all this world at least we can meet each other as often as we want. Um don't miss the job to be 100% honest. um still not um whatever you read in the newspapers for the next at least 2 3 years if there's any footballing coaching job just you can be the first who says that's so so you're not going to Rome I don't not going to Rome yay I was the last one probably you realize because I got messages in the morning Rome is a nice city and I thought yeah but I heard that before but I yeah I'm just going to get you to say that again so if we hear a rumor Yeah, for the next two to three years and the plan is for forever but I always say yeah but yeah I'm not changing my mind like now and now and now. So I what I'm doing right now I really like [Music]",0.05,0.785,0.165,0.9996

And the Democratic leader late today who said this gift screams national security risk. It is a bribe in broad daylight. Also tonight, the confrontation in the Oval Office. President Trump ambushing the president of South Africa who denied the unsubstantiated claims of a white genocide. The president of South Africa saying, ""I'm sorry, I don't have a plane to give you."" Tonight, the storms hitting the Northeast. Gusting winds, heavy rain, and then this Nor Easter building right behind it. DC up through New York City to Boston bracing for these storms just as millions travel for the holiday. Lee Goldberg has the forecast. Tonight, two women now under arrest, accused of helping those fugitives who escaped at that massive jailbreak. What police say the women did to help them avoid capture.

Will it be safe for people to visit or will it go to the highest bidder? Tonight, the decision is in on the future of the tush push. And Deborah Roberts is here with the school children getting the chance to star in a Disney musical from ABC News World Headquarters in New York. This is World News Tonight with David Mure. Good evening. It is great to have you with us here on a very busy Wednesday night. We begin tonight with the Pentagon officially accepting that controversial gift, the $400 million jet from Cutter that President Trump plans to use as Air Force One. The president tonight rejecting criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. The luxury jet called the flying palace. The White House says it will serve as Air Force One carrying the president. But first, American taxpayers will pay for the major security overhaul of that jet. And late today, amid the news that this $400 million jet has now been accepted. The Democratic leader who called this a bribe in broad daylight that screams national security risk. And many asking, why does the United States need to turn to a foreign country for Air Force One? Jonathan Carl leading us off tonight. Tonight, the Trump administration is making it official, announcing they will accept that lavish gift from the government of Qatar, a $400 million luxury jet that's been called a flying palace. They're giving the United States Air Force a jet. Okay. And it's a great thing. The Pentagon saying the gift is quote in accordance with all federal rules and regulations and that the plane will eventually serve as Trump's Air Force One. Before that happens, American taxpayers will have to pay for a costly makeover to ensure the jet poses no security risks and will be able to function as the president's plane. The Pentagon says it will quote work to ensure proper security measures and functional mission requirements are considered. The Secretary of the Air Force telling Congress the process is already underway. The Secretary of Defense has directed the Air Force to uh basically start planning to modify the aircraft. That process could take months or even years. As ABC News first reported, Attorney General Pam Bondi signed off on a plan for the Air Force to accept the plane as a gift and then transfer ownership to Trump's Presidential Library Foundation shortly before he leaves office. It's unclear if that's part of the final agreement. The Pentagon referred questions to the Air Force. The Air Force saying, quote, ""Details related to the contract are classified."" The president was in cutter just last week where he heaped praise on its leader. This is an outstanding man. He's a great man and uh we're going to help each other. He has rejected questions about whether this is legal and ethical and why the United States needs to accept this new Air Force One as a gift from another country. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, ""No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane."" And late today, outrage from the Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. This gift screams national security risk. It is bribery in broad daylight. Donald Trump is thumbming his nose at Republicans and practically daring them to stop him. Some of the president's Republican allies have also raised concerns that made it clear they don't like accepting this gift either. As for that question about the president's library, I just spoke to White House press secretary Caroline Levit who told me the plane is still intended to go to the library, but the details about how it will be transferred and when have not yet been ironed out. And David, we believe this plane is already here in the United States. The gift is already here. John Carl leading us off here tonight in New York. John, thank you. In the meantime, we turn to the dramatic scene in the Oval Office today. The tense confrontation, President Trump ambushing the president of South Africa. The president of South Africa there to talk trade and to try to reset relations between the US and South Africa. President Trump at one point calling for the lights to be dimmed and playing a video and then showing a stack of papers that he said were articles proving a white genocide. The president of South Africa denying the unsubstantiated claims at one point saying to President Trump, ""I'm sorry, I don't have a plane to give you."" Here's Mary Bruce. Tonight, an extraordinary scene in the Oval Office. President Trump ambushing the president of South Africa with false claims the nation is engaged in genocide against white farmers. President Siril Ramaposa said he came to the White House to discuss trade. We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa. But Trump had other ideas. A lot of people are very concerned with regard to South Africa and that's really the purpose of the meeting. The president insists white South African farmers are being persecuted and murdered on a mass scale. Unproven claims that have been amplified by Elon Musk, a native of South Africa. Though Trump's administration has banned all refugees, they are now making an exception for one group, white South Africans. A plane load arriving in the US just last week. We have had a tremendous number of people, especially since they've seen this, uh, generally they're white farmers and they're fleeing South Africa. Reporters asking Trump what it will take to convince him there is no genocide. The South African president jumping in. What will it take from you for you to be convinced that there's no white genocide in South Africa? Well, I can answer that for president. It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends. Like, but Trump with the cameras rolling, turn the lights down. Dimming the lights to present what he claims is evidence, showing clips of extremists calling for violence, then leafing through articles he says prove it's happening. Death. Death. Death. Horrible death. Death. I don't know. But you know, pick anyone. White South Africans are fleeing because of the violence and racist laws. There is a crime problem in South Africa, but there is no evidence it is racially motivated or amounts to genocide. White people make up only 7% of the country, but own the vast majority of its farmland. Ramaposa adamant that the video does not represent his government. There is criminality in our country. People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only white people. Majority of them are black people. South Africa's president then joking that he wishes he could be like Qatar and gift Trump a luxury jet. I'm sorry I don't have a plane to give you. I I wish you did. Okay. I wish. And tonight, the spokesman for the South African president telling us of the confrontation, quote, ""It was expected. We knew that whenever heads of state come to the White House, you get a bit of a show. And again, David, he insisted there is no genocide in South Africa. David, Mary Bruce at the White House. Mary, thanks again. Now to the storm set to hit the Northeast, then the Noraster building right behind it. Washington DC right up through New York City to Boston bracing for these storms just as millions of course travel for the Memorial Day holiday. So, let's get right to chief meteorologist Lee Goldberg of our New York station WABC here in New York tracking it all for us tonight. Hi Lee. Hey David. a noraster hitting on a huge travel day. It already feels like March here in New York City. We're tracking heavy rain coming out of Pennsylvania. The tornado watch in Pittsburgh expired, but there's still a flash flood warning after over 2 ines of rain. That band of rain moves to DC, Philly, New York City during the overnight. It promises a really wet morning commute along the I95 quarter. Then the noraster starts to intensify and New England takes the brunt later in the day. Heavy rain, maybe some wind gust to 50 m an hour, some coastal flooding. The storm is very slow to depart on Friday. Even some mountain snows in northern New England and lingering showers right back down to Boston, even New York. It's going to keep the cool temperatures right in through the holiday weekend. David. All right, Lee Goldberg with us tonight. Lee, thanks as always. We turned out of that massive jailbreak in Louisiana tonight. Two women are under arrest now, accused of helping the fugitives who escaped. What police say the women did to help them avoid capture. Faith Abubet from New Orleans. Tonight, two women arrested and charged for allegedly helping multiple fugitive inmates evade capture after that stunning jailbreak in New Orleans. We have said this from Friday and and will continue to say it over and over again. If you help them, you will be prosecuted. Police say Courtney Harris was in contact with one inmate before that escape early Friday morning. Harris accused of transporting two escapees to multiple locations and Corvante Baptist accused of getting 19-year-old Cory Boyd food while he was hiding. Overnight, authorities arresting Boyd at his grandmother's house. So far, only five of the 10 fugitives have been recaptured. And tonight, an alleged victim opening up about the moment he learned the suspect in this case had escaped, asking ABC to only use his voice for safety reasons. I was thinking about getting out of town because this guy could come back and look look for my address and come in and shoot me, you know, on a couch. Four jail workers have been suspended and a jail plumber, Sterling Williams, is now behind bars, accused of helping the inmates carry out the largest jailbreak in Louisiana history. And David, just moments ago, Sterling's attorney denying that his client helped those inmates, telling us that the deputy in the cell asked him to shut off the water to that cell eventually used as the escape route and he was just doing his job. David Faith Abubet on this story again tonight. Faith, thank you. Tonight, President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson mounting a pressure campaign to try to get the president's tax cut and spending bill passed. Some Republican holdouts remain concerned over projections that President Trump's bill could add trillions to the deficit over the next decade. ABC's Jay O'Brien on the Hill again tonight. Tonight, a lastditch effort from President Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson turning up the heat on more than a dozen House Republican holdouts to pass the mega bill full of the president's campaign promises from tax cuts to border security. Doing very well. It's very close. The White House warning tonight failure to pass the bill would be a betrayal. Why aren't the holdouts listening to you and the president? They are. There's a lot of listening and a lot of discussion. It's been very productive. Officially called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the package extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, lifts federal income tax on tips and overtime, and earmarks nearly $50 billion to resume construction of the border wall. It slashes federal spending by more than$ 1.5 trillion dollars, including cuts to food assistance and Medicaid, which could leave more than eight million Americans without health insurance over a decade. But GOP hardliners pushing for even steeper cuts, angered the bill would add trillions to the deficit over the next 10 years. The president wants this passed now, but it's not done yet. And Speaker Johnson signaling he's moving ahead with a full House vote as soon as tonight or tomorrow morning. He can only afford to lose three Republicans. David, you'll be tracking it for us. Jay O'Brien tonight, Jay, thank you. That budget uncertainty Jay reports on adding to investor concerns today on Wall Street. The Dow falling nearly 817 points, down almost 2%. Those projected budget deficits on Capitol Hill, leading to a spike in bond yields, also fueling concerns. Tonight, a federal judge finding the Trump administration quote unquestionably violated his court order by suddenly deporting eight migrants to a third country, possibly somewhere in Africa, possibly South Sudan. DHS acknowledged putting the eight migrants on a plane, but have refused to reveal where they would end up. Judge Brian Murphy finding the men were given little more than 24 hours notice, which he determined was undeniably insufficient under his earlier due process ruling. He did not issue an order to return the deportiz, but said he would require the administration to quote remedy this violation. Tonight, the Department of Justice moving to end federal oversight of the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments. It comes nearly 5 years now after the deaths of George Floyd and Bana Taylor sparked nationwide protests and calls for police reform. Both cities reached agreements to implement changes. When we come back here tonight, the disturbing images this evening, authorities seizing more than 300 animals from a park safari right here in the US. Also tonight, the measel scare following a major soldout concert right outside New York City. What authorities are now saying. And tonight, the real estate battle now brewing over Pope Leo's childhood home right here outside Chicago. This picture, will it be safe for people to visit or will it now go to the highest bidder? More in a moment. Tonight, authorities seizing more than 300 animals from a park safari in Brandon, Oregon. Wildlife officials say the animals, including lions, tigers, and camels, were neglected and had not received vet care. Animal rescue groups are now providing food and water. Tonight, the images of a dump truck slamming into a home in Woodbury Heights, New Jersey. The truck veering off the road, speeding right across front yards, crashing into the side of the house. The homeowner was injured and is now in stable condition. Incredible pictures there. Authorities believe the driver suffered a medical emergency. He is in stable condition as well. When we come back, there's news tonight of a measel scare for thousands of fans at a soldout concert outside New York City. In the NFL tonight, the future of the tush push has now been decided and the battle over Pope Leo's childhood home outside Chicago tonight. To the index of other news and tonight, health officials are now warning that thousands of concertgoers may have been exposed to measles during a Shakira concert at Metife Stadium just outside New York City on May 15th. That was last Thursday night. One person infected with measles was in the crowd. Authorities have not said where the person was sitting. A real estate showdown over Pope Leo I 14th's childhood home in Daltton, Illinois. His family owned the house for nearly 50 years. The current owners want to sell it at auction to the highest bidder. Village officials offering to buy it directly or take it through eminent domain. They want the house to be an historic site open to the public to visit. To the NFL tonight and the tush push will live on. NFL teams rejecting an attempt to ban the controversial but highly successful play, of course, made famous by the Philadelphia Eagles. The short yardage play where the quarterback is shoved forward by his teammates. The Eagles celebrating tonight with a two-word post, push on. When we come back here tonight, the school children learning from Broadway stars and getting a chance to star in their own Disney musical. Deborah Roberts behind the scenes tonight. ABC World News Tonight with David Mure, sponsored by Inspire. No mask, no hose, just sleep. Finally tonight, America Strong.

E6AR0pXv0qY,437494,27497,4000,Trump RUNS AWAY to HIDE on FRIDAY on DISASTER NEWS,20250523,"Donald Trump has been panic posting and losing all morning long. So, you know what that means? He's got to take a vacation. Donald Trump is running away from Washington DC to go golfing at his resort in Bedminster, New Jersey. Let's talk about his panic posting this morning. He's attacking the European Union saying that he's going to impose 50% tariffs on them. Okay, Donald, haven't you said that before? Donald Trump is attacking the American company Apple and Tim Cook saying that he is going to impose a 25% tariff on Apple. Okay, Donald, didn't you say that the countries are going to eat the tariffs? I guess that's not true. Donald Trump is attacking the United Kingdom for having quote unsightly windmills, but he says our negotiated deal is going strong. You didn't do a deal with the United Kingdom, Donald. you had some BS memorandum of understanding and when you actually looked at the bottom of it, it says this is not a binding deal and all you did was give preferential treatment to Rolls-Royce, Jaguar and Land Rover over American car manufacturers who would be tariffed at a higher rate based on their production plants in Mexico and Canada under the USMCA, United States, Canada, and Mexico agreement that you negotiated back in 2017. The markets don't like this. A disaster this morning. As of this recording, the Dow is down almost 1%, the S&P is down almost 1%, the Nasdaq is down over 1%. More Trump manufactured disasters or as I believe what is also taking place here, market manipulation. And we need to make the connections here as well that last night Donald Trump held that private crypto dinner for the 220 people or entities mostly from foreign countries. We don't have that list of people who are enriching Donald Trump by buying his BS meme coins. So Donald Trump has that meeting. We don't get the list. You have Trump's propagandist Caroline Levit say, ""Oh, that's his personal time. That's his personal time. So, we're not going to let you know which foreign people he's meeting with. Oh, yeah. By the way, on the same day that the MAGA Republicans put forward this disastrous budget bill that's going to kick off tens of millions of Americans from Medicaid, people are going to lose their Medicare, also supplemental nutrition assistance program, uh, rental assistance. So while all of that is going on, then the next day Donald Trump posts all of these attacks against the European Union, against the United Kingdom, against Apple, knowing that's going to tank the market. Who is making the money off of shorting the market? Who's making money when Donald Trump then doesn't do the tariffs? There's a lot of insiders who are making millions and billions of dollars while regular folks are getting absolutely screwed. And then as Donald Trump's taking his vacation today, must be nice, running away to go golf while he sets the United States on fire. We also got a major federal order uh with Donald Trump's plans to deport all foreign students who go to Harvard. the Trump regime through their homeland security dog killer, cosplayer uh secretary Christy Gnome announced that uh that Harvard would not have the ability to um have international students study at the university anymore. And if you were an international student and you attended Harvard, you lose your status uh as you lose your visa and you get immediately deported. Whether that's back to your home country, to concentration camps in El Salvador, South Sudan, who knows? A federal judge just moments ago ruled against the Trump regime. Judge Burroughs has granted Harvard's restraining order in record time. The Trump regime just got smacked down, barring the regime from terminating its foreign student population and deporting them cruy and torturing them as part of this vendetta against Harvard because that the Trump regime wants to destroy all of America's top universities. and Harvard would not agree to allow the Trump regime to audit the political views of its student body and faculty and eliminate all diversity programs uh at Harvard. Uh Donald Trump, I guess on his personal time, Trump Media is coming up with another scheme to make more money to personally enrich Donald Trump. They're coming out with Trump brokerage accounts with an ETF put uh these exchange funds. So they want to basically say, ""Here's a set of funds that are Trump approved. You want to invest in our ETF, our kind of aggregated fund. I wonder how those stocks are going to do and the percentage that Donald Trump's personally going to try to make off of manipulating the market."" Like this is going on in plain view, folks. The company owned by a president who is already pushing the boundaries between business and public office is getting into the fun business. Okay, Bloomberg, maybe you want to make that headline a little more direct. They're not pushing the boundaries. They're breaking the freaking law every single day is what they are actually doing. Should we hear from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant on this disastrous Friday while Donald Trump's out there golfing and we can understand why you are torturing tens of millions of Americans, hundreds of millions of Americans with this disastrous bill and also that it's going to add trillions and trillions to the deficit. This is the most fiscally irresponsible bill in the history of the United States and it is deeply cruel and the only people it benefits are Donald Trump's oligarch friends who he's going vacationing with and golfing with. So Scott Bessent himself who's basically a billionaire. I think he's worth over $500 million. He lived in a pink mansion that looked like Barbie's Malibu house. I'm not making that up. In Charleston, South Carolina, I think it was valued at like $22 million. Must be nice. Scott Bessant. He says that the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan group, CBO, which the Republicans used to always cite all the time, which claims there's going to be trillions of dollars added, that this is the most fiscally irresponsible budget ever. Scott Bess's like, well, I think that um that there are that that's DC style that's a DC style math. Here, play this clip. You mentioned economic growth here in your comment there. This bill adds trillions to our debt. How is that acceptable to this administration? Well, again, the you're referring to the CBO scoring, I believe, which is tenure scoring, and it's DC style scoring. So, we think that we can both grow the economy and control the debt. And what's important, Bill, is that the economy grows faster than the debt. So what I would tell your viewers to focus on is what I'm focused on is what Secretary Yellen was focused on is what is the total debt to GDP because we can grow our way out of this that if we change the growth trajectory the of the country of the economy then we will stabilize our finances and grow our way out of this. This guy is the most arrogant arrogant outofouch person imaginable. So then Fox asked Bessant, ""So you said you were going to roll out all of these deals. You said there would be a deal with Japan. There doesn't seem to be a deal with Japan. Who are you doing deals with?"" Um, we're pretty far along when it comes to India. We're doing deals with India. Here, play this clip on the tariffs that you mentioned. You had a lot of discussions in Canada. Japan was a part of that. You've talked about Japan a lot. If the Japanese are not is is not the next country to do a deal, who is? As I mentioned before, we're far along with India and they got in early on. Uh many of the Asian countries uh have come with very good deals. So there are 18 important trading partners and I would say with the exception of the EU, most are negotiating in very good faith. Who do you think goes first? Uh Bill, you know, we're going to have to see. Is it a summer battle? Do we take this into the fall? And if we take it into the fall, are we talking about 2026 with the to do a deal with you can announce publicly with the EU? you with the EU, which would happen with anybody, you you pick it. Uh, look, look, these these these deals are moving quickly and I I think as we approach the end of the 90-day period, we're going to see more and more of them announced. Okay. Is that July then? I I think that's that's the 90 days. Okay. So, we will look for that then. On by the way, they keep on citing India. You know who that's pissing off? India. I've been showing you videos. Go back to the video I did. I call it pissed off India responds to the Trump regime. We have the India foreign minister saying we don't know what the hell they're talking about. We're only going to do things in the interest of India and we're sick and tired of the Trump regime one doing crypto deals with Pakistan is what the guy from India is saying too. And also stop trying to use us and act like you're going to be able to exploit us or just dangle trade as a way for us to seed our sovereignty. That's what's going on in India right now and it's why we cover the international news right here. And here Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant um I guess addresses this uh attack on Apple and then he's being asked like um well Donald Trump's attacking Apple and says that they need to have manufacturing plants in the United States but that's going to take a long time to build. Like what are you talking about here? Play this clip on Apple. There is more news too on that. Okay here we go on True Social an hour ago. I've long informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones will be sold in the United States of America, will be manufactured and built in the US, not India or any place else. If that's not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the United States. So, we've got two tariff threats in about 10 minutes time. I understand that Tim Cook was at the White House this week. Did that conversation not go well? Uh, again, I I wasn't in on that conversation. I I also saw 10 this week. So you know again the the president is trying to bring back precision manufacturing to the US and uh you know I think that one of our greatest vulnerabilities you are the these ex is this external production especially in semiconductors and a large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors. So, we would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure. What I found interesting in Saudi Arabia last week was that the president called out Tim Cook for not being there. Now, you know that high technology companies, it takes time to move those production facilities. What's realistic for Apple? Again, I I I don't know from company to company. So, you know, we'll we'll have to see. I do think that Apple started moving a big portion of their supply chain out of China during COVID when China proved to be, you know, an unreliable partner. Okay. So, we'll see where that goes in waiting a reply perhaps from Tim Cook and maybe that comes today. CNBC asks a MAGA Republican Congress member uh a question here about Donald Trump saying he's going to recommend a 50% tariff on the EU. Who who is he recommending that to here? Play this clip. To the US. In in the language this morning, the president said that he was going to recommend a 50% tariff starting 50 starting on June 1st. Who's he recommending that to the Senate? I mean, if if it's not an emergency, if it's not a fentanyl situation, does he have the authority? Recommending it to himself. Yeah. I think his pitch is you're not at the table. We need you at the table. We made progress in the United Kingdom on a step one deal that I hope leads to a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom personally. The the and we now have a breakdown of who's going to be losing money the most, who's going to be hit hardest under this uh budget bill right now. Um so if you are making over $4 million, you're going to get you're going to save about $390,000 on your taxes. if you make about $4.325 million a year. But for Americans who are making between 17,000 and 51,000 uh dollars or from $0 to 51,000, you're going to lose like a,000 bucks. So, I just want to be clear, they are literally taking $1,000 out of the pockets of people making between $0 and $51,000. So all of those people so that they can give it to people making above $4.2 million to help them make more money. Do you all see what is happening here based on this breakdown? And by the way, it's going to be a big that's just the direct hit that you're going to take. You see right away and that doesn't that doesn't even go to show you what's going to happen when people are losing their jobs or they're off health care and all of those costs which are going to bankrupt millions and millions of people. So yes, Donald Trump's going golfing. And then he goes, ""The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States and trade, has been very difficult to deal with."" Wow. They're powerful trade barriers. W He goes, ""Our discussions with them are going nowhere. They're going nowhere. Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% tariff on the European Union starting on June 1, 2025."" All right, boy. Who cried wolf? Just go away. Just stay on the golf course and just shut the f up. Seriously, you whiny, pathetic, vile felon. You just go away. I have a long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones will be sold in the United States, that they will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India or any place else. You think that's how you're going to do a trade deal with India? You think India is going to like that you're saying that Apple can't do business in India or build manufacturing plants and you want to do a trade deal with India? Do y'all realize what stupid negotiators you are? That's your plan with India for real. Our negotiated deal with the United Kingdom is going very strongly. But I I don't like these unsightly windmills and incentivize my Dude, just shut up. I have an idea. Donald, just stop posting. You You're a felon. You're a sexual abuser. You're a criminal. You're trash. Just go golf. Go golf. Go away. And just just if you did nothing, things would be sign. Just do nothing. Do nothing. In fact, I I I will stop mocking you for golfing if you just stay there and golf. Do nothing because that will be better than the catastrophe you're inflicting on this country.

White House doctors may have missed the early stages of his prostate cancer. So, is President Trump worried about the quality of care that presidents get here? Not as far as President Trump is concerned. The uh White House physician we have here is phenomenal and the team of physicians that take care of the president, particularly at Walter Reed Medical Center, are great. The president had his physical recently, as you know. He had uh perfect results. He's in very good shape. I think those of you who traveled to the Middle East with us last week can attest to the president's endurance. And by the way, I will add, we returned home from a very long and tiring trip last week. And on Saturday, where was the president? In the Oval Office working all day. He doesn't stop.

ZFYzbtH3Fc8,522389,7988,1400,Why Russian troops are massing near Ukraine's 'fortress city',20250524,"Kev came under a sustained drone attack and missile attack last night lasting 7 hours. Reportedly, 250 drones were used and 14 ballistic missiles. It sent the population again underground into the tube stations to shelter for most of the night. And there are indications that there were other attacks in other parts of Ukraine in the south and further east and as far west as Odessa. So that uh air operation on the Russians part goes on. But the Ukrainians hit back themselves on Yellets last night. Uh they claimed to have hit a battery factory on the Russian side of the border deep inside Russia in fact at Yellets. And the battery factory creates batteries, manufactures batteries for missiles. And so Yellet itself is a not a particularly important town, but the battery factory is because without batteries, Russia's ballistic and cruise missiles can't easily operate. We have no idea how much damage the Ukrainians might have done to Yellet's battery factory. They claimed that they had a big hit on it, but we'll see. But if they were able to interrupt the supply of batteries to missiles, then arguably they can do something about the number of ballistic and cruise missiles that are being targeted against Ukraine more or less now on a nightly basis. Meanwhile, the ground war goes on and attention at the moment is concentrated on Kharkiv and the area in the north of of Ukraine. Kharkiv is the second city. It's only less than 20 miles away from the border and reportedly the Russians are massing troops on their side of the border. Ukrainians have been talking about this for several weeks now and the expectation is that they're going to launch some sort of offensive in the north against the Khakiv area and further northwest against Sunumi which is another major city in the north of Ukraine. Almost certainly the Russians won't be able to take Khiv. It's the second city. It's a big city. They never got really near to taking it in 2022 when they really did try. Nor can they probably take Sum. we have cities. But what they probably can do is actually get over the border and begin to put pressure all the way along this border. What the Russians say, and they've making this fairly clear in Putin's statements, is that they want a buffer zone all the way along the front to protect them from Ukrainian attacks. From a military point of view, that's neither here nor there. It's not what they want. What they want to do is to create pressure along the border to pin Ukrainian forces in place so that those Ukrainian forces can't go further south where they're now badly needed for the summer offensives which the Russians are also pursuing in the south. And the other reason that they might want forces on the Ukrainian side of the border is it gives them a foot in the Khakiv oblas the Khakiv region and the Sunumi region. And if they have a foot in those regions, then in any future negotiations, and we're a long way from them at the moment, but in any future negotiations, they will say, ""We're already in those regions. We will keep that footprint."" And of course, we want more, just as we want more in the four other oblasts that we have a footprint in, but we haven't fully conquered. So, the politics of this overlays all of the military activity. And not least, the politics of this comes into the prisoner exchange, which is ongoing at the moment. Yesterday about 500 prisons were exchanged on each side, 500 each. And today another 350 odd on each side. We expect these prisoner exchanges to go on again tomorrow until both sides have exchanged a thousand prisoners as they agreed to do last weekend at the Istanbul summit. This is all good in itself. It's a humanitarian gesture. Both sides want it. But in reality, it doesn't take us any nearer to a ceasefire. In fact, if we think about it logically, we are probably further away from a ceasefire now in Ukraine than we were about a month ago.",0.088,0.871,0.041,-0.9912
3QKhKLyt9Yw,556631,5202,803,Nightly News Full Broadcast - May 16,20250517,"Breaking news as we come on the air tonight. Reports of tornadoes and intense severe storms. And in New Orleans, the manhunt for 10 escaped inmates. In Louisiana, the inmates had made it out of jail overnight through a giant hole. Their escape not detected until hours later this morning. New surveillance video showing them running out of the facility and then running across an interstate in the dark. Police capturing one of the men in the heart of the French Quarter. Why the sheriff says there are indications they had help from the inside. Plus, severe storm damage in St. Louis. The damage reports coming in. A man being rescued from the rubble. That's on top of 11 tornadoes reported just a day before that toppled silos as ranchers herded cattle to safety.

Off the rails, the transit strike stranding tens of thousands of commuters in one of the busiest travel corridors in America. This is NBC Nightly News with Lester Hol. Good evening and welcome. Breaking news tonight. The New Orleans manhunt after nearly a dozen prisoners escape a jail near the city's French Quarter. Officials say the breakout took place overnight, though it took over two hours before the public was made aware. Their absence discovered during a headcount this morning. The sheriff saying the prisoners received assistance in their escape from individuals inside our department. The early investigation revealing they may have also taken advantage of low staffing, inoperable surveillance cameras, and defective locks. And new surveillance video shows the men escaping from the facility. Five of the men were being held on murder charges, one convicted. Officials tonight retracing their escape route. Let's get right to Pria Schrader now with the breaking news in the case. Good evening, Lester. Just moments ago, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office telling us that they captured another one of those 10 inmates, which means that now eight of them are still on the run. Tonight, an urgent manhunt ramping up for inmates considered by authorities as armed and dangerous. Still on the run, escaping from a jail two miles from New Orleans popular French Quarter. Five charged, one convicted of murder, most awaiting trial on serious felony counts. There is no way people can get out of this facility without there being some type of lapse in security. The sheriff revealing that Orleans Parish Justice Center was placed on a lockdown at 10:30 p.m. 10 inmates were able to exit their cells because of defective locks breaking through a door at 12:23 a.m. They then exited the jail at 10:01 a.m. through a hole in the wall behind a toilet seen in these photos. One photo showing writing that appears to say too easy. Authorities saying the inmates used toiletries to remove some of the bolts. New surveillance video released by the sheriff late today of several inmates trying to break open a door. You can see here the inmates escaping the facility through a dock door and running across the interstate. This morning after investigators became involved. They subsequently found clothing that they shed in that neighborhood. 7 and a half hours later, sheriff's deputies discovered the inmates missing at a routine morning headcount. According to the sheriff tonight, the sheriff saying short staffing in the jail and inoperable security cameras contributed to their escape. We have indication that these detainees received assistance in their escape from individuals inside of our department. The first inmate captured Kendall Miles was found earlier today. The sheriff's office saying deputies found him hiding beneath a car in a hotel parking garage in the French Quarter. Now the sheriff's department facing scrutiny about how this could have happened. There were supervisors on duty. There were lower level folks on duty. And they all had a job to do. The state attorney general calling for a full investigation, writing on X, quote, ""Someone clearly dropped the ball and there's no excuse for this."" Authorities also scouring the public for any information and also offering this warning. If there is anyone who is harboring or helping these escapees, you will be charged. Three authorities just released new video of the escape. What is it show? The sheriff saying late tonight that three of their employees have been placed on administrative leave. Authorities are also offering up to a $5,000 reward for any information that will lead to the inmates capture. The police chief also said earlier today that she's offering protection for any of the victims of these men's alleged crimes and also any witnesses who may have been preparing to testify in their upcoming trials. Lester Pretty sure there tonight. Thank you. And there's breaking news out of Missouri tonight where reports of severe damage are starting to come in after a tornado touched down inside the city of St. Louis. Maggie Vespa now with late details for us. Hey man, it's a tornado man. We're in the tornado. Oh, tonight, a new round of explosive storms with Missouri in the bullseye. Hail pummeling the area around St. Louis. And late today, at least one suspected tornado tearing through the heart of the city, wrecking homes, damaging a church, and downing trees. Firefighters saving a man from the basement of this collapsed building to cheers from his family. Well, he was up under two stories of house, so we didn't really like know if he was going to be okay. And we were just really just worried about him. And we're just relieved to know that he's alive. Staff huddling in the basement of city hall. Elsewhere, the twister leaving utter devastation. Everything start falling. The roof just fell in. The lights, the ceiling, all that stuff just fell down. This tap room in St. Louis torn to pieces. People inside telling our St. Louis affiliate, KSDK, they barely escaped with their lives. This man says someone at the last minute told him to move out of harm's way. If he wouldn't have told us to move, we would still been sitting there. We'd have been probably dead. Meanwhile, this apparent tornado crossing a highway in Kentucky and flash flooding sweeping across the Northeast with wild weather wreaking havoc at airports across the country, temporarily delaying or grounding flights in New York, DC, even Minneapolis. All of it adding to a chaotic week. Overnight in Michigan, sparks flying along power lines as violent storms knocked out power for hundreds of thousands. Oh my god. Yesterday's tornado outbreak spawning at least 11 reported twisters across the Midwest. Homes and buildings today left torn to shreds. It's just a mess. I don't know what I'm going to do. At this farm near Milwaukee. Here we go. Here we go. Got one. We got one. Dozens helping to move this herd of cows away from the damage as cleanup gets underway and more storms fire up tonight. And Maggie, as we say, things are developing as we're on the air here. We're getting word of injuries in St. Louis Lester, injuries and deaths. St. Louis's mayor just confirming four people have died. Also, a hospital spokesperson telling us 10 children have been admitted. One is in critical condition. Lester Maggie Vasper, thank you. Let's get to Bill Karen's already a very volatile night of weather. This could get worse. Lester, we've already had tornado warnings in seven different states, including metropolitan areas of Baltimore, and of course, we saw what just happened in St. Louis. This threat will continue through the afternoon, well into this evening, and even after midnight. The area of greatest concern is going to be here heading through Kentucky, Indiana, and eventually even northern Tennessee. This hatched area is where we could see additional strong tornadoes, and we're especially watching these storms that just exited Paduca heading towards Bowling Green. As far as tomorrow goes, isolated severe storms, a break for the areas getting hit today. But watch out in Dallas Fort Worth. We could have strong storms, maybe isolated tornadoes later on tomorrow afternoon. And then on Sunday, we do it all again. Things ramp right back up and we're going to have another severe weather outbreak with tornadoes likely in the plains as we head towards Sunday and Monday. All right, Bill Carage, thank you. New Jersey is home to the third largest public transit system in the country, but a strike today has driven all of its trains, including uh in New York City to a screeching halt. Emily Aeta has details with hundreds of train engineers off the job and now on the picket line. What do I want? Tonight, commuter chaos in the country's most populated region. So, how much longer is your commute now? Like 40 minutes. Tens of thousands who rely daily on New Jersey Transit trains left scrambling today as the sprawling train system that stretches into Philadelphia across the Garden State and New York City came to a standstill. Train scheduling boards today blank. Parking lots outside of stations completely empty and platforms eerily quiet. Now my husband is going to be skipping work to come pick me up, drive me home. The strike is the first of its kind in New Jersey in more than four decades and the culmination of a year'slong battle over wages. The union contends their engineers haven't received a pay bump in more than 5 years and make at least $10 less per hour than their counterparts at other train services. We'd rather be running trains. We'd rather be working to be perfectly honest with you. The governor alongside New Jersey Transit CEO says they support wage increases that won't blow up the AY's budget, calling on the union to negotiate in good faith. It is frankly a mess of their own making. And it is a slap in the face of every commuter and worker who relies on NJ Transit. But between the fingerpointing, commuters are caught in the chaos as travel throughout the already congested New York City area is derailed. The union tells me negotiations are expected to resume on Sunday. If an agreement is not reached, you can expect those commuter wos to worsen since more people tend to work from home on Fridays. Lester. Okay, Emily, thank you. Lawyers for Shaun Diddy Combmes questioned Cassie Ventura again today, trying to paint the music mogul's ex-girlfriend as a willing participant in their often toxic relationship. Khloe Bolos reports from the courthouse. In her final day on the stand, Cassie Ventura spoke again about the day Colmes brutally beat her in a hotel hallway in 2016. Ventura, who is potentially days away from giving birth, testifying that Comolmes was blackout at the time of the assault from drugs and alcohol. At one point reading a text she sent him after the violent attack. I am not a ragd doll. I am someone's child. Following 20 hours of testimony this week, her attorney, Douglas Wigdor, speaking outside the courthouse, reading a statement from Ventura. I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear. Today's cross-examination focusing heavily on Ventur's allegation that Cols raped her in 2018 after they had ended their relationship, which he denies. The defense showing text messages between the former couple the day after the alleged rape, including one in which Ventur sent a heart emoji to Combmes. Combmes's team also trying to poke holes in Ventur's timeline. That is not the gotcha moment that defense attorneys think it is. I mean, at the end of the day, witnesses are not great on specific dates, particularly when they go back years ago. The defense also pointing to a text exchange between Ventura and Colmes from 2012 in which she wrote, ""I don't want to freak off for the last time. I want it to be the first time for the rest of our lives."" At times today, the defense appeared to struggle to maintain momentum, facing frequent objections by prosecutors and regularly stopping Ventur's questioning to whisper together. Commes appeared to be actively involved, passing his lawyers notes. In a striking exchange with Col's lawyers, Ventur saying, despite it all, I don't hate him. I have love for the past and what it was. We also saw musician Don Rashard take the stand. She says that she saw Combmes be violent with Ventura. Combmes denies all of the allegations against him. Lester Chloe Milos, thank you. Former FBI director James Comey facing an investigation tonight after he posted a now deleted photo that Trump allies say calls for the president's assassination. Gabe Gutierrez is at the White House. And Gabe, the Secret Service is now involved. Yes, Lester. A law enforcement official confirms James Comey will be interviewed by the Secret Service in person tonight. The agency says it takes rhetoric like this very seriously. While President Trump said today the former FBI director was calling for his assassination and knew it. This is the image Comey shared on social media. What he described as a shell formation on a beach that formed the numbers 8647. Trump allies saying 86 meant not just getting rid of but assassinating the 47th president. Comey, of course, was fired during Trump's first term and became an outspoken Trump critic. Comey explains he thought it was a political message, not a violent one, adding quote, ""I oppose violence of any kind, so I took the post down."" Lester. Okay, Gabe, thank you. The death toll is rising after Israel launched a new series of strikes in Gaza. It comes as President Trump is on the way home from his Middle East trip and says many civilians in Gaza are starving. Here's Matt Bradley. Tonight, a new wave of Israeli strikes in Gaza. Israel's military says it struck over 150 terror targets. An effort it says to defeat Hamas and pressure the group to release more hostages. But for Gazins, it's one of the bloodiest days in months. The Hamas run health ministry says the air strikes killed at least 250 people in 36 hours. About half of them children with thousands displaced. All of it as President Trump wraps up his M East trip, receiving lavish welcomes in three countries aimed at strengthening ties with the Arab world. We have to help also out the Palestinians. You know, a lot of people are starving on Gaza, so we have to look at both sides. Israel has blockaded all outside aid for the past 10 weeks. Aid agencies warned the population is on the verge of famine. In addition to the relentless toll of Israel's offensive, this was once a family home in southern Gaza. Wednesday night, an Israeli air strike destroyed it, killing 10 members of the Zenati family, including the entire family of Ree's uncle. My cousin's name is Mina. She said she was one year younger than me. And just yesterday, she was with me. And tonight, we've learned the Trump administration is working on a plan to potentially relocate up to a million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Libya. Five people with knowledge of the effort have told NBC News. But the details are still murky and no agreement has been reached yet. Lester. All right, Matt Bradley, thanks. We'll be back in 60 seconds. A massive multi-vehicle fire that temporarily shut down the airport in Jacksonville. Plus, a pregnant mother on life support and required to have her baby. Her family's emotional appeal over a controversial law coming up. Back now to a case in Georgia. A mother there is saying her brain deadad daughter is being kept alive because she's pregnant, raising new questions about the state's strict abortion law. Laura Jared reports. It started with headaches. April Newkerk says her 30-year-old daughter, Adriana Smith, was pregnant with her second child when something started to go terribly wrong. They did a CT scan and she had blood clots all in her head. Speaking to NBC affiliate WXIA, Newkerk says soon after that, Adriana was declared brain dead by Emory Doctors. That was back in February, but she's still in the hospital, Newkerk says, on life support. The doctors haven't withdrawn because that would mean the unborn fetus Adriana still carries would also die. A potential violation of Georgia's strict abortion law. It's torture for me. I come here and I see my daughter breathing on a ventilator. She's not there. The law bans most abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy with narrow exceptions. Emory says it doesn't comment on patient cases, but the hospital uses quote individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia's abortion laws. It's all raising fresh questions about the reach of the law. Republican state senator Marty Harbin says he still supports it. We have already determined that she does not have life, but yet the baby does have life. The current plan, Newkerk says, is to keep Adriana alive until doctors can deliver the baby safely via C-section. For now, her mother waits. I'm not saying that we would have chose to terminate her pregnancy. What I'm saying is we should have had a choice. Laura Jarrett, NBC News. We'll take a short break. When we're back in a moment, the home that became historic overnight. The Pope's childhood house now up for sale. Why it may take a lot to win the auction. We're back now with a huge fire that temporarily shut down Jacksonville International Airport. The airport reopened this evening after this multi-vehicle fire in the parking garage closed the airport entirely and grounded flights for a few hours. Fire officials say the blaze spread to about 50 other vehicles. They say the situation there is now under control. And it's been a week since Pope Leo was elected. And now his childhood home is up for auction. The Pope's former home in the Chicago area was listed for less than $250,000 before it was taken off the market when he was elected. According to its listing, the three-bedroom, three-b home is being advertised as a piece of papal history. And that's nightly news for this Friday. Make sure to watch a newsy meet the press with Scott Bessent and Mike Pence. Thank you for watching. I'm Lester Hull. Please take care of yourself and each other. Good night. Thanks for watching.

tRar_1eBLHo,113045,0,1200,"SA-US Relations | WITS students react to Ramaphosa, Trump Oval office meeting",20250521,"Let's go live now to Vitz University in Bali Satani. Also part of the SABC team covering this developing story for you tonight in Bali and you've been getting the views of students there. What do the young people make of what we've just witnessed? Well, certainly Tigila as all eyes are on the Oval Office and the White House in Washington DC, a number of people have been glued to either their screens or even their radio stations trying to get a glimpse of what is taking place in the Oval Office and that follows that meeting which is currently underway uh between US President Donald Trump as well as President Sil Raapasa. the presidency characterizing this meeting as a meeting to reset relations between the two nations. And I'm now going to bring in some students here who have been camped outside this university monitoring proceedings taking place in Washington. Silus, thank you so much for your time this evening here in SABC News. Let's start off here. We've seen and heard this meeting take place. What are your thoughts so far on what is taking place and this very important meeting uh that president Ramapasa has gone all the way uh to Washington to sit down with uh US President Donald Trump. Thank you. Evening uh to the viewers at home. Look uh we can just take it back to say one. I think Donald Trump is being a propaganist as he is as always. he's still bringing the issues of uh white killings in South Africa and that's entirely not true. But secondly, I think our president is very clear to say that we're there for trade and investment and I think that's that is what is very important for our our country and our continent as a whole. So look at it like this. Africa is the second largest uh continent in the whole world. Asia has now been uh dominated by trade and everything else. China is growing in Asia. So now there needs to be a new central place where market can run. That's why now South Africa and Africa becomes the central point. That's why you see people like Rupert who are there in the at oval who are now looking at the stink look stinking was unleashed uh they started to space X started to release your satellites back in in into space for since 2019 and today they have right about 7,000 in in that space which means now they need to grow into a new market and a new market is where it's South Africa where there's potential it's Africa where there's potential we are still underdevelopment underdeveloped and indirectly this is going to impact our institutions like uh vets university here look the funding that was cut off by Trump affected uh our institutions most of the funding for our students in the health science site comes from the US which means our research has been impacted so Donald Trump has affected give other students a chance thank you so much for your time I'm also now going to bring So, so how do you think uh when you look at the rapport of the president and how he handled uh you know uh this meeting which was in front of all the cameras and in front of all the media. What do you make of how he handled himself and his rapport uh during uh this meeting? Well, good evening to all the viewers out there. Well, to be honest, I'm I'm actually somewhat disappointed in the manner of approach that S. Raaposa took first and foremost with the delegation that he took there. I mean the fact that you take most of the people that are owning companies like your vodiccoms I mean Rupert has got shares there. Sir himself has shares in MTN and these are the companies that when you think about it if Staling was to come to South Africa it would rival them and Stalink initially had wanted not to have a base here at which it can then foster growth in terms of jobs and job creation and the likes but instead it wanted to operate outside of South Africa. So now in that context when you see that happening you then become disappointed because it means that there's also the question of money involved because we we we we can only ask ourselves the question that with all the propaganda and all the intelligency that the US has in its disposal how do they think that there can be some sort of a genocide in South Africa it really doesn't make sense and when I look at it I think so Ramaposa a bit was allowed to he allowed himself to be paid by Trump in the sense that now he's putting himself off in a corner at which now America had to dictate everything. You do this, you do that, you speak to this man, you don't speak to him. And it's proven because Robert himself did say we need Starlight and Starlink and that only shows that there is still that capitalist agenda that is continuing to reshape and reform itself in South Africa. All right, thank you so much Tim. I'm also now going to bring in Angelique Timmy and uh Angelique maybe let's start off with and talk about what Timiso touched on and that was the delegation uh that was alongside or is alongside President Ramaposa uh during that meeting. I mean the likes of uh you know Robert as well. Uh we also know that Johan Rert is there. Uh we also know the likes of Gersie else is also forming part of this delegation. what do you make of those uh who are supporting uh the president during uh this visit? Um thank you Bali. So in terms of delegation I think that Ruperts as a as an undeniable and undisputed representative of the private sector is there as a form of economic um diplomacy and that is really good because it shows that this is not just political. We're actually looking for ways to advance ourselves not just economically but also in terms of our relations with other countries and obviously we're talking things like trade we're talking investments and success as the successful businessman that he is. Rert would have really really proper insights on that. And then in terms of the golfers, I think that they are more of a cultural leverage because it's no secret that Trump loves golf and um even the president taking both of them. They he asked for one of the two when he said actually I'll bring both of them. And I think that is a form of cultural leverage and he can use them as um a soft power tool in order to just maybe soften Trump up and let the defenses down cuz he's already praising them. is already giving them compliments and they also brought him a golf book. So, that's a very strategic development. I really do hope though that um behind all the golf smiles there is a proper strategy because these are all white men and they're not actually a representation of what South Africa looks like. We're one of the most unequal countries in the world. We have GBV, we have um black poverty, we also have um in inequality. We're known for inequality. So having these white men going out there to represent us might not be a true reflection of who we are as a country and that is a bit is a bit concerning. I just really do hope though that the meeting will be a success. All right. Thank you so much Angelique. I'm also going to bring in our last guest here. Hello Gamu. Your expectations now that we know that this meeting we've seen you know just a glimpse of that meeting. they they are now going to uh be behind closed doors to continue uh you know discussing some bilateral uh relations between these two countries. What are your expectations in terms of the outcomes of this meeting? Yeah, I think uh this is when the real meeting is going to start. Uh what we saw there was Donald Trump keeping to the lie that there's a white genocide in South Africa because he even brought in uh fake news from Twitter showing Julius Malama singing shoot the boy and was not willing to listen to anyone who was saying there is a crime problem in South Africa but there's no targeted um um um crime towards white farmers or white people in South Africa. And I also think that our president himself in front of in front of the world failed to dispel this myth that white people are being targeted. South Africa is one of the only countries where um those borders in including the 49 borders will live in a in a better state more than they they're living now as refugees in in in in um in in America. So I think we we are we're looking at um um the outcomes of saying that the AOA trade deal between the the USA and South Africa must still be there. the tariffs must stay at 10 at 10% um if not lower. We must be able to speak about um a relationship between the the USA and South Africa um that is beneficial to both parties. Our president failed to say what he said to us in parliament. He said he was not going to be bullied but that was just a spectacle of Trump perpetuating this idea in order for Stalin to come and for the USA to have a leverage over South Africa. Kam thank you so much for your time. Of course uh those are some of the views Tigil we are hearing here from uh some of the Vitz University students who've been monitoring uh those developments coming out from Washington DC some of them uh those views also being quite critical of the president in terms of how he handled themselves. You could have heard there Gamu saying that the president said that they will not be bullied and he seems to think that well the president was playing into the terrain or the the arena of the US president and failed uh you know to continue uh to highlight the notion that there is no such thing as a white genocide taking place in South Africa.

Several confirmed tornadoes touching down and a tornado watch has just been issued for the city of Chicago tonight and the surrounding areas. In fact, multiple states under tornado and severe weather alerts in the Midwest and millions then bracing for storms from Texas all the way up to the Northeast. Just some of the images coming in tonight. Just as we came on, the dark clouds gathering over Minneapolis. You can hear the tornado sirens right there, right across the city.

A dangerous afternoon and evening some of these storms moving into the northeast over the weekend. David Lee Goldberg, our thanks to you as well. Tonight we turn now to the trial of Shawn Diddy Combmes here in New York. Tonight, the cross-examination of the prosecution star witness, Shawn Combmes's ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. Defense lawyers today confronting her in court with messages that she and Combmes exchanged, challenging some of her claims. Aaron Kurski was at the courthouse on a warning again tonight. Some of this testimony is difficult. In hours of cross-examination, lawyers for Shawn Combmes using ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventur's own words in an attempt to portray her not as a victim of sex trafficking, but as a willing, even eager participant in his swinger's lifestyle. Hey, baby. In hush tones, eight months pregnant, and with her husband in the room, Ventura reading aloud intimate, often explicit text messages about the sex she desired. One juror appeared to shake her head. Others leaned in to read along. I'm always ready to freak off, one of her messages said, referencing the drugfueled sessions with male prostitutes that Ventura said became an integral part of her relationship with Colbmes. Defense attorneys harping on her apparent enthusiasm to make him happy you told him that you wanted to do freakoffs. Ventura pushed back, ""No, there's a lot more to that."" But the defense suggested Ventura became reluctant only when she felt dirty and grimy as opposed to sexual and spontaneous. As she said in one of her emails to Combmes, ""I get nervous that I'm just becoming the girlfriend that you get your fantasies off with and that's it."" Ventura testified Colmes coerced her into sex under threat of violence and blackmail. But on cross-examination, she said Combmes was also violent because of jealousy and her infidelity, telling the jury dating rapper Kid Cuddy and actor Michael B. Jordan prompted arguments that could be a little scary. Ventura kept up her composure through hours on the witness stand, David. And those will continue tomorrow, though the judge wants to make sure she's finished by the end of Friday because she could give birth at any moment. David, Eric Kacherki back at the courthouse again tonight. This evening, ABC News learning of a new and alarming air traffic control outage. This time, controllers in the Denver area losing communications with planes for some 90 seconds. This happened on Monday. This has already happened multiple times at Newark Airport. And tonight, an air traffic controller coming forward saying he saw two passenger jets here in the northeast just seconds away from a midair collision. Here's Gio Bonedz. Tonight, ABC News is learning about a new and alarming outage at an air traffic control center near Denver that left controllers unable to communicate with some planes for nearly 90 seconds. The FAA says two radio transmitters went down just before 2 p.m. Monday at a facility that handles planes flying above 18,000 ft in and around Colorado. Air traffic controllers quickly moving pilots to a backup radio channel. Are you on 1257? [Applause] What we have here really is radio failure that we've seen many times before and we're going to see it again until we change things around. But it was a very orderly procedure in terms of backing it up. This all comes after a series of tech issues at Newark's Liberty Airport. A systemwide outage back on April 28th at a Philadelphia facility causing air traffic controllers to lose radar and communications with planes packed with passengers for up to 90 seconds. And tonight, a controller at that facility now coming forward recounting the moment on May 4th when he saw two planes just seconds from colliding midair. Jonathan Stewart telling the Wall Street Journal he was manually keeping track in his notebook, worried that radar and radio communication might fail again. When he saw the two aircraft on a collision course, he instructed the pilots to turn the planes away from each other, but the incident leaving him badly shaken. Stuart says he took stress related trauma leave after the incident, adding, ""I don't want to be responsible for killing 400 people."" Meanwhile, David, the FAA has been meeting with the airlines for the past two days to figure out how many flights each airline must cut at Newark. We've just been told that meeting will go into a third day. David. All right, Gio Bonitz with us tonight. Gio, thank you. Now to the chilling case unfolding in Camden County, New Jersey. Police say a teenage daughter escaping her parents they say held captive for 7 years. Authorities say she was kept in a dog crate. She escaped running to a neighbor who said they hadn't seen her in years. Here's our chief justice correspondent, Pierre Thomas. Tonight, police say this was a house of horrors for an 18-year-old daughter allegedly held captive by her mother and stepfather for 7 years. Her parents accused of keeping her in a dog crate. That's absurd. Why would you keep a child in a dog cage? Police say the parents also padlocked the child in a bathroom, beat her repeatedly, and chained her like a slave. She escaped and made her way to a neighbor who spoke to our ABC station WPVI. She definitely had uh scars on her wrist from I think being chained up. That neighbor hadn't seen the victim in 11 years. Tonight, the young woman's mother, Brenda Spencer, and her stepfather, Brandon Mosley, facing kidnapping charges. Mosley also facing charges for allegedly sexually abusing the young woman. To me, this is the most abhorrent, heinous crime anyone could commit. David, police say the nightmare began when the young lady was removed from school and only the sixth grade. Another 13-year-old child was also living in the home. David Pier Thomas live in Washington. Pierre, thank you. Now to President Trump tonight. The first American president to visit the United Arab Emirates in nearly 30 years. the news he made there and what the president is also saying tonight about Vladimir Putin not showing up for talks on Ukraine as Republicans in Washington now sound off on this gift of a $400 million jet that the president wants to use as Air Force One. Mary Bruce traveling with the president. President Trump today welcomed with great fanfare to the United Arab Emirates. The third and final stop of a Middle East tour designed to boost business ties with wealthy Arab states where his own family has major financial interests. It is so beautiful. Very proud of my friends. Trump and the president of the UAE announcing a new artificial intelligence partnership, including a planned data center powered in part by Americanmade chips. We are going to be your friend and we're going to be your partner. Earlier, Trump visiting the largest US military outpost in the Middle East, a key hub in Qatar, strategically located to help counter Iran. The president saying his administration is now close to a nuclear deal with Iran. Iran has sort of agreed to the terms. Trump also touting efforts to end the war in Ukraine after urging Ukrainian President Zilinski and Russian President Putin to meet in Turkey tomorrow. Zilinski agreed, but Putin refused. Both countries instead sending representatives. Trump now throwing cold water on any potential progress. Nothing's going to happen until Putin and I get together. Okay. Cutter, like all the countries Trump is visiting on this tour, has business ties with the Trump Organization, now run by the president's sons. Eric Trump last month, inking plans for an exclusive Trump Golf Resort. Hanging over the president's trip to the Middle East, his eagerness to accept a $400 million luxury jet as a gift from the cuttery royal family. The plane would serve as Air Force One before its transfer to Trump's presidential library. But tonight, even some of the president's close allies are raising objections. Qar, you know, supports Hamas. Okay. Actually, the Hamas leaders live in Qar. I trust Qatar like I like I trust a rest stop. Now, this deal is still not done, but the president is facing increasing political pressure back home. Even some top members of his own party are pushing back, saying this deal needs to be closely scrutinized, raising security and legal concerns. David, Mary Bruce reporting from the Middle East all week. Mary, thank you. We turn now to a historic battle at the Supreme Court tonight. The justices hearing arguments over President Trump's executive order that would end birthright citizenship and the lower court judges who have so far blocked the order. Here's Rachel Scott. Birthright. That's a big one. Tonight, the Supreme Court grappling with one of President Trump's most controversial moves. His day one executive order revoking the right to citizenship for every baby born in the United States. Just absolutely ridiculous. But, you know, we'll see. We think it we have very good grounds. Federal judges in three states have ruled the ban on birthright citizenship violates the Constitution's 14th amendment, issuing nationwide injunctions, blocking it from going into effect. The administration today arguing those nationwide injunctions are judicial overreach. We have the government racing from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, having to sort of clear the table in order to implement a new policy. Justice Samuel Leo sounding sympathetic. And the practical problem is that there are 680 district court judges and they are dedicated and they are scholarly and I'm not impuging uh their motives in any way, but you know sometimes they're wrong. But Justice Elena Kagan says the ban on birthright citizenship is different because all the courts seem to agree the ban is unconstitutional. This case is very different from a lot of our nationwide injunction cases in which u many of us have expressed frustration um at the way district courts are doing their business. Under questioning from Justice Brett Kavanaaugh, the lawyer for the Justice Department conceding the administration has not fully determined how the ban would work on the day after it goes into effect. It's just a very practical question how this going to work. What do hospitals do with a newborn? What do states do with a newborn? I don't think they do anything different. What the executive order says in section two is that federal officials do not accept documents that have the wrong designation of citizenship from people who are subject to the executive order. How are they going to know that? The states can continue to uh the federal officials will have to figure that out. And Justice Sonia Sotomayor noting the high court has repeatedly reaffirmed the right to citizenship for every child born in this country. So, as far as I see it, this order violates four Supreme Court precedents. The majority of the justices on the bench appear skeptical of the president's executive order ending birthright citizenship, but conflicted on that central question of whether federal judges could issue those nationwide injunctions to block it, David. All right, Rachel Scott tonight. Rachel, thanks as always to the economy and the prices you pay. Tonight, Walmart warning customers that President Trump's moves on tariffs are forcing the company to raise some of its prices. The CEO saying, ""Even though the president raised and then reduced tariffs on China for now, the impact will be felt regardless. We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins. We're positioned to manage the cost pressure from tariffs as well or better than anyone. But even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices. Prices at Walmart are expected to go up later this month. When we come back here tonight, the news coming in. We have learned a 2-year-old boy has survived a 15story fall from a balcony. How the toddler survived this. And then look at this. Tonight, the alarming scene on a golf course. A 70-year-old golfer hit by an SUV tearing across the course. Uh we've learned more about his condition here in just a moment. Tonight, a frightening scene in Silver Spring, Maryland. The toddler has survived a 15-story fall from an apartment building. First responders believe the 2-year-old boy fell from a balcony and survived by landing on the bushes below. Authorities are now investigating the fall. Again, the boy is expected to survive this. An alarming scene on the golf course in Chicago. Police say a 70-year-old golfer was struck by an SUV racing across the Billy Caldwell Golf Course. An employee in a silver sedan chasing the SUV, stopping the driver. The suspect arrested by police. The victim remains in intensive care tonight. When we come back, remembering a famous actor who was in many Bond movies to the index. We learned today that actor Joe Don Baker has died in the original Walking Tall. He also appeared in three James Bond movies, the remake of Cape Fear along with Fletch and The Natural. His family tonight calling him a beacon of kindness and generosity. Joe Don Baker was 89. When we come back here tonight, the school year nearing an end and the children tonight determined that we celebrate the quiet heroes, too. ABC World News Tonight with David Mure, sponsored by Chewy. Finally tonight here, America strong with the school year ending. From the custodians to the bus drivers, the school children who say they got us here, too. At Canons Elementary School in Spartanberg, South Carolina, they are cheering for their beloved custodian, Mr. Panzel Fernandez. Mr. Fernandez started working at the school back in 1987, nearly 40 years ago. So for his 80th birthday, the students, the teachers, they all wanted to celebrate him, lining the elementary school hallways and surprising him, singing happy birthday to Mr. Fernandez.

The emergency playing out right now in parts of the east and the mid-Atlantic. A flash flood emergency unfolding as we come on the air. Cars floating away outside an elementary school. The children inside the school had to be rescued. Evacuations underway at this hour. Millions of Americans on alert right now as this storm moves up the east coast into the northeast tonight. Ginger Z standing by with the forecast. Inside the hearing tonight, Lyall and Eric Mendez after more than 35 years behind bars. The brothers making their case to be re-sentenced. Also breaking tonight, the star witness taking the stand in the Shawn Combmes trial. His ex-girlfriend breaking down while testifying. She says Combmes hiring others and what the girlfriend alleges she was expected to do. Aaron Gurski was in the courtroom. Overseas tonight, President Trump getting the royal treatment in Saudi Arabia. Fighter jets escorting Air Force One. The crown prince rolling out the lavender carpet. The president praising Saudi investments in the US amid questions tonight about the Trump family working right now on business interests of their own in the same countries the president is now visiting. Trump Tower Jedi and President Trump saying today, ""Oh, what I do for the crown prince."" Mary Bruce traveling with the president tonight. Kim Kardashian's chilling testimony describing the night she was bound, gagged, and robbed at gunpoint by masked men. The images coming in here. Firefighters still on the scene right now. The major fire burning, forcing evacuations. And the new concern now as we come on tonight. This evening, the late Pete Rose reinstated. Major League Baseball's historic decision now. And what this now means. And tonight, Robin Roberts is here. You'll meet her siblings, what they've now done to honor their mother, what she always said about the children. It might leave you singing, too. From ABC News World Headquarters in New York, this is World News Tonight with David Mure. Good evening and we begin tonight with breaking news. The evacuations at this hour, the emergency unfolding right now. A flash flood emergency in parts of the East and the Mid-Atlantic. Take a look. Heavy rain up to 2 in an hour sending rushing water through Alageney County. This is western Maryland right here. Video from an elementary school in westernport, Maryland showing cars and a dumpster being lifted up by the rushing waters floating away. Children inside the school had to be rescued late today. Chief meteorologist Ginger Z with the forecast and the images coming in right now as this system now pushes up the east coast and into the northeast. Ginger leading us off tonight. A flash flood emergency rapidly unfolding in the Mid-Atlantic. Slowmoving storms dumping up to 2 in of rain per hour in parts of Maryland. Southwest of Cumberland, this video from Westernport Elementary School shows cars, even a dumpster bobbing in the water. Students inside had to be rescued. The same system flooding parts of Florida Monday, spawning this massive water spout on a lake near Orlando. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, hot shot crews from as far away as Montana, Utah, and Tennessee coming in to help fight multiple major wildfires. North of Duth, the Camp House fire burning more than 18 square miles. Zero containment and we've lost about 40 plus uh structures, homes, and cabins. Michaela Schap, one of many forced to flee and now wait. We put every nail in that house. We painted every wall. We did it from the ground up and just to know it might be gone is so scary. Not far from there, chopper pilot Earl Waters shooting this video of his water drops over the Jenkins Creek fire. It broke out Monday, exploding to more than 10 square miles. Minnesota Governor Tim Walls calling up the National Guard to help. Country of real extremes tonight, Ginger. Back to this flash flood emergency playing out as we're on tonight. This system still at work. Yes, two to five inches, David, has already fallen in parts of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia or in the PTOAC Highlands of West Virginia. And so that's why you see that flood warning kind of clustered there. But flood watches all the way down still to Newborn, Newburn, North Carolina. This system is going to twist up the east coast as we head through tonight. We kind of forecast it here for central New Jersey heaviest back to parts of Pennsylvania at 7 a.m. tomorrow. We time it out through the afternoon. New York City gets it and then we will be drying out much more scattered in nature on Thursday. Total opposite end of the spectrum is back in the northern plains. International Falls, Minnesota was 96 on Sunday. Their hottest May temperature on record. Combine that with relative humidity as low as 15% gusts up to 50. Big- time heat. And speaking of hottest May temps, you could do it tomorrow, David. Austin and San Antonio. Yeah, we're dealing with fire danger very early in the season. Ginger Z leading us off tonight. Ginger, thank you. We turn now to the Menendez brothers and after more than 35 years behind bars, they're now making their case to be re-sentenced, to be freed. what played out at today's hearing. Matt Guppin was in court in Los Angeles. Tonight, a bombshell decision in the case of the Menendez brothers. The judge re-sentencing the brothers to 50 years to life for the shotgun murders of their parents 35 years ago. That move vacating their sentence of life without the possibility of parole and makes them eligible for parole. But it's a process that could take months or even years. He sentenced them to 50 to life, which means they're immediately eligible. All bets are still on. Uh the re-sentencing has happened. The judge's ruling coming immediately after the brothers, connected by video link from prison, read statements taking full responsibility for the murders, their lies after the murders, the pain they've caused their family, and calling the crimes an atrocious act for which they feel permanent shame. Menendez family members and even visitors weeping in court, dabbing their faces with tissues as the brothers read those statements. Earlier the family making their case to the judge. Cousin Anna Maria Barrell testifying they are universally forgiven by our family. You have brought hope to this family that we didn't seek. And so David, there are now two pathways for a possible release for the brothers. The first is parole for which they became eligible today. The second is clemency and that rests with Governor Gavin Newsome and the brothers have a hearing for that on June 13th. David, Matt Gupman live in Los Angeles tonight. Matt, thank you. We turn next tonight to the explosive testimony in the Shawn Combmes trial. The star witness testifying his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura seen this morning on her way to court. Tonight here, her emotional testimony saying Shawn Combmes hired others for drugfueled encounters and that she feared he would be violent if she refused. Prosecutors say this video from 2016 shows his ex-girlfriend trying to escape one of those encounters. Combmes knocking her to the floor and kicking her. ABC's chief investigative correspondent Aaron Kurski was in the courtroom today in a warning tonight some of the testimony is difficult in a day of graphic and emotional testimony the star witness Cassie Ventura telling the jury how her relationship with Sha Colmes quickly became a blur of jealousy violence and degrading unwanted sex sobbing on the witness stand as she described marathon drugfueled sex performances with male prostitutes um falling just the nervousness she said I think I was 22 at the time. Ventura was a young singer and model. Colmes was pushing 40 and had signed her to a long-term deal with Bad Boy Records. Ventura said Colmes proposed this sexual encounter that he called voyerism where he would watch her having sex with other men. She took drugs. She said Coli beforehand. I couldn't imagine doing all of that without some sort of buffer or a way not to feel it. Sex with a stranger I didn't want to be having sex with. Soon she said these so-called freakoffs happen weekly. Combmes demanding them so often it stifled her music career and became her full-time job. They lasted two, three, sometimes four days. Pretty quickly over time, I knew it wasn't something I wanted to be doing, especially how frequently, but I was in love and wanting to make him happy. She claimed she felt pressured to participate. I didn't feel like I had much of a choice, and if she refused, she said Colmes would be violent with me. Her voice softer when she described things too graphic for broadcast. She recalled encounters at nearly every one of Colmes's homes and at hotels across the country and overseas. Many of the sessions photographed and filmed, federal agents seizing phones and computers containing videos from the music mogul's estates. Ventura called them blackmail materials that Colbmes held over her head. During trial, prosecutors said this video shows Ventura trying to escape one of the encounters. Comb seen chasing her down a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016, knocking her to the floor and stomping on her. Ventura telling the jury he would bash my head, knock me over, drag me, kick me, stomp me in the head when I was down. When the prosecutor asked, ""How frequently was Shawn physical with you during your relationship?"" Ventura responded, ""Too frequently."" His attorneys acknowledge, David, that Commes and his ex had a toxic, violent relationship, but they say that's not the same thing as sex trafficking or racketeering, which Comolmes denies. The defense called Cassie a capable, strong adult woman who made a free choice. And David, she'll be right back here on the witness stand tomorrow. Aaron Gerski live here in New York tonight. Aaron, thank you. Next tonight to President Trump in Saudi Arabia getting a royal welcome there. The crown prince rolling out the lavender carpet. The president praising Saudi investments in the US, but there are questions tonight about the Trump family working right now on business interests of their own in the same countries President Trump is now visiting. Mary Bruce traveling with the president. She's in Riad tonight. Tonight, Saudi Arabia with a lavish welcome for President Trump. Fighter jets escorting Air Force One into Riad. The Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman rolling out the lavender carpet. It's an honor to you, my friend. We've had a tremendous relationship over the years. Joining Trump, leaders of some of the world's most powerful companies from IBM to Google and Elon Musk. The president touting $600 billion in Saudi investments in the US. So exciting. So exciting. Muhammad, do you sleep at night? How do you sleep? Huh? Just thinking. Critics doubted that it was possible what you've done. But over the past eight years, Saudi Arabia has proved the critics totally wrong. Hanging over the trip, serious questions about Trump's own business interests. His sons, who now run the Trump Organization, have projects in the works in all three countries the president is visiting. Trump Tower Jedi coming soon. Today, Trump announcing that at the Saudi Crown Prince's request, he will lift US sanctions on Syria. Now that the Assad regime has crumbled and a new government is in place, I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness. The president then saying, ""Oh, what I do for the Crown Prince. Oh, what I do for the Crown Prince. Trump also extending an olive branch to Iran. I have never believed in having permanent enemies, appearing to lay out a foreign policy approach based on whether you can make a deal regardless of past history. From embracing the Saudi crown prince years after US intelligence concluded he orchestrated the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Kosigible to forging ties with Russia's Vladimir Putin. Far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use US policy to dispense justice for their sins. Now tomorrow, the president heads to Qatar where the royal family has offered to gift him a $400 million luxury jet to be used as Air Force One before being transferred to his presidential library. Tonight, Democrats and even some members of the president's own party are raising serious questions about conflicts of interest and whether such a gift would be safe or legal. David Mary Bruce at Saudi Arabia for us. Mary, thank you. Now to the stunning reversal tonight from Major League Baseball, reinstating the late Pete Rose after being kicked out for betting on games, including his own team. What he once told our Charlie Gibson and what this now means when it comes to the Hall of Fame. Here's Will Reev. He was banned from the game for life. But tonight, in an historic decision, Major League Baseball reinstating all-time hits leader Pete Rose. Rose, who died last year, was barred from the sport in 1989 after an investigation found that he had bet on games as the manager of the Cincinnati Reds. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred saying, ""Obviously, a person no longer with us cannot represent a threat to the integrity of the game."" The former Rookie of the Year MVP and three-time World Series champion denied the allegations for years before opening up to ABC's Charlie Gibson. Did you bet on baseball? Yes, I did. And u that was my mistake not coming clean a lot earlier. The scandal has kept him from being inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame. Today's move now makes him eligible for election. The Hall of Fame saying in a statement, ""The decision to remove deceased individuals from the permanently ineligible list will allow for the Hall of Fame candidacy of such individuals to now be considered."" Fans of the Reds celebrating the news. He built the Reds. This is this is his ballpark. Now, David, this ruling doesn't just put Rose into the Hall of Fame. He would still need to get approval from a baseball committee, and the earliest he could enter the hall would be in 2028. David, really major development tonight. Will Reeve, Will, thank you. Tonight, the Trump administration has reversed the firing of more than 100 federal workers at an agency that had served West Virginia coal miners, helping to protect them from black lung disease. It comes after political pressure and a series of ABC News reports. Correspondent Jay O'Brien met with miners after the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health was virtually wiped out. They taking away the people that were watching over us, taking care of they taking their jobs. We got nobody. That's it. Even after they got those initial layoff notices, those former federal workers fought to save the agency. And tonight, many of them tell us they've been called back to work to now help those coal miners again. To the economy tonight, inflation falling to a 4-year low. Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April, year-over-year. Still rising, but better than expected. Economists say the effects of the president's new tariffs still not fully factored in. When we come back tonight, the stunning testimony here. Kim Kardashian taking the stand describing the night she was bound, gagged, and robbed at gunpoint by masked men. Also, the American college student on a senior class trip and the deadly fall from a balcony. And tonight, the images coming in here. This is here in the east. The massive fire forcing evacuations. Firefighters still on the scene. And there's a new concern at this hour. We'll have more on this in a moment. Tonight in Baltimore, a massive warehouse fire leading to evacuations and disrupting Amtrak and commuter train service. The seven alarm fire beginning to burn overnight. Firefighters are still on the scene. They say it's still burning. Dozens have been evacuated. Authorities are now concerned tonight the warehouse could collapse right onto the train tracks. Tonight, Kim Kardashian's chilling testimony about being bound, gagged, and held at gunpoint when masked men burst into her hotel room in Paris. Kardashian in Paris today facing the suspects in court. They're accused of stealing more than $6 million in jewelry during the heist in 2016. She told the court today she absolutely thought she was going to die. When we come back tonight, the American college student on a senior trip and the deadly fall from a balcony. And Robin Roberts is here tonight. You're going to meet her siblings right here and what they've done in honor of their mother. She'd be singing about this. To the index of other news tonight, authorities say an American college student was killed after a deadly fall from a resort balcony on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. The student from Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts. Police say he was on a senior class trip when it appears he accidentally fell with roommates nearby. Well, tonight it's official and it's a huge blow for the Boston Celtics. Star forward Jason Tatum is out of the playoffs. He ruptured his right Achilles tendon during last night's loss to the Knicks. The Knicks now lead the Celtics 3 to one in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. That's a big loss. When we come back here tonight, Robin Roberts is here. You'll meet her siblings, what they've done tonight, a way to honor their mother, and what she always said about children. Finally tonight here, America Strong. Our Robin Roberts right here with two of her siblings and the new children's book honoring their mother. She'd be singing about this. Oh my goodness. A new children's book is out based on my dear mother's childhood and her love for music. We grew up with music in our household. You brought me through. Every time mom came home, whatever mood she was in, happy, sad, or whatever, she'd sit at that piano and she would just play and sing. Lucy Sings on Lucy Street tells a story of resilience and hope, an idea my siblings brought to life. Written by Lawrence Roberts and Sally Anne Roberts. Oh, look at mama. Look at her. Lawrence, who we call Butch, and Sally Anne, compiling stories our mother, Lucy Marian, shared about her life as a young girl in Akran, Ohio. Mom shared a story with me. They were having their meager meal in the basement. And mom pipes up and says, ""I have a little song in my heart and I'm going to sing it."" And her father says, ""Not at this table, Lucy Mary. We don't sing at the table."" So, she dutifully ate her food as quickly as she could. And then she asked to be excused and she ran up the basement stairs and she sang this little light of mine. I'm going to let it shine. And it brightened everyone in the room and it changed her life. In the book, 8-year-old Lucy uses music as a way to uplift during tough times. Music's a universal language and that's the one thing that uh that mom was able to do is to bring that spirit out. The picture book set in 1932 during the Great Depression also shares realities our mother faced growing up. Mama is a young girl. She sees her neighbors and they innocently say to her, ""Can you wash the color?"" Cuz they had not seen someone who looked like Mama. And Mama laughs it off and says, ""Can you wash off the freckles?"" Yes. She also found a way to build bridges with people. Yeah. Mama always believing in fostering children's strengths. I've never heard say, ""Oh, that that's not a bad idea. I don't think you ought to do that."" Never heard that. Always heard encouragement. Every child has a gift. Your gift may not be singing. But whatever your gift is, as mom said, discover your gift and share it. Share it. Lucy sings on Lucy Street. We love that family. Good night.

The Diamond says the judge was telling the agents they needed a warrant to put Floriz Ruiz into custody. According to court documents, the judge told Flores Louise that his attorney uh to use that exit from the courtroom. It's usually not open to the public. Uh mostly used by the jurors.

When River was in my stomach for the past for my the last trimester, he kicked me in the ribs 3 months straight. And I couldn't sleep. But I was like, when he was born, I was like, ""Wow, it's finally over. I don't get kicked in my ribs when I'm sleeping."" But it's not over because he still kicks me in the ribs.

kaPgGH5HC0w,88614,4880,199,a week in my life vlog,20250523,"Good morning, guys. Happy Monday. Today's the first day of my day in the week vlog, and I thought, you know what? No, I'm not doing an intro. I think intros can be kind of annoying. So, we're just starting the video. No intro needed. I'm walking. Well, I'm out of breath. Today, I'm starting out the day walking to meet my friend for coffee. Actually, a lot of you guys know her. It's my friend Liz. She's one of my really good friends here. And we haven't like had a coffee date in a really long time. We've both just been really busy. So, we like scheduled this in advance. So, we're going to meet at our favorite place. It's the Brandy Cafe. Hey guys, Liz and I just got our coffee. Guys, so two things changed. I went lighter with my hair and Liz went darker. We're back, guys. So, this is what we did in the coffee shop. Liz had a great idea. My coffee was so sweet, they put way too much vanilla in it. She hadn't ordered hers yet. She was like, ""Okay, I'm going to get a regular coffee with no sweetener."" And then we're going to mix them together. It was like an experiment. It was really smart. The trick is to not, which I saw TikTok on this, but not to pour the ice out. Like, you have to drain it in separate cups. in separate cups and then mix them. And then we fixed the problem. So now we have good coffees that aren't too sweet. That was the salulu. Okay, guys. I'm back in my apartment. I had so much fun with Liz this morning. We just had a cute little girls morning. Honestly, it's like such a nice Monday morning. I don't usually like do that. So, I've been home for a couple hours just working on my laptop. I'm about to go print out some things for Oilia with our summer launch coming on Thursday. So, I need to go there. But first, I want to make a smoothie because I am getting a little hungry. You guys know my smoothie recipe by now is pretty much the same. I was at lunch with my managers recently and they were talking about how much collagen changed their life and they really educated me and inspired me to start taking it. So, that is the one addition to my smoothie that I've been doing recently. I got the ones from Vital Proteins, and it is so good and I can't notice a difference. So, for me, it works. Anyways, I do need to quickly go print those things for the Oilia cards that we're going to be putting in our summer orders. So, I'm going to try to drink this quick, grab my stuff, and then walk cuz I think it's like a 25-minute walk from me. Hi pookies. I'm back. Wow. Should I start calling you guys that? I went and I got the prints for my Oilia drop on Sunday. on Sunday. It's on Thursday. I got at least the tester prints for now. Wanted to get specific cards for our summer collection because I just thought it'd be really fun to switch it up since these are our summer pieces and I want to put one of these in every order. So, this is how they came out. We took this photo and I took this on my iPhone. Actually, I loved it. The second I took this photo at the beach, I knew that this was going to be the photo of all of the ones we took in our shoot. So, I ended up getting a few for now. On the back, it has a little note with a discount code that I'm not going to show because it's if you order. Sorry, I'm gatekeeping. I did that. And then on my way back, I decided to stop at the grocery store because I have no food. Like, I'm not even being dramatic. I think I have a bag of chocolate chips. That's about it. I'm going to do a little haul of what I got because I love grocery hauls because I like just getting inspo for meals. You guys know it's kind of hard for me sometimes to think of meal ideas. So, I'm just going to show you a few of the things that I got. First things first, my priorities. Strawberry lemonade. This is so good. And banana chips, which I already started eating. I want to make chicken stir fry tonight. So, I got some bell peppers for that. Obviously, I got chicken. I also got some broccoli for that. Other things include bread, oats, because I want to make overnight oats. I was literally in Trader Joe's looking up breakfast ideas because when I find a breakfast I like, I will eat that every day for probably about 3 months until I'm sick of it and then I move on and I discard it. The current breakfast has been yogurt with berries, which is good. It's been too long. You know, this is a cyclical thing. The cycle is done with my yogurt. I've developed an aversion to it now because I've had it so much. And I need to find my next breakfast. I hope that I like this. I'm sure I will. I used to eat these often. Overnight oats with some berries and nuts. I got chia seeds for that, too. And some granola because I thought maybe I put granola on top. I also got these sunflower seed butter cups. They're really good. Probably going to have one now. I actually like the peanut butter ones better. Don't get these. Okay, well, fail. I got more peanut butter cuz I ran out. And some fries. And lastly, stir fry sauce for my stir fry that I'm going to make for dinner tonight. That's my little haul. Um I actually I actually don't know what to do. Um I'm going to call my mom. So, I did make my dinner. I made a chicken fajita rice bowl. I don't know if that's technically what this is, but I've been making taco bowls and I'm kind of getting sick of them. So, I decided to make chicken instead with some pepper and onions. And then I just threw in some broccoli and rice and teriyak sauce, which I want more of. We all know I'm not the best chef. I'm not even a chef. I'm just trying to survive. You know, cooking is new to me. I really didn't cook in college at all. Postgrad. Now, I still didn't cook last year. I had no kitchen. So, this is like my first time cooking consistently and I'm learning. You know, I think my biggest weakness is that I take forever. Like, this took me an hour. It will probably take most people 20 minutes. So, that does frustrate me. I have to figure out something because I could not be spending this much time. I made leftovers for tomorrow. I'm going to eat this and then watch the game. I'm a really big Timberwolves fan. Honestly, my perfect night. Good morning, guys. It's the next day. I'm kind of in like a sad mood. I'm one of those people who the weather really affects my mood. And today is extremely gloomy and rainy, especially on days like this. I need to get out of my apartment and like force myself out because it just like makes me mentally feel a little better. I was going to go to Central Park today with some friends, but that is obviously not happening anymore. So, instead, I'm going to go to a cute coffee shop, which I know I always go to. I feel like that's just appropriate for a rainy day, is to go to a coffee shop. Also, to make me feel better, I want to get dressed and ready and put on a cute little outfit. I have a few options of things. The one thing I know for certain is I'm going to be wearing this bag and I'm going to kind of revolve my outfit around this because I love it and I just got it. And Coach is actually sponsoring this video. So, thank you so much to them. That is actually a dream for me. I have them on my vision board, guys. I put them on there as a goal of a brand to work with. It came true, guys. This is your sign to really make your vision board. Let me show you. This is my vision board. And there is Coach. You guys already know I love Coach. This is the Coach Terry bag. And this is such a beautiful bag because I like how the Coach logo is so subtle. And I also really like the silver hardware. I've been really into silver recently. And I also like this one specifically because it is so neutral. It just like would go with any outfit. Let me try them on and see what we like. For pants, I'm thinking these low-waisted flared black pants. Okay, here is the look so far. I don't know what I think about this. I like it. I want to try this coat and see what we think. Okay, this is the second option. I don't know what I think, but I feel like I can do a little better. All right, guys. outfit is complete. I ended up sticking with mixing black and brown. I added some silver jewelry today. Also, I wanted to keep it consistent with my bag that has silver hardware. You guys know my favorite boots of all time are these. I love how this look came together. And my Coach bag goes so perfectly with it. I do like with Coach that I can either dress up my outfit or dress it down with the bag. Heat. Heat. Good morning, guys. You may be wondering what is the occasion for the matcha and the flowers. I'm getting my friend matcha and flowers for her birthday. So, I woke up this morning. I was texting her roommate cuz I need to drop it off hopefully before she wakes up after I dropped off her little birthday surprise. I had a lot of work to do because Oilia launched our summer collection on this day. We were launching at 11:00 a.m. and I think I'm filming this around 9:00. I just had a few finishing touches and things I needed to do on the website and it was really successful. As I'm talking to you guys right now, we sold out of almost everything. I think we're planning on a restock right around when this video goes up. Thank you guys if you have supported Oilia. It means the world to me. But after it launched, I took the train to go to a meeting I had planned with my managers. Okay, guys, little update. So, I finished working at the coffee shop and my summer collection just went live for Ailia. It's doing really well. I'm not really the best with web site stuff and my assistant's out of town, so I was a little worried about it, but it ended up going live really smoothly. And now I'm on my way to a little meeting with my manager. I just took the subway. I'm running a little late, so feel a little bad about that. We're getting lunch at this Italian restaurant called Laora Bianca, which I don't think I've been to before. Wow, my heels are so loud. They're very loud. Oh my gosh, guys. I am so cars sick right now. I had my little lunch meeting with my managers and then I Ubered to Brooklyn, which was like a 20-minute Uber because I have an event with Drunk Elephant, which I'm really excited. It's kind of like a they call it, I think, a master class. The Ubers here are like so jerky and it makes me feel sick every single time. And this time was especially bad. So before I go in, I'm like standing outside because I need to recover and help my nausea to go away. I hate being cars sick. Like I do feel like I'm going to be ill all day. Of course you can use your finger. update. My skin is glowing. That was so fun. I've never done like a master class like that with the brand. I've seen so many brands put on little events like that and I've always wanted to go. Sorry guys. I feel like I've been vlogging poorly today, which we all knew one of these days would have that. It just seems to always be that way. I've just been running around like all day. So, I'm in the Uber to my friend's birthday. The same friend that I dropped off the coffee and flowers for this morning. She's having like a little birthday dinner lunch. Uh, is there anything else I have to say? No, I think that's it. Okay, bye. To you. Good morning. I just woke up. Why would I even say that? Like, I clearly just woke up. Like, I don't need to say that. You guys can tell. I have to post a video. which posts two videos and then I have to submit a third video to a brand and I'm pretty behind on my editing. So, I'm basically just going to be at my computer all day long. Big thing for me though on days like this when I'm just going to be on my computer for so much of it is that I just need to get out of my apartment. It's like the social stimulation even if I'm not speaking to people though cuz obviously I'm working majority of the time on my laptop. But just like being around people for me like mentally is so important. And I've been like this since I was like 17. I remember editing videos or just doing school work and homework. And I'd always prefer to like leave my house and do it somewhere else. Obviously not all the time, but especially on long days like this. It just helps to like break up my day. Being around people like makes me feel less alone, I guess, especially because I live alone and I like work alone. As much as I love to be alone and we talk about that on here a lot, I do think it's important for me to just get out and socialize and just like be around people and like coexist with other people. So, let's get ready. And it's 7:00 a.m., so we're getting an early start. I just realized I never made my overnight oats. I actually forgot about them. I have no words. Like, I can't believe I did that. I was hyping them up for you guys. I do make the best avocado toast, though. My friends would say the same. I've made avocado toast for two of my friends, and they loved it. I've really perfected my recipe. It's obviously not that hard, but I'm very proud of it. It's like the one thing I can make. I'm with Nikki. Say hi. Introduce yourself. Hi, I'm Nikki. We're having an editing date, working together because we both need to edit like all the time. I've been here since like literally 8:00 a.m. and we're just working together. Oh my god, I get to see the behind the scenes. Yeah, I love it. Oh my god, my neighbor below me is so loud. I can always hear his conversations in detail. I can hear everything he's talking about. I feel like things I shouldn't know. I have been home for the past 5 hours since I left the coffee shop. I've just been in my bed laying editing my vlog and I just posted it. So, I feel really good about that. But, I literally had nothing to vlog because I was sitting in silence for 5 hours. Right now, I'm going to be packing orders for Oilia, my jewelry brand. I think I talked about this earlier in the week, but we launched our summer collection. And I want to pack some of the orders. We do everything out of my apartment, which is kind of crazy, but I wanted to do things like fully myself to learn all aspects of the business from the little things to the big things. So, I'm going to pack some of the orders from our summer collection that just launched. And I love it. And I think it sold out or some of the pieces sold out already and it just launched. So, that's crazy. I love you guys. I think we're going to be restocking hopefully next week. This is the setup we have right now. I laid everything out really aesthetically just for a photo for the Instagram, but I'm going to start packing. Okay, guys. Roughly an hour and a half later, I finished the orders for today. They're right here all wrapped and ready to go to be shipped out tomorrow. I am I don't know what I'm going to do. Probably go to bed soon. So, that took actually longer than I thought. I always underestimate the time on everything and I need to get better at that. So, good night. Good morning, guys. It's a good day because I remembered finally to make my overnight oats last night. I literally got into bed, was about to go to sleep, and then I remembered suddenly that I needed to make my overnight oats. So, it's really easy. It's basically same parts, oats and milk, and then some peanut butter and honey. And then I just threw in some strawberries and granola on top. Oh, there's also chia seeds in here. Um, I'm going to eat this in peace and enjoy the sun because the sun is out. I'm going to get ready and then we'll figure out the day. Okay, guys. I got dressed. By the way, breakfast was so good. That's my new hyperfixation breakfast. I got this outfit shopping at the vintage shop by my apartment last week and I love it. I am leaving for Alaska next week. So random. I know people are going to be like, ""Why are you going to Alaska?"" Honestly, my dad and I just wanted to take a trip together. We've always talked about going to Alaska. The nature, it looks beautiful there, and it's supposed to be a good time of year to go. It is going to be a little chillier than I anticipated, though. So, I want to go to Brandy to grab a few warmer pieces of clothing that are so cute. I think like a crew neck or like a zip-up hoodie. I'm going to do that and then when I get back later, I think I'm going to pack. Brandy kind of sucked today. At least in my opinion, it did. I just was kind of underwhelmed. But just as I gave up hope on my way out, I saw this zip-up. It's actually pretty thick, which is kind of what influenced me to get this because I do think it will keep me warm. And then I went home and I packed. So, that was my week. in the life vlog. I hope you guys liked watching. Stay tuned for the next video. I'm so excited. It's going to be one of my favorites. And I'll see you next week. Love you guys.",0.042,0.784,0.174,0.9999

No electricity though, no water system. Now we will enter to one of the cave houses. But now it has been turned into a cafe. But first floor is always used as the kitchen was used as a living area for all the family. In winter time they were making the fire in that room or another room and they were coming together. As you know limestone keeps warm in winter keeps cool in summer time. Originally that cave house had four floors. This is the first one and I'm going to take you to the other three. Okay, so this is the first floor. Usually they use it as a living area and kitchen. Careful bars. Okay, we are now on the second floor. Imagine they carved this all by hand.

Okay, let's [Music] go. We made a quick stop. We climbed up the hill and it's so gorgeous here. We're going back to Istanbul, but instead of hitting the road, we are flying. So flying time from Capedokia to Istanbul is around 1 hour and 30 minutes. And transfer from hotel to the airport. Soal. Look at that pa details. And this is our front view. Take out pa hotel. This is so comfy and spacious. [Music] And just like that, we're back here in Istanbul. And we have the Galata Tower at our back, guys. That's a famous tower here in Istanbul. We arrived here at around 1:00 p.m. Mini bars. Istanbul since it's our free day. Tomorrow start tour and also schedule photo shoot with Galata Tower result. pimple. Now we're heading to a certain restaurant. We're here. We got our order. This is Sebastian with chocolates. It's a cheesecake guys with Belgian chocolate on top and of course Turkish tea and si bars meron dang banana croissant something and coffee for him. Of course we are eating it in front of the Galata Tower. Now taste test day eight here in Turkey guys and we will explore Istanbul by footalam but we love it because we love walking panahon and she will be our guide for today. We're so excited to explore Istanbul. And by the way, that's a mosque. And this is Istanbul University. She's Miss D, by the [Music] way. We will now enter book bazaar. So s bookworms, this is your place. [Music] One thing about Turkey, cats, so if you are a cat lover, move Turkey. Now we've reached the Grand Bazaar, but this is like the outside part. [Music] So, Grand Bazaar is so huge and according to our guide, the best way to explore Grand Bazaar is to get lost, right? So, inside the bazaar may shop for jewelries, bags, ceramics, souvenirs, m Turkish delights and a whole lot more. Another group of cats spotted. Told you guys, if you love cats, Turkey is the best place for you. According to our guy, this cafe is like the Starbucks of Turkey. [Music] After our stroll, we went inside Haga Sophia Grand Mosque and it was the most interesting mosque I've ever been to. Our guide explained that at one point in history, it was briefly converted into a cathedral under the Roman Catholic Church. What really surprised me was they still kept the images of Jesus and Mary. It's like walking through a living piece of history. Being inside, I couldn't help but feel like I was experiencing two religions at once. It was such a powerful reminder of how different faiths can come together in harmony. Hagya Sophia isn't just a place of worship, but it's a symbol of history, faith, and unity all in one. [Music] To end the tour guide, guys. And this is also like a museum cuz bandun may artifacts like the oldest coffee pot. So if you're a coffee lover, then this is a good place to explore. And we're having konaf and I have my coffee here. This is the Turkish coffee medium roasted in fairness. And we have pomegranate tea. Sim having also pomegranate tea.

This is a very famous spot because obviously very colorful photos and all picture. This is also a famous shooting place Turkish TV shows. So at my back is a Bulgarian church and it is made of iron. This is the biggest church in the world that is made of iron before Bulgarian church. So that's why they built a new one but this time it's made of iron. Smart. We stopped by this cafe and we are having Turkish coffee and baklava. How was it? Cheers. [Music] [Applause] [Music] The Turkish term talaga is pronounced guys. So let's just call it a Turkish pancake. So basically it's like a tortilla bed Nutella or pin lagan cheese or pin potatoes or minced meat. So dependo. We ordered the Nutella and the yellow cheese. The yellow [Music] And now we're taking the bus first tour wind so and it's so chilly. The bus forest cruise for me is truly a must try activity when you visit Istanbul Turkey since Turkey is a transcontinental country which means it straddles both Europe and Asia continents. By taking this cruise, you get to witness both sides of Turkey, the European side and the Anatolian side, which is the Asia. It is such an incredible way to see the city's diverse landscape and architecture in one journey. We were also grateful to have a knowledgeable guide with us. She explained every structure and building we passed, sharing fascinating stories and insights that made the experience even more memorable. If you are in Istanbul, don't miss the chance to explore the Bos for us. It's a beautiful and unforgettable way to experience the heart of Turkeykey's rich history and vibrant culture. This is our last dinner here in Turkey, guys. We're having octopus and then [Music] fish. And just like that, our turkey trip has ended. And to be honest, I didn't have high expectations before visiting Turkey. I just wanted to see the hot air balloons in Capidokia, something I've only seen in countless photos and videos. But what I did not expect was how deeply I'd be drawn into the country's rich history and vibrant culture. Every corner, every pathway, every ancient structure seems to whisper stories of the past. Turkey is a place where history isn't just preserved. It's alive in the stones, the streets, and the people. And let's not forget about the food. Each meal was a celebration of flavors. From savory kebabs to sweet baklava, every bite is a journey that leaves you craving for more. More than just a destination, Turkey turned out to be so much more than we expected. An incredible journey through history, nature, and culture. It's a place that captures your heart in ways you've never imagined. A tapestry of stories, flavors, and memories we will cherish forever. So, if you're thinking of visiting Turkey, go with an open mind and adventurous spirit. You might just find yourself falling in love with its timeless magic, just like with it.

t4Mz5J6YXzA,14834,2419,357,The Reality of God’s Love – Daily Devotional,20250524,"[Music] Here's today's InTouch devotion. Today's scripture reading is 2 Corinthians 11:es 23- 27. Are they servants of Christ? I speak as if insane. I more so in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in danger of death. Five times I received from the Jews 39 lashes. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. A night and a day I have spent in the deep. I have been on frequent journeys in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers among false brethren. I have been in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. Is there anything that prevents you from feeling confident that God loves you? Perhaps you're convinced some sin from your past blocks his care and compassion. In that case, think about Paul. He violently persecuted Christians before he himself finally turned to the Lord. If such a man knew God loved him, would that help you realize you too are loved? Whatever experiences you're concerned about, Paul probably encountered something you can relate to. Yet he kept spreading his message of hope that God loves us and sent his son to die on the cross for our sins. Whether your situation is unfair, painful, or embarrassing, the fact that it happened doesn't mean God has stopped loving you. Sometimes we face difficulty because he is polishing our rough edges and shaping us into his image. Other times, trials instigated by Satan are allowed in our life through the Lord's permissive will. Either way, God is working everything out to our good according to his individualized purpose for each believer. Here's the key to accepting the truth of unconditional divine love. Focus on God rather than circumstances. When you're learning of him, talking with him, and sharing your life with him, trust and faith naturally replace doubt and fear.

cY30nuj9cxI,29717,0,0,"Daily Mass Wednesday, May 21, 2025",20250521,"Hello everyone and welcome to today's celebration of the mass. Just a quick note uh change that we're going to be making. We received a notice from Vimeo which is the platform that we have our mass with music on and apparently we have been exceeding our allowed bandwidth for the last six or seven months. meaning that uh it a lot of information is passed on to the viewers. That said, about uh 3/4 of a percent to one and a quarter% of our viewers are on the Vimeo platform, which right now is very expensive. In order to remedy that situation, we would have to go into their top tier, which would be absolutely prohibitive. So, the way we're going to handle this is we will have our daily mass only on YouTube without music. As you know, there are tons of copyright issues that they like to throw at us. And our Sunday mass will continue to be on the Vimeo platform with music and that should solve the problem. Again, uh we thank you for joining us and we now begin today's mass. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. Have mercy on us, O Lord, for we have sinned against you. Show us, O Lord, your mercy and grant us your salvation. May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Amen. Let us pray. Oh God, restorer and lover of innocence, direct the hearts of your servants towards yourself that those you have set free from the darkness of unbelief may never stray from the light of your truth. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever. Amen. A reading from the Acts of the Apostles. Some who had come down from Judea were instructing the brothers, ""Unless you are circumcised according to the Mosaic practice, you cannot be saved."" Because there arose no little dissension and debate by Paul and Barnabas with them, it was decided that Paul, Barnabas, and some of the others should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and prestors about this question. They were sent on their journey by the church and passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling of the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brethren. When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church as well as by the apostles and the presitters, and they reported what God had done with them. But some from the party of the Pharisees, who had become believers, stood up and said, ""It is necessary to circumcise them and direct them to observe the Mosaic law."" The apostles and the prespits met together to see about this matter. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord. Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord. I rejoiced because they said to me, ""We will go up to the house of the Lord."" And now we have set foot within your gates, O Jerusalem. Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord. Jerusalem built as a city with compact unity. To it the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord. Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord according to the decree for Israel to give thanks to the name of the Lord. In it are set up judgment seats, seats for the house of David. Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord. Spirit of God. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to John. Glory to you, O Lord. Jesus said to his disciples, I am the true vine and my father is the vine grower. He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit and everyone that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit. You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you. Remain in me as I remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit because without me you can do nothing. Anyone who does not remain in me will be thrown out like a branch and wither. People will gather them and throw them into a fire and they will be burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you. By this is my father glorified that you bear much fruit and become my disciples. The gospel of the Lord. Praise to you Lord Jesus Christ. In today's gospel reading, Jesus describes himself and his followers using the metaphor of the vine and its branches. He speaks about pruning away the branches that do not bear fruit. This pruning can symbolize many things as there are various aspects of our lives that we need to trim back. We need to eliminate those things that hinder us from following the two essential commandments to believe in and love God and to love one another as Jesus has commanded. It's important to prune away anything that prevents our faith from flourishing in our lives and souls. Each of us has different areas that require pruning. This might include our pride, selfishness, materialistic desires, negative thoughts, or unhealthy relationships. And we can be certain that by our very human nature, we must remove perceptions, prejudices, judgments, and attitudes that obstruct our faith from bearing fruit. So, let us take some time in prayer to reflect on what prevents us from adhering to these two fundamental commandments. Together, let us commit to pruning those distractions from our lives. And now we pray to God the Father who raised Jesus, our savior, from death, that we may unite our hearts and souls to Christ, the true vine. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer that the prayer and charity of the people of the church may win back the hearts of those who have fallen astray. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer that we as branches of the vine may accept the value of suffering as the pruning of God's hands so that we may bear more fruit for his glory. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer for all seminarians of our dascese that they may be diligent in their discernment about priesthood and that we may support them by our prayers and encouragement. We pray to the Lord. Here our prayer for all those who have died and gone before us marked with the sign of faith. In a special way today we remember Peter for time we pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayer for the homebound and the sick for those who care for them and for all those intentions we now offer from the silence of our hearts. For these we pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. God our loving father. We beg you to hear the prayers we offer you this day and to answer them according to your holy will. We make them through Christ our Lord. Amen. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands. It will become for us the bread of life. Blessed be God forever. By the mystery of this water to share in the divinity of Christ. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands. It will become our spiritual drink. Blessed be God forever. Pray brothers and sisters that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the almighty father. May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his holy church. Grant we pray, O Lord, that we may always find delight in these pascal mysteries, so that the renewal constantly at work within us may be the cause of our unending joy. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit, lift up your hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is right and just. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation at all times to acclaim you, oh Lord, but in this time above all to lod you yet more gloriously when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. For with the old order destroyed, a universe cast down is renewed, and integrity of life is restored to us in Christ. Therefore, overcome with pascal joy, every land, every people exalts in your praise, and even the heavenly powers with the angelic hosts sing together the unending hym of your glory as they acclaim, ""Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosana in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosana in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, the f of all holiness. Make holy, therefore, these gifts we pray by sending down your spirit upon them like the dwfall so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving thanks, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, ""Take this all of you and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you. In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice and once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying, ""Take this all of you and drink from it. For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity. together with Leo our Pope and William our Bishop and all the clergy. Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all. We pray that with the blessed Virgin Mary, mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be co-airs to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your son Jesus Christ. Through him and with him and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen. At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our savior Jesus Christ. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, ""Peace I leave you. My peace I give you. Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will. Who live and reign forever and ever. Amen. The peace of the Lord be with you always. Be with you. Thank you. Thanks. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace. Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. For those who cannot join us in person and receive the eukarist, we now offer this act of spiritual communion. My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the most holy sacrament. I love you above all things and I desire to receive you into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace you as if you were already there and unite myself wholly to you. Never permit me to be separated from you. [Music] Amen. Let us pray. Hear, O Lord, our prayers that this most holy exchange by which you have redeemed us may bring your help in this present life and ensure for us eternal gladness through Christ our Lord. Amen. The Lord be with you and with your spirit. May almighty God bless you. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. The mass has ended. Go in peace. Thanks be to God.",0.044,0.719,0.237,1.0
IIuBK7-BYE0,19420,1335,368,QUEEN: SHEER HEART ATTACK | Full Album reaction & analysis | The Daily Doug Ep. 959,20250523,"It's the Daily Doug. Hey y'all, welcome back to the Daily Doug. Thanks for being with me today, my friends. Today is a Friday. We have made it to the end of a week and I am sharing a full album reaction that I have previously filmed with all of you today. And there's a specific reason why. You may notice I am wearing my Freddy Mercury jacket. This is a It's not the exact jacket, y'all. I would not fit into Freddy's actual actual clothes. This is sized particularly for a Doug sized human. It is a replica, but it is real leather and it is quite wonderful. And this was gifted to me by one of our patrons named Janine a few years ago. And I want to talk about Janine for a minute because sadly uh last week she passed away. And you know this happens in a community of so many people that we've assembled over the years. We uh occasionally get folks who pass and they become really close friends. Janine is someone who lived a full life and she absolutely loved Queen. In fact, uh you may see this jacket appearing in several episodes that have already been filmed. You will see them in future episodes because I intend to keep it and keep using it. But pretty much every Queen episode that we recorded and released since October of 2021 when Janine became a patron of ours. Uh each one of those episodes has been the result of her direct suggestion. And I uh I loved doing these reaction videos for her specifically because I knew how much they meant to her. She lived alone. She had a cat named Mercury, named after Freddy Mercury, and she would appear in my DMs pretty much every day, just checking in on me, making sure I was doing okay, asking me what I was up to that day, uh, uh, double-checking on that I still liked Queen, and asking when the next Queen uh, uh, episode was going to be released and all of that. And over the years, I got protective almost of her. I really didn't want anything bad to happen to her. And uh just felt a kinship with this person who opened up and shared so much of her struggles and her life with me directly. and you get to know people, you know, uh, as much as I love the musical part of this and that's what drives what I do here on this YouTube channel, it really is the people that makes it really worth continuing on and continuing to make these connections because the music is what binds us, but it needs us to bind together. you know, we need to share this love of music, this love of art, how it impacts our life. And she was one of the best. Sadly, she uh she passed away. I don't know a lot about how it actually uh happened, what what the cause of death was, but when I stopped hearing from her, it um it really worried me and I ended up just going on the internet and looking for an an obituary that I was fearful might exist and and I found it. And sadly, that's how I figured out that that she had passed. Um, when I decided to do a queen poll over on our Patreon at the end of April, it was specifically because I had heard from Janine and she had hurt her hip and she was going to be going to the doctor and I thought, you know what? We haven't done Queen in a while. Let's get one in there for Janine. And I don't know, I don't know if she ever got to see this, y'all. I really don't. But this episode was done in love for her and for all of the Queen fans in our community. And to commemorate uh not only this great band, but uh this wonderful woman and her impact on our lives, I want to share with y'all my full album reaction to Sheer Heart Attack from Queen with y'all now. Okay, y'all. It's EPL time. You could tell by the jacket, my Freddy Mercury jacket. Time for some queen, everybody. I had to include the jacket, but I'm not going to wear it for the entire uh episode because it's a little warm, y'all. And I normally get really worked up while I'm doing these. But I wanted to include the leather Freddy Mercury jacket in the video today because every time we do Queen, I got to include the jacket. So, all hell King Freddy, y'all. We got King Freddy and a band called Queen. How about that? So, let's get to it, shall we? I think I'm ready. I think I'm ready. It's one way to start a video, isn't it? So, we have an extended play lounge up today. This is episode 90, our 90th full album reaction here on Patreon. We're getting to Queen and the album today is Sheer Heart Attack. This has been one of our favorite bands uh throughout the life of the Daily Doug. And I have heard music from this band outside of the Daily Doug, y'all. They they are a big and well-known band. It's Queen. They've sold a few records, right? I mean, I looked and they are, I think, fifth all time in the number of albums sold by artists. I think they're only beaten by the Beatles and Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley and Elton John. That's it. And uh they their music is known around the world. And um they're such a unique and special special band and it's been a while since we've gotten to music by them. We've heard them on YouTube. We've heard them in EPLL episodes previously on fan favorites behind the scores. Y'all vote for Queen. Uh and uh you know they're so versatile and so unique, but it's been a while since we've heard from them. So it is time to get back to music from Queen. Thank you for voting in the poll. We are doing Sheer Heart Attack because it won the poll by a pretty convincing margin. And uh as far as albums by Queen go, I've only heard two in their entirety. We heard A Night at the Opera, their fourth album first. That was EPL number 48 back in July of 2023. And then we heard Queen 2, their second album, Aside at a Time over on YouTube. That was done in the summer of 2024. So this time, as determined by our poll, we're going to the album that comes right in the middle of Queen 2 and A Night at the Opera. It's Sheer Heart Attack, the third album by Queen. This was released in November of 1974. And with this album, they are really starting to gravitate more towards a little bit of a more conventional rock and roll, even glam rock, uh, as opposed to their more progressive roots. And this is really the album that launches the band into a mainstream popularity around the world. And uh I I've heard some of the songs on here. I'll talk about that as we go along, but uh I've never heard uh quite a few of these. We've got 13 tracks on this little album. And uh as I read in, we've got a ton of overdubbing as well. Something that Queen is quite known for, they're extravagant arrangements, right? Um, I read that on uh one song called uh Bring Back That Leroy Brown. We'll hear that on side two. They had 70 different vocal tracks and they had to mix it down so that the 24 track mixer that they were using could handle it. And even at that point in time, think about this, 1974, a 24 max, a 24 track mixer, that's what I wanted to say, is relatively luxurious for that time period. Anyway, and they were way over that and having to edit things down and edit things down. And I read that there were even time constraints as they were finishing the recording and mastering of this to get it out by the time that they wanted to. And they made it and we get this wonderful album, y'all. So, let's get to it. We got Freddy Mercury on lead and backing vocals. He's on the piano. He's on the ham and organ on some percussion as well. Brian May is on the guitars, uh, lead and backing vocals. A banjo, which is a cross between a ukulele and a banjo. That'll be fun to hear. John Deacon is on the bass. He also plays some guitar and the double bass as well. And Roger Taylor on drums and percussion, also on lead and backing vocals. So, let's start off with side one. And the first song on the album is called Bright and Rock. It's by Brian May. And both Brian and Freddy share the lead vocals on this one. This is one that I have heard back in Fan Favorites 14. Uh we were celebrating guitar month in April of 2023 for that episode. And as we remember, this is a song that's known for Brian's guitar solo more than anything else. Uh, the song includes an unaccompanied guitar solo interlude, which uses delay to build up the guitar harmonies and contrauntal melodic lines. The studio version only contains one main guitar and one echoed guitar for a short section, but live uh Brian would usually split his guitar signal into a main and to an echoed uh signal and send those out to separate banks of amplifiers. Only Brian can figure that out, right? And so one, this guitar solo is considered to be one of the great guitar solos of rock and roll. So, let's get it rolling with Bright and Rock from Queen. Here we go. Brighton Rock. Yeah, I remember. We're at the circus or the fair or something. [Music] down at the [Music] shore. And we start off this album with recorded sounds, you know, found sounds. Then it segus into the band doing their thing. Which way is [Music] Jimmy? And they're in a bright cave. What do you see? B major. Oh no, I must await to my mom in disarray. in the air. She wouldn't approve of how we spend this holiday. Rock of aes do not crumble. Love is breathing still. Our lady will shine down. A little is B. Now the five. [Music] So they transition into E [Music] minor. I'm pretty sure just to give [Music] Brian a relatively straightforward pallet to weave his magic [Music] here. There's a four. That's the minor three may do, [Music] right? It's been so long, y'all. I barely remember this. [Music] [Applause] [Music] That's an eventual E chord. I [Music] think. There's the delay. [Music] Let's take a dough. [Music] Uh, okay. We get back into what they were doing uh in the actual song. by [Music] seven and they move the music back to B for the rest of the [Music] song. And as soon as I say that, they go back to [Music] E and the song ends. What a way to start an album. I mean, come on. Uh, they start off by giving you this, okay, picture it. You're at you're in Brighton, you're down on the coast and and all this revalry is happening, you know, and uh by the time we get into that middle part, we're like, what is Brian doing? Holy crap. And off we go. And it's it's a roller coaster ride from there. I can only imagine, except I can imagine because I've heard Killer Queen before. This is the next song. It's by Freddy. It's their big breakthrough hit. It hit uh number two in the UK and it was their first top 20 hit in both the US and Canada. And about the song, Freddy said it's about a highclass call girl. And I'm trying to say that classy people uh can be [ __ ] as well. Okay. Uh that's what the song is about. Though I'd prefer people to put their interpretation upon it to read into it what they what they like. But Freddy is saying it doesn't matter who you are. Anybody can be a [ __ ] Come on. So let's get to it. This is Killer Queen from you guessed it. It's Queen. Here we go. She [Music] keeps in a pretty cabinet building. It's been so long since I've heard this cigarettes. in any extraordinarily [Music] nice dynamite with a laser beam. Dynamite with a laser beam blow guaranteed to blow your mind. [Music] Want to try? and he's all over the place harmonically. [Applause] [Music] It's nice to see some live footage here, too. Although I'm pretty sure it's the studio recording. [Music] [Music] Like different keys are implied with all of those five to one. [Music] It makes it very difficult for me to to follow what key they're actually in. [Music] T le soul soul that's a B flat of a hat to C G to C flat B flat to B flat to B flat got a half step up. It's amazing, isn't it? [Music] gunpowder gelatine dynamite with a laser beam. Who else could have written this? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] It sounds like a dominant as they kind of fade out. There you go. That uh segus, I think, directly into the next song, which is called Tenement Funster. This one's by Roger, and Roger handles the lead vocals. It's a song about uh rebelling as a younger person. And Roger says that a tenement funster is like your uh your neighborhood prankster, the person that's always getting into trouble, you know, the person who's always up for a good time as well and not afraid to break the rules. So together with the next two songs, Tenement Funster forms a three song medley that I actually have heard, though I don't think by Queen back in fan favorites uh number six all the way back in July of of 2022. We heard uh our favorite covers and y'all picked Dream Theat's cover of this medley. And it's been so long I don't really remember, friends. So, it's going to be like hearing it for the first time. So, I'm going to go song by song, but I won't spend much time in between. So, this starts off with tenement funster, and it goes like this. Here we go. This playlist from YouTube gives a little bit of extra time at the beginning of all these tracks, I believe. been amazing the people next [Music] door and my rock and roll 45 been enraging your folks on the love floor. [Music] He goes to the minor key instead of the major. [Music] I've got a way with the girls on my block. [Music] Who's going to get in trouble this time? Give me a good guitar. Nice. And you could say that my head was major four I think. Just buy me an open car. I'll make the speed of life out of this place. [Music] long. New [Music] [Music] dough by a half step. And they're back where they were for the first verse. A and E. So the same situation just cuts like at night when you're young and you crazy lands on that D. Let me get this extended D. And I thought it was five to G, but I think it's going to be flat 7 to E. Give me a good guitar. You could say that my head is disgrace. Oh, just find me over. I'll make the speed of life out of this place. And that's going to go into the next song. It really does segue, doesn't it? So, let's go on to it. This next song is called Flick of the Wrist, and it's by Freddy Mercury, and it we continue on from where we just left off. Here we go. And they and they put Yeah, they put that extra break in the sound at the beginning of those tracks. Oh, well. [Music] Okay. [Music] Dislocate your spine if you don't sign. He says I'll have you see it double. Okay. meize you when he's tight with those synchronize your mind and see the beast within him rise. Don't look back. Don't look back. It's a rip. The wrist baby a kiss your man. The wrist. He'll eat your heart out. taking the And then I'm kicking the head. Damn. All this time you've been baby you've been had. So he is talking about uh con men, con artists lie in deep [Music] trouble. He said your human pride castrate your human pride. Sacrifice your leisure days. [Music] It's a ripoff. [Music] Love the sound of the drums. All those [Music] toms like a C. C to D. [Music] Work my fingers to my bones. I scream with pain. I still make no impression. [Music] with this face, but she'll let you face the [Applause] last chorus and overtones on the vocals that they have. [Music] the wrist. He leads your heart out the riing. [Music] And that's going to fade and go right into the next song called Lily of the Valley. I don't think Freddy's really out for blood here in this one. Uh he's just, I think, working out some inner demons. Um, I I'm reminded of Death on Two Legs from Queen 2, where they were just taking a jab at that manager that they were upset at. I think here they're just talking about everyday um, conmen and ripoff artists that we come into contact with all the time. And you know, if your be if your [ __ ] meter is is working, then then you'll you'll know. You'll know. But they're saying, uh, keep watch. Keep watch. It's a ripoff. So, up next is Lily of the Valley. Another one by Freddy. And it's the last one of this little medley. Here we go. And we wait. [Music] And it segues into a minor from E, I think. [Music] I am [Music] relative. But why does everybody tell [Music] me an answer for me please? The lily of the valley. [Music] I lie and wait with open eyes. I carry on through stormy skies. I follow every my kingdom for a horse. But each time I grow into the night, relieve me for a while and cast me from your spell. Let me go. messenger from seven seas has fallen right. He's referencing his own song, right? He's a bride. [Music] And it resolves to a major chord. Are they going to end it there? They give us that really deep low C and the medley ends like that. How about that? What a sight of music we have here, y'all. We've got one more before we uh before we end the side. But uh for a for a quick second here, that's a beautiful little song, Lily of the Valley. Brian in 1999 said that this heartfelt song from Freddy was at its core about being with his girlfriend and realizing that he just needed to be somewhere else. I am forever searching high and low, but why does everybody tell me no? Neptune of the seas have answer for me please. the lily of the valley doesn't know, you know, um, uh, one of our friends at the church where I work, they've, they know that I've been emotionally struggling recently, and they're having similar issues with their own family, and they have liies of the valley, uh, the little, um, blooming, uh, flower there in their on their property. And they brought me a little a little uh vase of liies of the valley and they smelled incredible and they just told me whenever you're getting upset or really sad just smell and and be reminded of of everything that's good. And so the lily of the valley is kind of newly on my mind here. And he's saying, I've I've gone to uh nature and communed and even, you know, tried to maybe breathe in that and accept that wisdom. Even the lily of the valley doesn't know. You know, maybe the Neptune of the seas knows. Uh the messenger from the seven seas has flown to tell the king of Ry that he's lost his throne. So nobody's around to tell him. Uh the lily of the valley doesn't know. He's just wanting some sort of validation maybe that he should stay, but everything else uh it's like he's like, ""Yeah, it needs to go."" And and all of these signs are like, ""Uh, yep. Yep. We're not going to intervene."" That's that's the message that you need to have right now. If you think something else about these songs and what they mean, let me know uh in the comments. Uh, but that's what I found when I researched it and that's what popped into my head as I was thinking about it. But really, it's because I've come into contact personally very recently with some liies of the valley and they're quite uh, beautiful and breathtaking. One more song on side one before we get to side two. This one's called Now I'm Here. This one's by Freddy, but uh sorry, this one's by Brian, but Freddy sings lead. And Brian is on the piano for this one. So, let's take a look at Now I'm Here from Queen. Here we go. Here I stand. Here I stand. around. I've heard this one, too. That sounds familiar. [Music] Now I'm [Music] I'm [Music] just a human. [Music] Yeah, they raised the key to a new five. Oh, and now they're in E instead of a D. Baby, I was when you took my hand at the light of the night. The people lost didn't understand, but you knew my name on sight. Whatever came of you and me, America. [Music] They may be doing some more straight ahead rock and roll, but the progressive nature of their harmonies is still in play, y'all. It's not a three chord rock [Applause] [Music] band of your love like chase. Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain with the rain down my face. Your mind still light up the sky. Up a step, up a step. sequential pattern. Yeah. [Music] 7. They switch keys. They're back in [Music] B. You and me. I love to leave my memory with you. I love that. Maybe I haven't heard this. [Music] You know what? It reminds me of Arnold Lane from Pink Floyd a little bit in just that one little spot. Maybe that's what it was reminding me of. I don't know. [Music] Still they started the uh the side in B. So they're coming back home as we end the side. That's pretty cool. [Applause] [Music] Go little go little queeny. [Music] What a fun sight of music, [Music] y'all. It's so entertaining. And so you like I've I'll use that word. We should do a drinking game. Uh the episode or or the word for this episode is unique. I said unique. I need to take a drink today. It's just coffee, y'all. Well, side one in the books. That's amazing. Really, really great stuff. So, as we get to side two, we get to In the Lap of the Gods, which is another one that I have heard, but it's been years, friends. I heard this uh In the Lap of the Gods and In the Lap of the Gods Revisited, which ends the album. No spoilers. Uh, back in episode 225, I think I just recorded episode 951, a while ago. This was September of 2021, uh, where I heard these, and I haven't heard them since. So, it will be lovely to make their acquaintance again. We're going to start with In the Lap of the Gods. I'll get to revisit it by the time we finish the album. But for now, let's get back to In the Lap of the Gods, the first track on side two. And it goes like this. Here we [Music] go. Wake up call. [Music] Somebody pinched Roger when he was asleep but wasn't looking. That's how they got that that note. [Music] [Applause] [Music] It's like a melodrama. [Music] I live my life for you. All my thoughts with you alone. Anything you ask I do for you. I touch your lips. Touch your lips with mine. [Music] I in the end I leave it to the Lord's in the lap of the gods. What more can I do? I leave it in the god. I give it to you. Leave it in the in the [Music] I want you to go. [Music] Goes there. [Music] Finally, now it's a [Music] new Roger. [Music] Now instead of two, five, it's just one to four. Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, of [Music] the L of [Music] the It's great hearing the the guitar popping in there. [Music] That ends. I wasn't even paying attention. I guess it segus directly into the next tune. I'll get there in a second. But um friends, I don't remember that at all because it shocked me. It shocked me like I had never heard it before. Roger's vocals was absolutely incredible. I live my life for you. Think all my thoughts with you and only you. Anything you ask, I do for you. I touch your lips with mine, but in the end, I leave it to the Lord's. Leave it in the laps of the lap of the gods. What more can I do? So, the next song stole again, Stone Cold Crazy. Uh, the songwriting is credited to the entire band on this one. It was not released as a single, but it was a live concert favorite throughout the rest of the 1970s as they played live. And it's notably been covered by Metallica. Uh, I haven't heard that cover either. And it's described as thrash metal before the term was invented. Let's get to it, friends. Stone, cold, crazy from Queen. Here we go. And they're going to give us a little bit of intro. Okay. So, that drum pops into this very sunny on Saturday morning. There's a rumor going around town like a driver. Here come the law going to break down the door and carry me away once more. Never want anymore. I stole crazy. Go crazy. [Music] Awesome. Wow. uh minor third right [Music] so that makes that the major [Music] third of where they [Music] Yeah. So that's a B [Music] flat. Here [Music] comes my juice. This is great. That's it. There's got to be more. I'm I'm sure live that that was embellished a little bit, y'all. I like the the really quick uh lyrics from Freddy as well. I heard that in G minor and when it was going to the in and the main riff was just up the minor third, the G to the B flat, G to the B flat. But when it went to the four, that's the C. And then it's like between the C and the B flat, that's a whole step. And they went to the note that's between them, a B natural, which is a lovely note to connect to a G. It's just the major third above G instead of the minor third. And in the context of G minor with flats in it, that B natural is is quite um a departure, which is why it sounded so interesting there. And then they flip right back into uh G minor as they as they uh keep going. Woohoo. Okay. Stone Cold Crazy. That was fun. That was fun. Next up is a song called Dear Friends. And this is quite a short little song. It's by Brian. Uh Freddy is doing the singing and Brian is back at the piano. And as I am looking at this, there's only just one little verse. So I am quite uh eager to hear this this little tune. Dear friends from Queen. Here we go. So dear friends, your love is gone. Only tears to dwell upon. I dare not say as the wind must blow, so a love is lost. Love is one. Go to sleep and dream again. Soon your hopes arise. And then from all this gloom, life can start a new and there'll be no crying soon. [Music] It's a hymn and it's also a pallet cleanser after the first two songs especially when we get you know uh in the lap of the gods right into that stone cold crazy and then we get that little pallet cleanser. So dear friends, your love is gone. Only tears to dwell upon. I dare not say as the wind must blow, so a love is lost, a love is one. Go to sleep and dream again. Soon your hopes will rise. And then from all this gloom, life can start a new and there'll be no crying soon. It's It's wonderful. It's wonderful. I love art. It's And especially music. Yeah. You're like, ""No [ __ ] Doug."" Uh, but man, it's it's it's just amazing how a turn of phrase, some sounds can just completely turn your uh your mood, your your daily outlook, maybe that was wonderful. Wonderful. Let's keep going, friends. The next song is called Misfire and this one is by John Deacon and it's John's first credited song on a Queen album from what I could find and it's another short tune and we've got John playing the guitars on this track. So, let's uh let's take a look at Misfire from Queen. Here we go. [Music] Don't you despire to me with the desire to carry on? Don't you know honey that love's game? Cool. E minor 6 relative major G flat 6. Oh, now we're into E flat. [Music] with the desire to carry on. Your gun is loaded and pointed my way. So don't turn away. I'm pretty sure they were talking about sex there. Don't miss this time. Please don't miss fire. [Music] Wow. Lose keys again. Lose keys [Music] again. Pick a key. Any key can work. [Music] That was fun. That was fun and naughtier than you might think. Y'all tell me if I'm wrong here. Um, okay. Don't you miss fire. Fill me up with desire with the desire to carry on. Okay. Okay. So, maybe the desire is to carry on and not something else. Don't you know uh honey that loves a game? It's always hit or miss, so take your aim. Got to hold on tight. Shoot me out of sight. Uh, don't misfire. But this is where I really thought they were using and or talk. This is an innuendo, right? So, it says, ""Your gun is loaded and pointing my way. There's only one bullet, so don't delay. Got to time it right. Fire me through the night. Come on, take a shot. Fire me higher. Don't you miss this time. Please don't misfire. Okay. I don't know what John is uh confessing to in that little song, but that was fun. That was fun. Okay. Next up is Bring Back That Leroy Brown by Freddy. And this is the one where I had read that they had like 70 vocal tracks that had to be mixed together and mixed and mixed and mixed until it was, you know, few enough tracks to work on their on their main mixer. So, uh, it's about, uh, Jim Croachi who had famously sang Bad Leroy Brown. And Jim Crochi at the time when they were recording this had recently died in a plane crash. And that's what inspired uh Freddy to write this one. So yeah, bring back bring back that Leroy Brown. Uh bet your bottom dollar bill. You're a playboy. Daddy cool with a $90 smile. You know, the lyrics don't make sense until Freddy sings them. So let's go ahead and listen to this song. It is bringing back that Leroy Brown from Queen. Here we go. Bring back that brown. Bring back your bottom dollar. Feel your boy. Yeah. Yeah. Daddy cool with a $90 smile. Yeah. Took my money out of gratitude. Daddy, get right out of town. I got to get up, steady up, shoot him down. Got to hit that lit, too. Bring back, bring back, bring back that Lero. I love the old school. Bring that brown. He got no common sense. He got no brains, but he sure got a lot of style. Can't stand no more in this jail. I got to raise myself with this sentence. Got to get out the heat, step in the shade. You got to get me that general life. [Music] That's awesome. Um, there's the double bass that John's playing. Bring [Music] back that round. Big Mama Lulu Bell. She had a nervous breakdown. Lero taking a honey child away. [Music] Holy [ __ ] [Music] Big bad. I'm going to get that cutie. Bring back. It's so damn fun. [Music] Elected [Music] president. You got to hit him with this bad boy. The way you get [Music] to one and it's in C because I can barely hit that note, right? I can like I can barely eek out a low C, you know, that's where my bass powers kind of meet their match. Um, for a song about a guy or inspired by a guy who had just died in a plane crash, that was a load of fun, wasn't it? The the lyrics don't make sense unless they're in that millu, in that style. Huh? Only F. You know, it's amazing because yeah, there I'm hearing this as a transitory album. You know, I know they're big anthemic sounds that's going to come later. Uh, and I've heard what's come before and and I hear a little bit of that movement especially and you know you know that Bohemian Raps City is on the way and they're just working through all of these techniques, recording techniques, songwriting, uh, overdubs, all of that stuff. and um they're treating the recording itself as a mosaic for their songwriting, you know, and it just all kind of pops in. It's really amazing. Uh the thing that that really is a major accomplishment to me is taking especially for the day um a style of music that their grandparents were probably quite into. you know, some of these more ragtimey and and jazzy uh old school jazzy sort of uh sounds from the 20s, 30s, and 40s uh of, you know, of their grandparents' generation. and they're doing it in a way that makes it fresh and makes it fun and makes it applicable and inclusive. And they did it so well. I bet that nobody even if you wanted not to like it. You couldn't You couldn't not like it. It was too darn good. Bring that big bad Leroy back. Want him back. I don't care where you get them from. Fun. Fun. Let's go on, friends. The next song is She Makes Me and then in parenthesis, Stormtrooper in stilettos. This one's by Brian. And Brian also sings lead on this one. And no, it's not about Star Wars, y'all. You know, I know it says Stormtrooper, but this predates Star Wars. Uh Brian is No, it's it's much um you know, more serious than that. Brian's using the metaphor of a German Stormtrooper, right, to tell us about a man in love with a woman who is, I think, cruel to him. Um Yeah. So, let's let's hear it. I'm I'm fascinated by this. Brian is so darn intelligent that whenever uh I hear one of his songs, it really makes me sit up and listen. So, uh this is She Makes Me by Queen. Here we go. 2 3 4 4 4 1 D to [Music] a She makes [Music] me She is My love. She is [Music] my nice. [Music] Verse two. of I know I'm jealous of her. [Music] Beautiful. [Music] She is my using some suspensions from the parallel minor key. who shall make me as I lie. [Music] But the world will show three hills makes me so I [Music] know the day I leave. [Music] I love her. [Music] She is my nice. It's like a mixelyian progression over that flat 7 that goes back into A. It's really cool. I'll follow [Music] But the world will know how long I'll take. And if I'm very slow, she makes me so. And if I'm very slow, she makes me so. She is my love. She is my love. Beautiful. [Music] It's like a C chord interlaced with that D chord. [Music] It's like deconstructing [Music] itself. And there's an [Music] ambulance. And now it's in minor. [Music] And is he flatlining? Is that what that means? [Music] [Music] Labor breathing. Okay. Okay. So, if I hadn't read ahead and I was just listening to that song, it's using a beautiful 4:1 in a in a bright A major key. Uh, for a lot of the time, I love, she makes me, she is my heart, she is my love, she is my love. I know I'm jealous of her, but she makes me need. She is my love. She is my love. who knows uh who she'll make me as I lie in her cocoon. But the world will surely heal my eels. I'm warm and terrified. She makes me so. And then know I know the day I leave her. I I'll love her still. She is my love. she's, you know, it's you almost think of it as a as a beautiful kind of a an ode love song until that whole ending it starts just breaking down the the sharps that are embedded within that particular key. It doesn't change keys, but it kind of just falls in on itself gradually and becomes uh a minor sounding uh uh key instead of all of the major chords. And with the ambulance there, the labored breast at the end, it it takes on a No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is not loveydovey. This is a person who is delusional. A person, well, maybe not delusional, but a person who is so in love with having a person there, they don't even realize, excuse me, or care that they're being abused in some way. Fascinating. Fascinating. Yeah. Stormtrooper in stilettos, meaning that uh they they may look good in high heels, but deep down they're going to do bad things to you. Yeah. Fascinating. Fascinating. We have one more, friends. It's in the lap of the gods revisited. And again, I heard this one back in uh September of 2001 on on the channel, but uh just like the f the first in the lap of the gods. I don't think that I remember it. Um, I remember that this was one of Freddy's early attempts to create a song that would actively involve their audience, like the audience singing along, kind of like what they would achieve with We Are the Champions and and stuff like that later on. And this was often their concert closer, especially in the mid70s, uh, right uh, after this album was was released in the years after it. So, let's finish up the album. This is In the Lap of the Gods Revisited by Queen. Here we go. [Music] So, the music is not the same. It's not a reprise. about my money in the lap of the gods. I can't see what you want me to be. But I'm no fool. Said the lamb of the [Music] god la. I can see what you want me to be. If you want him to sing along, uh, Freddy, you're going to have to give him a little bit of an easier thing to sing. There's no meaning. Believe me, life goes on and on. [Music] Man, their records just sound like nobody else does. Even all these years [Music] later, that's not true. of the [Music] gods. La. I can't see what you want me to be, but I'm no fool. Yeah, that's not easy. Oh la. [Music] Give him an easier note. [Music] Freddie la. [Music] Oh, but I'm a fool in the life of the gods. [Music] flat 7 to six. Then it's E D C sharp to the A. That's 5 to 1 and D 1 2 D sharp up to the four. That's what they give it to me enough times I can figure it out. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. All [Music] right. Who did it? Wasn't me. If it's in the lap of the gods, that was a heck of a fart from the gods. Right in the wrong spot. I'm sorry. Okay, I don't mean to make uh light of that. I'm just having a good time. What an album. What would we do without these guys? I mean, somebody's got to be queen, right? Uh, in the history of musical development, there needs to be a band that comes together with this unique way of bringing all of these sounds together. And they're so damn intelligent, you know? They can all play. They can all sing. They can all write. And they build and build and build on these recordings to the point where it's like the queen army on these recordings. Instead of just four guys in a room playing their instruments, they make themselves into an ensemble that has no limit in the recording studio. And then they go out on stage and they're one of the best stage bands of all time. They're uniquely talented. just really uh a real special band and uh it is I think an album of transitions. I I went back and I listened to Queen 2 before coming to this one. I haven't listened to Queen One yet, by the way. Um but um you know just being reminded of what came before this was helpful especially with some of the callbacks uh that they made to uh some songs on that on that previous album. I did find a quote from a rock historian named Paul Fowls and he wrote that sheer heart attack saw the band become increasingly focused on the emerging cult figure of Freddy Mercury and his unique brand of rock theater, especially on the single Killer Queen. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they chose to make that a single. It It's a great song. Um, some of these others could have been singles as well. Uh, I'm sure and I'm sure they were. I'm sure this got just a ton of radio play because they're all radio length, radio friendly, and they sound wonderful. Uh, they really do. So, like I said, I've heard a lot of of Queen's best hits over uh the these many years and on the channel. uh but only two albums previously, their second and their fourth, and this was the third. Um so I think that my next album from them should probably be A Day at the Races, which is their fifth, right? So I've heard A Night at the Opera, which is this album's excuse me, followup, and um A Day at the Races comes after that. Plus, it came in second in our poll. So, I think I'll stay in this um era of the band with um you know, the 70s. I know that I put in the poll, this last poll, one of their uh albums from the 80s right after they appeared on Live Aid and then I put in uh Inuendo uh the last one that they put out while Freddy was still alive. And um we decided to keep it here in the 70s. So now I've heard the second, third, and fourth album. Next time it'll be the fifth. And I think I'll get back to it sooner than uh the amount of time it's taken to get me from, you know, this last time that we heard some of their music on the channel to this one because it was just too long. I really enjoy Queen. Uh they're always um an enjoyable an enjoyable listen and a very fun ride and just a reminder of just how um wonderful their their musicianship is and how special they are. You know, a true unique rock band if I ever heard one and uh I have now heard this sheer heart attack from Queen. This has been episode 90 of our extended play lounge. Thanks y'all for being here with me today. I really do appreciate your support and your time. We will see you next time on another edition of the Daily Doug. It's the daily.

Grant us, Lord, we pray, that being rightly conformed to the pascal mysteries, what we celebrate in joy, may protect and save us with perpetual power, through our Lord Jesus Christ, your son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever. Amen. A reading from the Acts of the Apostles. The apostles and presbytors in agreement with the whole church decided to choose representatives and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. The ones chosen were Judas who was called Barsabus and Silas, leaders among the brothers. This is the lever letter delivered by them, the apostles and the presitters, your brothers, to the brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cissia of Gentile origin. Greetings. Since we have heard that some of our number who went out without any mandate from us have upset you with their teachings and disturbed your peace of mind, we have with one accord decided to choose representatives and to send them to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul who have dedicated their lives to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. So we are sending Judas and Silas who will also convey the same message by word of mouth. It is the decision of the Holy Spirit and of us not to place on you any burden beyond these necessities, namely to abstain from meat sacrificed to idols, from blood, from meat of strangled animals, and from unlawful marriage. If you keep free of these, you will be doing what is right. Farewell. And so they were sent on their journey. Upon their arrival in Antioch, they called the assembly together and delivered the letter. When the people read it, they were delighted with the exhortation. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Lord. I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Lord. My heart is steadfast, oh God. My heart is steadfast. I will sing and chant praise. Awake, oh my soul. Awake, liar and harp. I will wake the dawn. I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Lord. I will give thanks to you among the peoples, O Lord. I will chant your praise among the nations. For your mercy towers to the heavens and your faithfulness to the skies. Be exalted above the heavens, oh God. Above all the earth be your glory. I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Lord. God. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to John. Glory to you, O Lord. Jesus said to his disciples. This is my commandment. Love one another as I love you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I no longer call you slaves because a slave does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends because I have told you everything I have heard from my father. It was not you who chose me but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain so that whatever you ask the father in my name he may give you. This I command you love one another. The gospel of the lord. Praise to you Lord Jesus Christ. When I was a kid, my family lived in a neighborhood filled with a diverse mix of people, including several families with kids. Our next door neighbors, Mike and Jean, had five children. Over the years, Jean became close friends with my mother. At one point, Jean gifted my mother a decorative sign that hung in our kitchen. It read, ""Neighbors by chance, friends by choice."" Friendship is a tremendous blessing. Deep friendships don't just happen. People choose each other as friends based on mutual attraction, shared interests, and similar perspectives. Once a friendship is strong and wellestablished, friends can be themselves and express their feelings more openly. Jesus refers to his disciples as friends, saying, ""You did not choose me, but I choose you."" He has also chosen to befriend us, demonstrating his friendship by sharing his true self with us. He has revealed his relationship with the father and showed his friendship by laying down his life for us. While he has done his part, we must also fulfill ours for the friendship to flourish. We need to choose Jesus just as he has chosen us. To remain in his love and friendship, we must love one another as he has loved us and befriend others as he has befriended us. And now we pray to the father our all powerful God who raised Jesus our savior from death. that the Holy Spirit may descend upon the leaders of the church, giving them wise judgment and helping them to read the signs of the times and making them courageous in action. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. Mindful of the Lord's passion, we pray that the world may come to know the love whereby Christ laid down his life for all humankind. We pray to the Lord. Lord, here our prayer that young people may consider lives dedicated to the service of God and neighbor through ordained ministry and lives devoted to the mission of the church. We pray to the Lord. Lord, here our prayer for those who have died and gone before us marked with the sign of faith in a special way. Today we remember Rudy the pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer for the homebound and the sick, for those who care for them, and for all those intentions we offer from the silence of our hearts. For these we pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. Father in your mercy, grant us all for which we ask with faith and devotion through Christ our Lord. Amen. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands. It will become for us the bread of life. Blessed be God forever to share in the divinity of Christ who opened himself to share in our humanity. Thank you. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands. It will become our spiritual drink. Blessed be God forever. Thank you. Pray brothers and sisters that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father. May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his holy church. Graciously sanctify these gifts, O Lord, we pray, and accepting the oblation of this spiritual sacrifice. Make of us an eternal offering to you through Christ our Lord. Amen. The Lord be with you. And spirit, lift up your hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is right and just. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation at all times to acclaim you, O Lord, but in this time above all to lod you yet more gloriously when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. For with the old order destroyed, a universe cast down is renewed and integrity of life is restored to us in Christ. Therefore, overcome with pascal joy, every land, every people exalts in your praise, and even the heavenly powers with the angelic hosts sing together the unending hym of your glory as they acclaim, ""Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosana in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosana in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fountain of all holiness. Make holy, therefore, these gifts we pray by sending down your spirit upon them like the dwfall so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving thanks, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, ""Take this all of you and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you. In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice and once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying, ""Take this all of you and drink from it. For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. [Music] The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity. Together with Leo our pope and William our bishop and all the clergy. Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all. We pray that with the blessed Virgin Mary, mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be co-airs to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your son Jesus Christ. Through him and with him and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen. At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our savior Jesus Christ. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, ""Peace I leave you. My peace I give you. Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will. Who live and reign forever and ever. Amen. The peace of the Lord be with you always. With your spirit. Peace. Thank you. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace. Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. For those who cannot join us in person and receive the eukarist, we now offer this act of spiritual communion. My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the most holy sacrament. I love you above all things and I desire to receive you into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace you as if you were already there and unite myself wholly to you. Never permit me to be separated from you. Amen. Let us pray. We have partaken of the gifts of this sacred mystery, humbly imploring, O Lord, that what your son commanded us to do in memory of him may bring us growth in charity. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. May almighty God bless you. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. The mass has ended. Go in peace. Thanks be to God.",0.039,0.691,0.27,1.0

Amen. A reading from the Acts of the Apostles. Some who had come down from Judea were instructing the brothers, ""Unless you are circumcised according to the Mosaic practice, you cannot be saved."" Because there arose no little dissension and debate by Paul and Barnabas with them. It was decided that Paul, Barnabas, and some of the others should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question. The apostles and elders in agreement with the whole church decided to choose representatives and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. The ones chosen were Judas, who was called Barabus, and Silas, leaders among the brothers. This is the letter delivered by them. The apostles and the elders, your brothers, to the brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Clesia of Gentile origin. Greetings. Since we have heard that some of our number who went out without any mandate from us have upset you with their teachings and disturbed your peace of mind. We have with one accord decided to choose representatives and to send them to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul who have dedicated their lives to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. So we are sending Judas and Silas who will also convey the same message by word of mouth. It is the decision of the Holy Spirit and of us not to place on you any burden beyond these necessities, namely to abstain from meat sacrificed to idols, from blood, from meats of strangled animals, and from unlawful marriage. If you keep free of these, you will be doing what is right. Farewell. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Oh God, let all the nations praise you. Oh God, let all the nations praise you. May God have pity on us and bless us. May he let his face shine upon us. So may your way be known upon earth among all nations your salvation. Oh God let all the nations praise you. May the nations be glad and elite because you rule the peoples in equity. The nations on the earth you guide. Oh God, let all the nations praise you. May the peoples praise you, oh God. May all the peoples praise you. May God bless us and may all the ends of the earth fear him. Oh God, let all the nations praise you. A reading from the book of Revelation. The angel took me in spirit to a great high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. It gleamed with the splendor of God. Its radiance was like that of a precious stone, like jasper, clear as crystal. It had a massive high wall with 12 gates where 12 angels were stationed, and on which names were inscribed, the 12 names of the 12 tribes of the Israelites. There were three gates facing east, three north, three south, and three west. The wall of the city had 12 courses of stones as its foundation on which were inscribed the 12 names of the twel apostles of the lamb. I saw no temple in the city for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb. The city had no need of sun or moon to shine on it. For the glory of God gave it light and its lamp was the Lamb. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Halleluah. Halleluah. Whoever loves me will keep my word, says the Lord. And my father will love him and we will come to him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Halleluah. The Lord be with you. With your spirit. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to John. Glory to you, Lord. Jesus said to his disciples, ""Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my father will love him, and we will come to him, and we will make our dwelling with him. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. Yet the word you hear is not mine, but that of the Father who sent me. I have told you this while I am with you. The advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and remind you of all that I told you. Peace. I leave with you. My peace I give you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid. You heard me tell you, I am going away and I will come back to you. If you love me, you would rejoice that I'm going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you this before it happens so that when it happens you may believe. Gospel of the Lord. Praise to youord Jesus Christ. I believe in one God of heaven and earth of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation, he came down from heaven and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became manc. For our sake he was crucified under Pontious Pilot. He suffered death and was buried and rose again on the third day in accordance with the scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy, Catholic, and apostolic church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. And I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and life for the world to come. Amen. that the church may stand before the world without stain or blemish, holy and obedient to God's word. Let us pray to the Lord.

The two key words with St. Ignatius, projection and commemoration. Use your senses and imagination. You project yourself into the upper room with Jesus the night of the first mass. You imagine how Jesus was dressed, what the food tasted like, what the night was all about with the four cups of wine, the celebration of the Passover. Jesus looking at you, Jesus saying, ""This is my body to be given for you, my blood to be poured out for you. Do this in memory of me."" And then Jesus given us that beautiful seven five chapters of the farewell discourse. Tonight's gospel. You're indeed holy, O Lord, the font of all holiness.

NiI1fJKauOc,17589,2610,289,Understanding God’s Word – Daily Devotional,20250512,"[Music] Here's today's InTouch devotion. Today's scripture reading is 1 Corinthians 2:12 through 3:3. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words. But a natural man does not accept the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them because they are spiritually appraised. But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one. For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he will instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. Chapter 3. And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food. For you are not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men? I just don't understand the Bible. Have you ever thought that? It's clear why those without Christ are unable to grasp spiritual concepts. But why do those of us who know him sometimes struggle? The key here is obedience. As we act on what we read, the holy book comes alive and we begin to hear and understand what God is communicating. However, if we haven't obeyed things he's previously revealed to us, why would he give us his deeper truths? Psalm 25:14 says, ""The secret of the Lord is for those who fear him, and those who revere him are the ones who obey his commandments and are promised a good understanding."" Living a lifestyle of disobedience to the Lord distorts our vision, diminishes our ability to hear, and fogs our thinking. Although we have full access to the mind of Christ, our attachment to our own sinful ways keeps us from tapping into the rich treasures of wisdom found in his word. As you read the scriptures each day, look for God's instructions. Then with reliance upon the Holy Spirit, commit to do what he tells you. When you obey his voice, he'll reveal deeper truths and your understanding will grow.",0.067,0.774,0.159,0.9923
1YB62j5jq6E,26266,578,184,The Elden Ring Movie Is Happening with Alex Garland Directing - IGN Daily Fix,20250523,"What's up everybody? Damon here and in today's gaming news, Elden Ring is headed for the big screen and has a surprising but promising director. And the FDC's case against Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard is finally over. This is your daily [Music] fix. A liveaction Eldering movie is in the works from exmachina and Civil War director Alex Garland. A film based on From Software and Band Dynamo's massive RPG hit is now confirmed to have the filmmaker attached not only as its director but as its writer too. Plot casting details or release date for the Elder Ring movie have yet to be announced. George RR Martin, who helped create the lore for Elder Ring, is attached as a producer on the movie. There's no word yet on how involved From Software or game director Hiataka Miyazaki will be, if at all. Elder Ring shook the gaming world when it took From Software's tough as nails formula Open World in 2022. It's since become a beloved entry in the developers catalog, boasting high praise from critics, we gave it a 10 out of 10, and fans alike. While the team behind it had expressed interest in expanding its bleak fantasy world in the past, few believe their efforts would result in a movie. That is until 2024 when George RR Martin teased that he may have heard a few details about a potential Elder Ring movie. He went on to double down on his comments earlier this year, saying during IGN Fanfest that he had heard some talk about an Elder Ring movie. What do you think of Garland and A24 making a live-action Elden Ring film? Let me know in the comments. Moving on, just days after losing its 2-year-old objection to Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the US Federal Trade Commission has officially dropped its case. The FTC's appeal to block Microsoft's $69 billion deal to acquire the company behind Call of Duty was denied by San Francisco's 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals on May 7th, further cementing the purchase that was originally announced in late 2022. It was a move decided by a three judge panel that brought an end to the FTC's questioning of the July 2023 decision to allow Microsoft to finalize its purchase. As we summarized at the time, Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has faced scrutiny from across the board for more than three years both in the US and worldwide. With some parties concerned that it would see popular franchises like Call of Duty become Xbox exclusives. Microsoft confirmed it had no interest in keeping certain franchises behind lengthy exclusivity periods and sold Activision Blizzard's cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft to satisfy the UK's competition and markets authority objections. The FTC's appeal could have presented a late roadblock to continuing. However, as reported by The Verge, the commission has now dismissed its complaint entirely, stating in a brief filing issued on May 22nd, ""The commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative legislation in this case. Indeed, any fears that Xbox would hold games hostage to its own platform seem to have been unnecessary. The top three bestselling games in the PlayStation store last month were all Xbox games. And finally, today, Marvel fans will have to wait a bit longer to see Avengers Doomsday and Avengers Secret Wars, as Disney has postponed the release dates of both movies. Doomsday has been pushed 7 months from May 1st, 2026 to December 18th next year, while Secret Wars is moving from May 7th, 2027 to December 17th. Variety reports that several other Marvel release dates have been removed from its calendar or altered. February 13th, 2026, which was reserved for an untitled Marvel project, has disappeared. Then the dates of November 6th, 2026 and November 5th, 2027, both previously untitled Marvel films, were changed to just untitled Disney movies. That means Spider-Man Brand New Day will now open before Doomsday. That Sony Marvel sequel, which begins filming this summer, is scheduled to be released on July 31st, 2026. Avengers Doomsday is currently filming in the UK. And that is your daily fix for Friday, May 23rd. Now, over at Humble, you may want to check out the Xbox Game Studio Publisher Bundle. For just five bucks, you get Broken Age, Sunset Overdrive, and Battle Toads.

It absolutely broke our hearts. Kea was alone for weeks on acres and acres of property. She was just soaking wet, terrified. We'll get you out of here, baby. Okay. She was completely shut down, broken. She was tucked into a little tiny ball as small as she could make herself. She would go outside and she would just freeze. It's almost like she's afraid of being left out there again. Hey, little lady. Eventually, I picked her up and I put her on the couch. Four or five days in, she jumped up and laid right next to me and I started crying. She would go and take our clothes and bring them up on the couch with her when we weren't home. She took blankets, sweatpants, t-shirts. She's now craving affection from her half-sleeping foster dad. Eventually, she very slowly and very hesitantly walked up the steps for the first time. Good girl. You made it. Good girl. Seeing her going from the sad, wet puppy that was caught in a crate to cuddling on a couch accepting love and asking for love. It's amazing. We had her for almost two weeks and then we found her her forever and they have been amazing. I just felt super connected to the pictures that I was seeing of her. Kea, it took a little while to get used to her new home. She hid a lot. What are you doing down there? Do you want to be hidden? She didn't want to let us touch her. She was very timid. What are you doing, Kea? You hiding? She didn't want to go outside. Kea was definitely timid at first going out, but as she saw Flare and Raven take off, she felt a little bit more comfortable to go and take off as well. Kea, come here. Now, as she gets excited to go outside, get them, girls. As she gets more and more comfortable, we start to see new things and new parts of her personality. Now she is very cuddly. Her confidence has gone leaps and bounds from where it was in the beginning. Hi. You want to go outside? It's definitely a piece that we didn't know that we were missing.",0.057,0.812,0.13,0.9857

We talk about we talk about Kevin Harland uh putting away some groceries. Man, you should have seen Ally Lefor. Stop it. Who's got this Stop it. Who's got this look ahead to game three which in which includes I understand Ally and you'll have more on this a lineup change. That's right. First of all, it's pregame fuel. It's going towards a good cause. Second of all, you should be judged as a person based on your reactions to having St. Elmo's cocktail sauce. And at the table, I saw a lot of ooze and awe, some tears, some sweating, but none of that from me, by the way. So, I'm gonna give myself props on that one. But yes, speaking of game three, there are a couple things that you need to be concerned about if you're the New York Knicks. Yes, there's the X's and O's, but there is also what's going on internally. And by that, I mean the two benchings that happened in game two that we're about to get to, the starting minutes for these starters, but also the starting rotations. As you alluded to, Ernie, there were reports today that the Knicks were considering inserting big man Mitchell Robinson into the starting lineup in place of Josh Hart. We talked to him literally moments ago. He told us yes, that is a real possibility, but as of our conversation just now, he said he has not decided yet. He said it doesn't mean that one will play more minutes necessarily than the other, but he wants to make that decision the one that brings the best out of the entire group. This would be the first time all year that they tweaked the starting lineup not related to an injury. Josh Hart said, quote, ""I can't preach about sacrifice and then be mad if I'm benched. I feel like if I'm a starter, I earned it. I've played amazing this year, but I've been the 16th man and I've been the third man. So, I'm all in for whatever coach decides."" He had the right attitude. He said the right things. Now, both Carl Anthony Towns and Josh Hart were benched for significant minutes during game two. Cat sat for nearly seven minutes in the fourth quarter and in his 28 minutes played, the Knicks were outscored by 20 points in those minutes. When asked why he benched him, coach said, ""We got in a hole and the group that was in there gave us the best chance."" Now, Josh Hart was benched for two different stretches. Over 10 minutes and nearly 9 minutes in an additional stretch. He admitted this morning, I didn't bring the energy I needed to bring. There will be ups and downs, but whenever I have a bad game, I genuinely do a good job of bouncing back. Brunson told me everything has to be better defensively. It's our rotations. It's our communications. It's it's everything. And offensively, he said, ""Listen, we need to play faster. And when we get down, we have to play with that same aggression as when we're up as well. When we have a great lead, we can't play so self-consciously that we try to slow the game back down. The mentality has to be the same. And a lot of people think it's better for the Knicks to slow the game down because the Pacers pace is so incredible."" That's not what they want to do. They like playing as fast as them with them. They want to get stops, get out and run. The big thing is getting back in the in on the defensive end, especially in transition because that is where the Pacers really hurt them so far in both games this series. Ally, great stuff. Thank you so much. We appreciate you. And uh well, let's I'm not even sure what that would do. Let's Well, let's go to Carmax Me Settle first and then we'll get into a discussion of game three. um so much in this postseason and in this series about uh who's going to perform in the clutch. Both of these games have come down to clutch time. Five-point margin with five minutes or less to go in the game. Indiana's won both of those. Uh the Knicks have been involved in a bunch of them. Uh 10 out of their 14 games have been in clutch time. Okay, let's talk about let's talk about a lineup change if indeed it happens with Mitchell Robinson in the starting lineup. What do you make of it? I have no idea what that would do if um they might be better rebounding, but uh I don't I don't like the change because they are they got they they've only run one play. They run the pick and roll and it's just a a a mismatch right there. Like I just don't understand putting Mitchell and Big Cat out there together what that would do. It'd make them slower. Would they be a better rebounding team? They'll be a better rebounding team, but they'll be worse defensively. So that'll just put them in situations where Shiakum uh and u excuse me and um the Miles Turner would get more. Look at that. This is all he's doing. I mean, I I just don't understand what what you're trying to prove with the the substitution. And not only that, Chuck, when you put him at the five, that brings call Anthony Towns to the four. When he's at the four, he's perimeter based. Me and you don't want him to be perimeter based. You want him to mix it up, go in and out with Mitchell Robinson down there clogging up the lane. He's going to shoot jumpers. Now, he didn't play well. He was benched for those seven minutes. So, I'm anxious to see how he's going to respond. I would want him to be at the five so he could be aggressive and get to the bucket. So with him at the four, I expect a lot of jumpers. Well, for me, if you look at the Knicks and you say, ""Why would you move Robinson in the starting lineup?"" They said they want, like Cat said, I want to play fast. That is exactly why he is in there. So you could play slower so you could slow the game down. What Mitchell Robertson has done his defense, too. Well, he's a great rim, he's a great rim protector, but also he gives you extra possessions. he has been able to dominate, not just play well, but dominate the paces on the offensive board. So now we're saying we want to give more possessions for us. We want to protect the rim to when Hallebertton drives, make Hallebertton and Shiakum perimeter. So those are the reasons why you insert him possibly and play more. He hasn't been a rim protector. He just been beating him up on the offensive glass, but that's extra possession. I know that he's getting him extra possessions, but you said he was a shot blocker. He is a shot blocker. No, he's not. They they they listen, they're killing these dudes because the way they play defense in the NBA, they the Pacers ran the same play a thousand times and they going to be there's mismatches is all over the place because the way they play the big man's trying to guard Hallebert. He's breaking him down. They're getting guys wide open. I don't understand. Listen, it might work. I don't think it will personally. And the thing that bothers me about it, they act like they have played bad these first two games. These two games could have went either way. I don't even know why you're making a change now. It's not like if you get your brains beat in two games in a row. I could see you making a change, but both of these games, one went to over which was was a miracle overtime game and then the last game went down to to one shot. Yeah. But you're on the road now and the Yeah. That's why you don't do it. But these guys, you don't do it on the road. you do it at home because the Pacers are going to come out like gang busters tonight, right? And this is where you say so you so you're telling me they going to try to run with the Pacers? No, they're going to slow the game down by bringing Mitchell Robinson. This is just my theory. I don't know if it's going to uh why he's doing it, but my theory would be he is bringing him in to slow the game down. Cat will be more perimeter. Yes, at times. But when he goes to the box, he has off. Now, who do you double off of? Mitchell Robinson leaving him free for the offensive glass. And then the pick and roll with Brunson, there's a roller now instead of cat picking and popping. But you're talking defense. Josh Hart can score. He can penetrate. He can also get you extra possession. You got to stop these dudes here. If this game is 110 or more, the Indiana Pacers will be up 3. Yeah, but I still need five scorers out there. I I I think you have to stop them at some point. And Seakum had his way. This is just my theory as well. Seakum had his way in the paint. I I thought, you know, Josh Hotart, you know, they're trying to make him into a three-point shooter. I think he'll be better against the second unit as well when he's gone in all of those guys coming in in the second unit. He is a a tough defender and he will play a lot of minutes because he only plays seven guys anyway. Well, it's been it's been catch defense. That's that's or lack thereof. See right here, this is Mitchell Robinson. That's Mitchell Robinson. that that shot does not go down the same way. Ern, if you look at all these plays, I mean now the cat and Mitchell Robin ain't going to be doing anything about that. But if you just watch these plays, Indiana Pacers just run the same play and it's a mismatch. They can't keep these guys in front of them. I I don't think putting Mitchell Robinson out there is going to He was He's doing a great job on the boards. Uh he did a great job keeping guys in front. Remember we showed that the other day how great he was doing. You can always pick out one possession. Hey, listen. They better they better worry about the pace of the game. That's all they got to worry about. But this thing, if this thing is over 110, we're going back to New York for dinner, not to play a game. The um the Indiana Pacers 4-1 at home in this postseason. That one loss at home here at the Fieldhouse came in game three against the Cleveland Cavaliers after they had won the first two in Cleveland. And then in that game three here, uh, the Cavs went wire towire and, um, Donovan Mitchell had 43 and the Pacers never led, trailing by 26. What did they learn from that that will help them going into this game three with a chance to go up three zip? You know, I think they learned that, you know, they have a lot of different weapons on their team, a lot of different guys that can go off. This guy right here, I think, saved game one. Seakum saved game two. We all know that everybody plays well at home. So, I look for them to come out, come out aggressive, come out, you know, to try to put this thing away. But, and if you go back and look at that game, Donovan Mitchell just came out and went crazy. I mean, that was a unique situation. I mean, Donovan came out and went crazy. And then that's that's the only time the Cavs actually played up to their capabilities, that one game. This is game seven for the New York Knicks. There is no turning back. If you lose this game, you cannot be in this series at all. If you win this game, you can extend it. And not even not winning. You're not even winning it by winning this game. You're extending it. And this is game seven for the New York Knicks cuz everybody knows that 159 and0 if a team is up 3 nothing in a best of seven. It's game three coming up at the top of the top of the hour. Take it easy on Shaq eating up set. has no porta potty in sight. I'll just come to your mama house. Don't worry about it. Oh, do you got you got dunked up? Yeah, Boomer got me. Can't wait to see it. Boomer got me. I'm here for it. No, no, he didn't make it, sir. He didn't miss it. He missed it, s Way to block him out, sack. Way to block him out. Defensive player of the year. Defensive player of the year. We're coming back to Gambridge Fieldhouse as we get ready for game three in just a second.",0.058,0.807,0.135,0.9998

shv6vm4s2EM,14676,341,71,"Face the Nation: Cindy McCain, Jack McCain, For Country Caucus",20250525,"[Music] We turn now to the executive director of the United Nations World Food Program, Cindy McCain. She joins us this morning from Kinshasha in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Good morning to you. Good morning. In Gaza, we have this man-made catastrophe with Israeli authorities blocking the entry of all aid from uh March until about May 18th. The Trump administration said Israel needs to let in food. So, are your deliveries consistently now getting through? Well, let's start with the fact that this is a catastrophe, and you're absolutely correct, and I'm very grateful that you are covering this issue. Um, they have let a few trucks in. This is a drop in the bucket as to what's needed. Uh right now we have 500,000 people inside of Gaza that are that are extremely food insecure and could be on the verge of famine if we don't help bring them back from that. We need to get in and we need to get in at scale, not just a few dribble of the trucks. Right now it's, as I said, it's a drop in the bucket. So how many trucks need to be getting in daily to address the scale of the need you see? And and can they get into northern Gaza? Well, prior to the, you know, during the ceasefire, I should say, we were getting in 600 trucks a day. Uh, right now we're getting in maybe a hundred, something like that. So, it it's not nearly enough. And it needs to be going to the correct places. So, the various gates, it's inconsistent as to how the gates are open. It's inconsistent as to the roads we can use. The roads that are the better roads, the ones that can get us further along, aren't open at all. Um, it's complicated right now. And and again, I will tell anybody who will listen, we need to get in and get in at scale and be allowed to feed these people before a further catastrophe occurs. Your organization announced at least 15 of your trucks were looted when they entered southern Gaza on route to to bakeries. Israel has consistently said that the looting is being carried out by Hamas. Have you seen evidence that it is Hamas stealing the food? No, not at all. not not uh in this round. Listen, these people are desperate and they see a world food program truck coming in and they run for it. Uh this this doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organized crime or anything. Has simply to do with the fact these people are starving to death. And so we will continue to go in. We will continue to go in with food and the kinds of supplies we need to help the bakeries operate and make sure that we can continue to do that and and hopefully be able to do more of it. But again, we can't do this unless the world community puts pressure on this. Uh we can't be allowed to sit back and watch these people starve to death with no outside diplomatic influence to help us. Uh these these these poor souls are really really really desperate. And uh you know, having been in in a food riot myself some years ago, I understand the desperation very well. Well, 5 days ago, Prime Minister Netanyahu uh vowed to take control of all of Gaza, which seems to be a shift from going in, carrying out raids, and then withdrawing. We've seen the Pope speak out. We've seen the leaders of France, of Canada, of the UK calling the cutting of aid egregious. Netanyahu said criticism like that is feeding Hamas and really feeding anti-semitism. What do you make of that push back from him that criticisms of the state are feeding hate? What I do know is you're not feeding people. And the most important part of this is that's what we're supposed to be doing. I'm very grateful for anyone, the Pope, any of the folks that did did shout out and say, ""Listen, we need to get more in, but I can't tell you as to what exactly what Netanyahu is thinking or anything else."" What I do know for a fact is that we need food to get into Gaza to avoid an utter catastrophe. The Israeli army had announced aid will be distributed under what they described as an American plan. Um, Prime Minister Netanyahu said it'll be American companies giving food directly to Palestinian families in safe zones secured by the Israeli military. There's reporting in the Washington Post that these are armed private contractors doing logistics. Palestinians will have to submit to identity checks to be fed and that would replace the UN coordinated networks presumably also the World Food Program. Do you know how much longer you will be allowed to operate in Gaza? I've not seen a plan from anybody. Uh we continue to operate doing what we do best and we are the largest and the best at what we do, I might add. Um I we've never been a plan has never been proposed to us. We haven't heard uh in in the press, at least from the administration, any of the details either, but we do know that the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabe, announced back on May 9th, that this is going to be a US initiative involving only Israeli security. The Israelis are not distributing food. Secretary Rubio was just in Rome. He said he did meet with you. Did you share with him any of your concerns? Well, we had a very frank discussion about exactly what was going on and what we could do to help alleviate a lot of this. Um, some of it I'm not sure that they were completely clear on how we operate and the size that we are and the logistics ability that we have to be able to do this. So, so we had a very nice discussion. As you know, uh, the Rubio family and the McCain family have been friends for a very long time. And so I was grateful that he would take the time to listen to what what we had to say and let us discuss exactly how we feel we should be able to operate. Did he assure you that the US supports the UN and the world food program continuing to supply food in Gaza? We didn't really discuss the US participation in any of this. He was really really concerned with and really trying to understand how we operate and and the need for what exactly what we do. We will work with anybody as long as it feeds people and feeds people safely, I might add, uh, on the ground and keeps our people and people from other agencies uh, safe as well. Executive director of the World Food Program, Cindy McCain, thank you for your time this morning. Thank you very much for having me. And we'll be right back. And we're back with another McCain. Jack McCain is the son of Cindy and the late Senator John McCain. He's a Navy veteran who served in the Afghanistan war and he joins us now from Kyoto, Japan. Good to have you here. Thank you. Incredibly glad to be here. So, we know when you were in Afghanistan, you flew alongside and helped to train some of the Afghan Blackhawk pilots. Why is it important to you now to speak out on their behalf? Are any of your personal contacts there at risk? Yes. Um, uh, basically everyone that we were unable to get out is at risk. Uh, these pilots and crew members fought the Taliban toe-to-toe. Um, and because of that, the Taliban is trying to seek them out for reprisal, something that they distinctly promised that they would not do. Um, so not only they are they in danger, but we owe them a debt. Uh, I believe that I'm vertical and still on this earth because of the efforts of my Afghan pilots and crews. Um, and not only do I owe them personally, but the nation owes them a debt of honor. Uh, one that we have yet to repay. Um, everyone, interpreters, uh, ground troop pilots, um, that worked and fought alongside the United States at our behest should be able, uh, to be evacuated here to the United States and should be taken care of. So you were active duty at the time of the very chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I know you helped to get Afghans out during that period of time. There were a lot of Afghans airlifted out. Um who was left behind and and what promises were made? Yeah, the problem is everyone was left behind. Um whether it was family members uh including family members of US servicemen uh whether it was um pilots, crews, the people that I worked with, special forces, uh we did everything we could to get as many as we could out. But due to the chaos of the withdrawal and frankly the lack of planning on the part of the United States government, it was up to individuals uh and sometimes smaller military units to help either. In my case, I had to triage who we were going to take out. Um, I had to prioritize uh operational pilots over pilots in training versus crew members in the back. Um, simply because everyone was trying to do everything they could. Um, so we have tens of thousands that fought alongside us left behind. Each one of them in danger in their own way, not to mention family members uh that can be used as tools of leverage against those that are even here in the United States now. And and to that point, under the Taliban right now, the daughters, the wives, the female family members of a lot of these people who worked with Americans are facing some pretty um tough conditions. However, this administration just recently said through Homeland Security that it is safe for Afghans to return. So, those here could be sent back. Um some Afghans who had uh arrived here and been given temporary protection. Does what the US government said match in any way what you are hearing is happening on the ground? Um, I would disagree with the uh entire notion that it is safe for anyone, especially if they've been in the United States, to return to rule under the Taliban, whether they are male, female, young, old, that regime has proven itself to be to not only have gone back on every promise they made to us, but to be um to have no problem using human lives as uh pawns to imprison, torture, rape, kill uh even sell into slavery. So there are a number of veterans of the war in Afghanistan who serve currently as lawmakers in the United States Congress and it is Congress that sets the number of visas for the these special immigrant visas, SIVs. We checked there are more than 144,000 applicants in the pipeline, but there are only 11,000 visas left. That's not even counting family members here. Have you gotten any indication from the lawmakers you know that they are going to raise that cap? No, I have not. Um, and it is an utter travesty that that is the case. Uh, people on both sides of the aisle uh had have served in Afghanistan or have fought alongside Afghans much like me. Um, and the uh political theater that has taken place of simply ignoring the problem um can only be summarized by the word despicable. Uh this is an issue of humanity. This is an issue of national honor and this is a debt that we owe. Um so I would urge lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to solve this problem because it is not going to go away. Um it is your job to legislate. So please do so. So that's in the hands of lawmakers. That was a problem even during the last administration. Now though, we have this extra complication where the Trump administration has put in orders to restrict refugee admissions and said the US should prioritize people who can quote fully and appropriately assimilate and who do not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. That's made it hard for Afghan refugees, family members to enter here. Um, how do you reassure the public that these refugees are not a risk? Even the vice president of the United States has said he does not trust the vetting of refugees. Well, um I mean I think I passed the ultimate test in that I literally put my lives in my life in these people's hands. Um so not only are they worthy of trust, but they are worthy of our care. Uh the vetting process has taken place. It continues to take place. And if vetting is the issue, fantastic. Let's pass legislation to solve that problem. Let's make sure everyone up to this point has been vetted. Before I let you go, um your father famously said, ""It matters less that you can fight, but what you fight for is the real test."" I know you feel passionately about this particular issue. Can you ever see yourself entering politics to fight for other issues? Uh that's a a very interesting question, one that I happen to get asked fairly regularly. Um, and I would say trying to follow his example that uh the best life is one lived adventurously and if in service of a cause greater than one's self-interest, I'm doing that. And if someday that does take me to office in service of the nation, then by all means. But to live a life simply focused on the single goal of attaining public office is not in my mind a life purposefully lived uh in in service and office. It is a purposefully lived one, but that should not be the overriding goal of your life. We will continue watching. Jack McCain, thank you for weighing in on this important issue. Thank you so much. We'll be back in a moment. This year, the bipartisan group led in the past by then Congressman Mike Waltz went from the House floor, where they had just passed the president's spending bill in an early morning vote, down to the Washington Mall. Cleaning the Vietnam War Memorial may have been delayed, but the mission was not deterred by either lack of sleep or rain. You were up all night. Why did you show up in the rain in your suit to still do this? because this is way more important. You know, sometimes people ask me, ""God, Seth, Washington is a mess today. Is it as bad as Iraq?"" And every single day, the answer is this is easier than the war. And it's important to keep that perspective. Do you think that the divisions in our country now are in the same place, different from what this country went through around the time of Vietnam when it was a very divided country? You know, I think there are actually a lot of a lot of parallels and one of the lessons that we should learn is to to do right by our veterans if for no other reason. We got to work on coming together. And you know, it's it's difficult when uh it feels like we've got the divider and chief to quote one of his former officials uh at the head of our government right now. But that doesn't mean that those of us in Congress, especially veterans, can't work together. Iowa Republican Zach Nun spent 20 years as an Air Force intelligence officer and still serves in the Air Force Reserve. North Carolina Democrat Don Davis also served in the Air Force and told us that his work as a mortuary officer at nearby Andrews Air Force Base makes Memorial Day especially important to him. After the wall was clean, we talked about their work together on Capitol Hill. Congress did give that boost to pay last year to the troops. Is it enough in this economy though? Is the country doing enough? We know that families are still struggling to make ends meet, taking care of the dayto-day, kids putting gas in the tank. Um so it's definitely I'm sure not enough but we are moving I believe there with our junior listed in particular in the right direction not only with pay but looking at broader quality of life issues housing um child care that's available on our installations. America spends more than any other country on its defense. How is it possible we have this happening to our troops? We've tried to work together on things that not only help veterans, leading veteran suicide bill, uh assistance to uh families in the military. I'm proud of the bill that we just passed is going to be able to extend a 22% tax cut to military families. I'm proud that we got a child tax credit in there. I'm thrilled that we were able to get our bill in there that worked towards giving a family a tax credit for adoption. We've got two adopted kids. This goes a long ways to helping a middle American family, whether you're military or not, be successful going forward. But I want to also say it's important to do all of this for recruitment, retention, addressing quality of life. We recruit families, but also when I think about being right here at the Vietnam Memorial and I think about our service, my service, you don't do it for the money. You do it because you love the country. Um, so because of that love for the country, realizing that families are fighting for our country, the service members and their families, we have to continue to just look and at prioritizing um our military families. How do you tell people now um encourage them to enter public service at a time when they're being told even by the federal government private sector is going to be more rewarding for you? Look, Margaret, I think you highlight a really important part here. There's a number of ways that people can be called to serve. It's one of the things that I think has actually made us most combat effective in Congress is finding people who are missionoriented, who are working together. I tell my kids the things that they could potentially learn in the military will echo throughout their entire life. But it's up for every American to make that decision, that pathway. You're right. Less than 1% of Americans are serving, but that 1% distinguishes itself time and time again. And there's lots of great ways to public service. Don and I have worked together to get more teachers, more nurses, more doctors. There's all great calls to public service. The federal government has a role to play in this, but ultimately it's up to Americans to decide how do they best give back to the communities that they represent. We certainly felt that military service was a way to do it, but I think we came to it in our own pathway. And and I would love to say to any young person listening right now that's remotely interested, I had an amazing career serving in the United States Air Force. I love serving our country and it was definitely a great career for me. And now as a member of the Armed Services Committee, we're doing everything to continue to make sure all of our branches are vibrant and we're doing things to make sure we support them. Give it a shot. When we talk about the Vietnam War and memorial behind you, there are it looks like students coming um to reflect this morning. Three million people died in that war. 58,000 Americans among them. I wonder this Memorial Day, who are you thinking of? Look, this is an ancient history. This is living history. I think of my uncle who flew spotter planes over Vietnam. I think of my dad who had the choice between enlisting or joining the ROTC program. I also think about my mother who got back home taking care of, you know, at that point um her career as a nurse. my aunt who had two little girls. Uh these are the stories that I think it's so important that young people do have the opportunity to learn about. One so we never enter this kind of a situation again where we send men and women off to fight. They come back home not to a hero's welcome but as a despised class. Peace through strength is a real deterrent, but also knowing that we've got a military that when we commit to fight, we have to go in there knowing that we have a strategy, a plan, and that we're not going to be bringing people home injured, broken, or shattered, to a country not ready to receive them. It's so um warming to see young people, kids walking through and looking at the Vietnam Memorial. I think of those throughout my community back home in um eastern North Carolina who I know served our country during Vietnam. And I go beyond Vietnam. Um I think of um Corporal Ryan Russell who's from East North Carolina who was killed in Iraq and have a special relationship with his mom Kathy. And we're doing everything to commemorate those who are killed. um not just Vietnam but in all wars and conflicts um so that they know that the families that we're standing with them there's a way to um get through this this healing process that so many um families are going through those tears um that they're not alone. Um, but not only that, but to embrace nationally when we see this to think about all those who ultimately gave their lives in service of our country and we will be right back. That's it for us today, but on behalf of all of us here at Face the Nation, to our military, our veterans, and especially their families, thank you for your service. We are all in your debt. Until next week for Face the Nation, I'm Margaret Brennan. [Music]",0.077,0.8,0.123,0.9996
VwqMOKGh3OI,26860,2482,256,The Magic Lives On At Lakeland Antique Mall /Trying New Chic-Fil-A Sandwich & Retro Disney Shopping,20250525,"Welcome everyone. Adam the Woo here as the recording of the Saturday, May 24th, 2025. Today I'm going to spend the day first by going to get some coffee at 7-Eleven. Then from there taking I4 westbound, going over to the Lakeland Antique Mall, see if I can get a few things for my home. You know, even though I've been here for a year and a half, it's still doesn't feel like it's completely finished. probably never will be because not going anywhere. One thing nice about having a house and not having to move again is you can start collecting things where before I really didn't really have a lot of items cuz I was going from apartment to apartment, downsizing, etc. knowing I would have to move, pay more rent. All that is gone now. So, I know I'm going to be here for a very lengthy time so can add some stuff, make it feel a little more little more home, home feel, if you will. So, I'm going to do that today. Head over to the antique mall, see what I can find. Before that, going to move some stuff out of my garage, my last year's Halloween decor. This year, I'm going to go all in on my haunted yard. And I've got a storage unit. last month purchased a storage unit. Well, rented a storage unit. So, I'm going to take my skeletons, my headstones, all that out of the garage, move those over there, and then hopefully today and through the course of now, when I'm in town, now through early October, we'll buy more stuff for the yard, put it in the storage unit, and then early October, transfer it all back over here and have the yard of war. Anyway, let's see where the day leads. Long introd inviting you to join me wearing my hello spring shirt. Is it still spring? It's not summer yet. Feels like summer. It's still spring. It's appropriate. Join, shall you? Yeah. All of this. Going to move over to the storage unit. These skeletons again. Headstone. The big pumpkins. Skeletons in here. Skeletons in here. Now, this doesn't take up a lot of space in my garage, but since I'm going to be adding a lot more, really don't want to have this stuff being, you know, taking up space in the garage all year when I'm not using it. And I got some Christmas decor. I got my first blow mold last year, and I think I'm going to start going hard during Christmas season as well. So, I have plenty of room to store all of it. Now I'm back in town. Can transfer the stuff over and put it away and then maybe today buy some stuff and you know over the from now till October buy even more skeletons. I got it all in the car except this one tub. But it's just right down the road the storage unit. So not too far. I can always go back and make another trip. And I could probably readjust the car a little bit and fit this in there. Just throwing it all in there kind of quick like it just I don't have room for this so have to come back for that one. This will open up a lot more space along this wall here to put something in the garage. My popcorn bucket and sipper collection is really coming along. I don't always give a closeup of this for anyone interested. Some of them have made cross-country commutes to be here and settled into my celebration spot. Most recently, the Yeti from the Matterhorn Herald. I'm in the elevator now. Kevin's here. Are you ready to put this stuff away, Adam? No, this isn't Kevin. This is Kevin. Yes. One day. One day. It's already Halloween decorating time. Putting Halloween decorating time stuff away. I probably should have got something on the first floor, but yeah, what's done is done. It's fine. It's all part of the experience. Skeletons and pumpkins walking through the storage space. I want to hit that fire extinguisher right there. It's going to be a fun year. And I'm excited about how much more space I already have in the garage. I can put something up against that wall. There it is. Plenty of plenty of space in here. What' you say? It's like a And this is bigger than a New York apartment. New York City apartment. It's massive. That's true. Plenty of space. So, I put this in here last month cuz I I didn't want to have this thing for a month with nothing in it. So, I put my little popping out of the ground skeleton burster thing coming out of here. 4 foot 4ft height skeleton. And it's insulated. They have the AC on in here, too, which is kind of nice in case I don't know. Guess your stuff will stay nice and uh nice and cool. Here's the guardian right here watching over the storage space right over here. I made the comment when I opened this door that, you know, I'll never fill this up, but you never know in a year or two how much crap will be in here. Halloween and Christmas stuff. But for now, that's all that's in there. Solitary confinement skeleton. Need a coffee for the road here at the Art Deco 7-Eleven. And on the way to Lakeland, they actually expanded the lane. So, it's a little quicker commute to Lakeland. Now, for westbound moving very smoothly, I'm happy to say, well, I just said, I'm going to reiterate it. They have expanded the lane, so you don't see the backup here as often. It still happens, but not as frequently, which makes the Mickey Power Pole and myself very happy. So, what used to take an hour to get to Lakewood Antique Mall takes like 31 minutes now, just approximately. Oh, we've arrived at Bob's Carpet Mart. How was that traffic on I4? That's great, right? I would never want to live over there, but a lot smoother. We'll see how 5:00 is. Celebration to Davenport to 27. Smooth sailing. Yeah. Used to be three lanes. Now it's four lanes. Still doesn't make it any easier to get over to Tampa St. Pete. But we've arrived at the antique mall. We're going in Monday through Saturday till 7:00 p.m. and Sunday to 6:00 p.m. Oh, look at this. This is like a new little logo. Adventure awaits. Established 2016. They moved into this new location a few months ago. I was in here about a month ago and this engine was sold, but they have Whoever bought it has not been in here to pick it up. Got my cart here. I always like to have a cart. You never know what I'm going to purchase. These are the rules for the cart. Doesn't say anything about not putting coffee there. So, this has been sold for like a month. Yeah. Who do you think bought this? This one was a lot of money cuz those are $4,000 a piece. So this probably is what? 10,000. You think that much? Maybe. It is a classic theme park attraction. It was used at Universal Studios to 2023. Did you ever ride on this when it was open? Oh yeah. Which seat did you like? The front or the back? It was just small. Like it's like Barntormer. Yeah. It's like barntorm. I am looking for for my home is more wall art. I'm always looking for more stuff to put on the walls to to make the house a little more decorative and things like there's a bird cage with flowers in it there as well. So, I'm going try to at least get one or two pieces of wall art today. Non-D Disney wall art. I don't want to go full Disney in my house. Kevin, you need this for your living room. I think that's the wall art that you need. That's That's pretty good. White Castle. That's a$170 $179 right there for that. What is this here? Is this like a It's got nails in it. Is that like some sort of like a like a voodoo doll? Why is there a skull down there? Is that a real skull? It's like a monkey skull or something. That is a a 12th century monkey skull necklace. Okay. The Lakeland antique ball. And then up here we can see the screwdriver of a Look at that. Oh, the lady. Yeah, that's a flathead. Right underneath the white floor in a nutshell. Oh, I love these. These like metal. Get my reflection out of there. It's like a chariot. Like the little 1903 bulky mule is what that's called. Little chariot race thing. And it works. Oh, this is like nightmare fuel. Look at this. Look at that right there. Look at that. It's like made in Germany. How about a Roman helmet over here? Where do you see that? Right here. Roman helmet next to Chucky. I was looking at Chucky. And then Mickey up here. Look at this. You got Law, Order, and Punishment book holders. Oh, that's a robber. They got the robber mask on. The quintessential robber mask. I've never seen a robber wear that in real life. Kind of reminds me of that place in Jersey that has the logo of the smiling guy face. Or is that a Masberry Park? I think we got little ventriloquist dummy over here. Oh, I could learn how to be a ventrilicus for $89 with that book right there. Some of this stuff is really awesome. There's two icons of fast food goodness up there. You got Ronald. You got the Colonel. Colonel looks like very vintage. I mean, Ronald's very vintage, too. But the Colonel here a month ago, I saw this picture of Jesus. This is the Garden of Gethsemane, and I didn't buy it, and I kind of regret not buying it. So, that's something I think would be kind of cool to have. I don't even know what year that would be, but that definitely is a one of one. Can't get it off of there. Maybe it doesn't want to be sold. It was meant to be. Didn't buy it a month ago. Thought I probably should have got that. I could have found a place in my my house. So, went ahead and got it. It's $49.99. Have to look it up. The artist name is P E or D E Weer Wetter or maybe Essie Weider. Yeah, I don't know. There's another one that I kind of want to get at some point, too. I remember at my grandparents house, they used to have a photo of the older guy and he had like the loaf of bread and I think he had like a meal and he was like had his hands in the praying position. kind of like a vintage Americana photo. Like to get that at some point, but I like this. I don't know where I'm going to put it. I'll find a spot for it. There's a black hole lunchbox. I need to rewatch the black hole. It's been been a few years. There's a beetle juice down there. Beetleju. That one talks. What year was that? Probably late 80s. His head spins, too. Oh, like the exorcist. This is wild. This is a signed Peter Sellers vinyl songs for the swinging sellers right here. $199 Peter Sellers from the Pink Pan Pink Panther fame. Cluso has signed to Mike. Peter Cellers has signed that album for $200. I love that. Kind of neat. I saw it on TV. The brownie star Mike Camera. I can buy it here. That is $80 for that. Maybe a little too much. There's also this which is kind of horrifying. That's kind of neat, but I don't know if I came out. I used to have these. Well, in the early '8s, I had these. These came out in 78, which had been four years old. So, a year or two after that, I think I had a set of these. I remember the Garfield cups. It's amazing. The size of mugs and drinks changes dramatically as you get older. You know, like this right here would just be like a a sample sample cup. But the uh back in the day, people with drink lots. Kind of like these little uh little carvings here. Almost almost has like a little tiki style to it. They are $15 each. I could probably find a place on a shelf for these. I kind of like those. I think I might I might grab those. Look at this pirate over here. But I'm leaning towards both of these. I like how they're kind of similar, but they're both different. This actually might be the man and woman, like husband and wife. So that's my interpretation. I'm going to get these. This is from 1985. I do not see a price on it, but I really want this. The magic lives on Walt Disney Home Video. I can put that in my garage. 85 retro Mickey Sorcerer Mickey 1985. Walt Disney Home Video. I want that. They asked about that banner. $150. I said sold. Also, Drew is here. Hey, everybody. Drew in the moment. I'm in the moment. And uh we have saved ourselves for walking back in here cuz I feel like you probably know more about this area than we do. a little bit about it. You can show show us some of the stuff back in here. I'm surprised this is has not sold yet. Kevin needs this in his garage. No, you can't drive around with it. Large Marge. I don't want or mini Marge. Mini Marge. I I don't want to, you know, make it feel bad. Could I put this over my golf cart? Maybe like Dude, I think so, man. Is this drivable? It's not. Oh, that's okay. They They wanted to actually do that. Get a uh get some batteries like a golf cart. Get it rolling around. Celebration. That would be amazing. They would love it. The HOA would love random swan. Where did that swan come from? Oh, that's Grand Fian. It's from the lobby. Last time I was here, I rang that bell in the back and just about gave me a heart attack. I deafened all you guys. Today, you give multiple people heart attacks. I won't ring the bells. I won't ring the bell back there today. So, I'm looking for Halloween stuff. Got the storage shed. Oh, this is kind of neat, too. This isn't Halloween, but I like this little kind of retro. And right now, guys, we have Mr. Adam from Port Orleans Princess Room Furniture over here in the the vault collectible area. It's all the way in the back corner of the Lakeland Antique Mall. All kind of stuff from Universal, Disney, Central Florida stuff. Mostly Disney and Universal. A lot of Universal tribute store stuff up there. 2017 HHN. That's kind of neat. That skull. Look at these. Oh, look at this like punk rock skeleton right here. That right there. It's like you can rub this and get the genie coming out here. You can make some wishes here at the sink. You can't wish for more wishes. That's the one That's one of the main rules. That's one rule. This is all Citywalk now. Right here, this is all water. And I've always heard So, look over here. There's the original Hard Rock Cafe. There's the Psycho House, I think, from like Psycho 3 over in that corner. All that's bulldozed now. And then you got this Globe. I always heard this Globe, which is not a Universal Orlando anymore. This one was moved to Hollywood. And that's the one you see at the entrance to Universal Hollywood. This is like uh right after the park originally opened. Check it out. Nickelodeon still there. And then over here where Hard Rock used to be has now been moved to kind of like right there. Bigger version. Been looking for two more rocking chairs. I bought a couple in the Cracker Barrel last month, but I still have room for more. If I have a big group visiting, they can relax in the rocking chairs. This This is like a $100 more than what a Cracker Barrel rocking chair would be, but this one was used at Fort Wilderness. I could have I could have a Disney resort rocking chair if I so choose. I don't know. Not sure about that one. This is interesting. I was not expecting this Ronald Reagan film, Bedtime for Bonsza, over in the HHN Universal Pictures here. Kevin, was this something at HHN once? The Reagan Bedtime for Bonso. Uh, they put those on the construction walls. They do the different movie posters for the construction walls. I thought that was Nope for a second. Remember Nope had the Oh, yeah. the monkey. That's kind of neat. Ronald Reagan right there. [Music] All these news releases. I don't read books, but I will read vintage news. 91. I'll get that one. Books are too long, dude. Look at this. HHN horror nights 10. Like you get a you can get a set uh salt and pepper shaker there from something from the tribute store. These are pretty neat, too. These are photographs taken when they open the Back to Future, the ride. See the lightning striking the clock tower there. And here you got Michael, Mary, Tom [Music] Wilson at the opening. Handcarved canes over here. This almost almost looks like a an octopus or maybe like a squid head. It's pretty sturdy. That's $170. I like that. It's cool looking. A bunch of old retro baseball cards in here now from like 86 8 let's say early 86 mostly into 87 tops which is the wood grain tops. I was super into collecting baseball cards until probably like 92. So like 87 to like 92. So we're getting into the dawnress up here. 91 89 score. Now 88 score holds a special place in my heart because I I remember correctly 88 score was the first time score put out baseball cards. I was living in Niceville, Florida, and I asked for the entire set of 88 score baseball cards for my birthday in 88. And since 88, I have since misplaced, lost, and don't have them anymore. But for $22, I can relive my 88 youth are living in Niceville, Florida, collecting baseball cards like nobody's business. I can reby the entire set of 88 score, which I think was the first set that score put out. Before that, it was just like Tops, Dais Fleer, and I I think I'm going to buy this for $22. It's the complete set over here. And then you get into Bowman 9990 right here. You get into some of the tops sets over here. Wow. I remember this. The Dawn's highlight set. If they had, you know, if they had an 87 wood grain tops set, I would buy that, too. I remember 92 Fleer as well. Not seeing the complete set of 87, but I am going to get I am going to get that set right there. There's two of them. $22 each. There's also Dris 88, Dondris 91. That was back when Topps kind of ruled the cards the card game and then other ones started to started to kind of come out as well. Yeah, I'm going to get I I got to get the key. There it is. The deal of the day right here. Magic lives on. Walt Disney home video date stamped 1985. Kevin seems to think this is hand painted. What do you guys think? It does look hand painted, dude. It kind of does look hand painted. Hell yeah. I'm going put a crack in it. Is that awesome? That is amazing. It did not have a price, but I asked and they sold it to me right there. Cheaper than we thought. Lakeland Antique Mall. 150. They were asking the all new Lakeland Antique Mall. Half the size of the the old one, but just as amazing. This may or may not be the thumbnail. All right, we're taking off. See you later, Drew. Also, I forgot to point out your your shirt is like Edward Scissor Hands giving not Chewbacca a haircut, but a torso cut. A torso cut. All right, good hanging out, man. Absolutely. See you. Took a commute over to a place that used to be at the antique mall is now over on Colonial. Recycling the magic. My second time hopping in here. Been here since they moved. First time. Is it big? Is it bigger than the old spot? It's a bigger space. Yeah, they got more stuff. What about this? You can put this in your living room right here. This looks like nightmare fuel. Like a creepy clown Mickey. His head's a little cracked over here. Should buy that. This is from uh MGM, right? That is Catastrophe Canyon. Catastrophe canyon. I recognize a piece from from that. She put that in my in my bedroom. This is great, dude. You need that for the garage. Oh, it's so old. From Chester Hers. Is that from Main Street? Star Wars. Oh, that's a Taylor's. Oh, it's a Town Square prop. You can tell by looking at Star Wars. I like that though. I put that on the front of my uh golf cart. White Lightning. What do you have new in here? Was that in here last month when I was in here? I don't think he was. How much you want for that? I'm not selling them. Just a prop. Make an offer. Make an offer. This is the best thing that I saw pop up that I I went to see in person. Tinker Bell right here. What are we looking at? So, there's going to be Oh, this was like the David David Copperfield uh dining experience. You're talking about this? Well, the shirt. Oh, that is a prototype. It was going to be that is a jellyfish prototype from Nemo from the ride. Yes, that's a prototype. Oh, and that's that's the copper that's the copper field at Studios. It never happened. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Was that Pleasure Island supposed to be? It was going to be They were going to have I don't know what I heard it was going to be at Studios. I heard Studios and then I also heard they were trying to do it at Pleasure Island. Okay. Who's this? How much is that the shirt? 295. Not sure. Utilador signs. These are from the tunnels at Magic Kingdom before the new Fantasy Land expansion. Pirates. Yeah. Not a blanket. Should I recognize the hair color? Mhm. Oh, I know what it is. Great Movie Ride. It's a munchkin. It sure is. There we go. That's from Great Movie Ride. Yeah, it is. Wow. Yeah, I see it now. I see it now. But can you hear the song? Mhm. So, was this in the ride or was this just like a mold they use to make? So, that would be an extra. You know how they always have backups? Okay. That's the hairpiece. That is the wig. And I'm going to show you. That's amazing. It's cool. Oh, you have this the actual photo from the one with the ride, too. There's the munchkin in the window. Look at that right there. That is cool. Definitely not a pirate and definitely not a blink. The Bay Lake. So that's the boat that not 7C's. The other boat going over there, not the river boat. There's Richard Prior down there and James Dean. Where's the Richard Prior from? Uh Planet Hollywood. Planet Hollywood. Behind the bar. caught with the wind. How they got a green army man over here. The first 24-hour event. The one that that was called Rock Your Disney size. That was on the train station. I got a picture of that, too. I did three of the 24-hour events. 2012 13 or 14 and the 2015. I don't think I went to the that one though. I went to two at Disneyland. May I borrow you for a second and take a photo? Bad. Six bucks for these. There's the 50th. The catastrophe that was WDW's 50th. How do you get that back in there? Well, this I think this was from the Disney Store, right? This display this part of a Montreal. Looks like a Montreal door. Wait, you got to do There goes the Montreal. There goes the Montreal door. I took that cadence from the Disneyland train. The announcer on the Disneyland train when it's like when he's pulling into the station. The way he talks is that's how I got that. The cadence of that. Now pulling into Walt's original Magic Kingdom. Yeah, they're nice enough to let us peruse around. They're in doing their closing procedures now. So, we got to make it quick. We got here right as they were closing. They said, ""Oh, come on in. I'm going to buy some Disney dollars while I'm in here."" So, got to make it fast, but I want to check this place out. It's a little bit of a ways from the antique mall, but worth stopping in. Okay. Peter Pan. So, that was at MCO at the Disney Store at MCO. Wow. Mickey's nephew. Look at Goofy up there. I didn't even see him. He's kind of hiding in the train. Look at these sippers right down here. Look at this. Donald sippers. They should bring these back at a modern version at the parks. A lot of Donald stuff in here. So, Adam, one year from now, when you see these pop up in the parks, are you going to take credit for it for those? when someone's like, ""Oh, I have a great idea, but actually they just watched your video and re-releases."" I mean, it would be a clever coincidence. Those are cute. Kind of like this one. Look at this. The cake castle right down here. Actually have a photo in front of the cake castle. There's the poster. 25th anniversary. This old mannequins Pleasure Island. It's like a sushi place now, right? Pleasure or mannequins. I think it's that first Japanese steakhouse place you walk in.

They changed the thing to Hollywood Studios, but there used to be a screen used fountain that was in the movie. When Daryl Hannah gives the fountain to Tom Hanks, it's in his bedroom next to his bed. That was at studios for the longest time. And this was the sign that was in front of that. I always wonder what happened to the the splash fountain. It's probably just in a dumpster somewhere. I don't know what this is. Is cool. This Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. They have $700 price tag on this. Catch it. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. A new arrival when Big Thunder opened. They also have some stuff from the bakery on Main Street. Crystal Palace right here. I like that. That's pretty neat. Am I looking for something in particular? No, just in general. The opening of Living Seas about it being in Russia. Oh, yeah. Everyone's rushing to see it. Where was this hanging at? You don't know? You think it's a real thing or just like a fan-made thing? It's real. Is that supposed to be Gorbachov? I don't have any history. I think that's supposed to be Gorbachov. We don't have any history on it. I mean, it's definitely back in the Epcot Center, guys. Wow. Yeah, I've never seen this. Walt Disney World brings you living seas. The sixth largest ocean in the world.

Years later, they added used only at Disneyland and Disney World, but this is a rare one that could only be used at Disneyland. 1987, later in ' 87, they uh they added the Disney World onto it. But this is this is a rare one that was only used at Disneyland. Pretty cool. I'm getting these three items. Bought a few things. Got to get out of here. The storm is a brewin. It is thundering out here. I think I saw some lightning. All right, back over into Celebration now. It is kind of nasty weather out and raining. Going to Chick-fil-A.

So, it's like their standard lemonade but on steroids. Oh, okay. Steroid lemonade. Is it a Is it a beautiful thing? You're like the Chick-fil-A guy.

W-XeHTcq6Sw,62098,4409,100,the extent of my Sunday reset 🤪 #cleaning #cleanwithme #vlog #mom #pregnant #toddlermom #vlogs,20250518,"This is a very realistic current state of my house as a mom that is 20 weeks pregnant with a three-year-old toddler. I'm solo parenting while his dad is out golfing today. So, I just let him do whatever he wanted basically. And his favorite thing is to bring his outside toys inside, which drives me a little bit crazy. But, I am 20 weeks pregnant and I like to relax on Sundays because I work full-time and tomorrow is Monday, which means tomorrow it is back to the work week. So, I'm just trying to relax and just let my toddler run rampant. We did stay inside all morning, so I'm hoping to take him outside after his nap time. So, hopefully this house stays pretty clean. Deacon will be a little over 3 and 1/2 by the time this baby arrives. And I'm wondering if he's still going to be napping by then. But honestly, I can't complain because I have a three-year-old that pretty much naps every single day, which is like a unicorn. But I am just going to cross my fingers that he is still taking naps by the time the baby gets here. Also, I might be a little bit of a unicorn myself because I do not mind whenever my fiance goes golfing on the weekend. He doesn't go very often, and I honestly don't mind having that one-on-one time with Deacon on the weekend. Now, will that change when I have two kids? Possibly, but right now, I don't care. The kitchen and living rooms were pretty much the extent of my cleaning on this Sunday because I am tired.",0.028,0.814,0.159,0.9923

That was the first interview of the day and I actually prefer that because I feel like going first or last is just my favorite times to go. But anyways, now I'm having breakfast at my desk and I'm just doing a little bit more review. I'm looking at pharmarmacology now and I should be making an cards, but I'm thinking I'll just do that on my one day a week that I have completely free. So yeah, that's what I'm doing now.

So, I'm right by the front door, and honestly, this spot is so cute. I've never sat here. And I am filming one and a half slide decks, monkey cards, like making them. And it's been around 3 and 1/2 hours. So, I might go home. But yeah. [Music] Okay, you guys, I am back from Midnight Run and I just made dinner and it's time for my treat of the day, which Garbo and Anley actually sent me. They sent me a massive slice of carrot cake, which is my favorite cake flavor. And I'm just going to have some of this while I prepare for my lab tomorrow. Cheers. M. So good. M. And it actually came with some ice cream. This is so per Why does it kind of look like mashed potatoes? Tomorrow's lab is graded. There are two activities that I just want to read up on. That way I can actually get the most out of lab when I'm there. And earlier at midnight run, I think I made like 140 cards for the two lecture topics that we had on diabetes earlier this week. Good morning, guys. It's a new day. That's why my hair looks crazy. I have a few updates for you. I totally bombed one of my interviews. Quite illprepared or just not cut out for the kind of job it was, which I already knew. But that's why I was surprised that I even got the interview. But it still would have been amazing experience and I would have loved to have worked there, but I just know I'm not the perfect candidate. So, normally I would say that I interview pretty well. I feel like I'm just used to talking a lot, like being a yapper essentially. And then I have two interviews tomorrow that I'm going to do a whole lot of prep for. And then I have one on Friday. And I really want the one that's tomorrow in the morning. So, cross your fingers and manifest for me. Today, I think I'm just going to keep it simple. I'm not even going to do my makeup because I'm going to be logging in at a new cafe that I heard about. And before I run out to meet a classmate, I want to give a huge shout out to XTiles for sponsoring this portion of the video. If you haven't heard of XTiles before, it is a userfriendly, fully customizable digital planner that you can use to organize any aspect of your life. This is what XTile looks like when you first sign up. I think this first layout is super clean and helpful if you're a visual learner like myself or a genuine beginner to digital planning or if you're indecisive on how to organize things like me. me. That's why I have so many unused stickers. I have sticker placement anxiety. But this is what a planner can look like for pharmacy school. It's how I've customized the X tiles for now. And each view you can customize or just use a pre-made template. And so I built a monthly view. It's super easy. You can drag to create a tile. You can customize any title, style, or color. And if you don't know where to start, XTiles has so many templates for you to choose from. And there are templates for so many different things. Study routines, book trackers, journals, vision boards, etc. So, for my weekly view, I just went with the student weekly planner template because obviously my classes are fixed week to week. And I like that there is an hourly schedule right now. If you want to start digital planning but don't know where to start, then I recommend XTiles. So, you can try XTiles for yourself at the link in the description box below. Do you guys want to see my type A necessities pouch? Because I laid it all out so cute. This is everything laid out perfectly. I have my tech things across the top. So, mini camera, USBC charger that works for literally every single one of my devices, wired headphones, and then a lens protector for this big camera that I'm holding right now. I have my wallet. So many different lip products. You definitely don't need this many. Honestly, I usually just have this one in here, but since I've been wearing makeup lately for interviews, I have these road lip products and this two-tier stain that I love that just brings some color back into my lips. And then this is my super important med corner. Should always have a tampon and a band-aid. I obviously have the lactate because I'm lactose intolerant. I have Advil. And this is just a fob for the pharmacy campus. I also forgot that I have this hair tie. I always have a hair tie on me just in case. You never know when you'll want your hair out of your face if you're either eating something or if you really want to like focus or if it's just like bothering you. And yeah, literally every single thing fits in here. And now I'm going to head out to study at the cafe. [Music] So Liz and I have been at Holly's cafe spot for the last like 5 6 hours and we've just been working on therapeutics like one of the lectures and learning about the doses for certain medications and it is honestly so much. I don't know how we're ever going to learn all of it or I don't know how I'm going to learn all of it. It's actually funny cuz we both use GoodNotes. These are what our summary sheets kind of look like. Very different, but like still I have the stuff that we need to memorize crossed out so I can test myself. And then I'm just like it's like the sticker function. I am the biggest creature of habit. And so tonight we're making pasta salad because it's also easy to just make a huge batch and meal prep throughout the week. So let's get prepping. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Okay. And actually, contrary to popular belief, I feel like I always see you guys asking, ""How do I study all day?"" But I do take a lot of breaks. I would say every 90 minutes to 2 hours I'll take like a 20 to 30 minute break. And when I eat I either read, call my friends or family or I watch Netflix. And recently I binged the entire fourth season of you because I heard the fifth season, the final season is really good. And so I needed to get caught up and I'm starting the fifth season now. So I'm going to eat and I'm going to watch my show and then we'll get back to studying tonight. [Music] Sh. Hey. Hey. Hi guys, happy Friday. I've already started my makeup clearly just because I wasn't going to film cuz I am so tired clearly. Obviously, I took you guys through this week and you've seen what I'm up to. But yesterday was a big day because I had two interviews before 11:00 a.m. and then I had a 3-hour class and then I came home and I studied for 5 hours. Then today was an early day as well. And I just feel like not my social battery, but I just feel like I have done so much talking this week and especially talking about myself because I had seven interviews this week. Anyways, I hope this is not coming off as complaining cuz I'm super grateful for all the opportunities I had to interview. Out of all the interviews that I've done so far, truly tanked one, but one of the ones yesterday were also not that great. I'm actually really disappointed in my responses. But anyways, I'm excited for this upcoming one. It's in like 10 minutes, but I'm almost done getting ready [Music] anyways. I just changed into this brown top that I have and my interview's in 2 minutes. So, I'm literally going to walk over into the office right here and take this interview. And usually what I do right before an interview, I usually pull up the job posting and the cover letter and the resume that I submitted because I curate both of those obviously towards the job posting. and then I can like reference that. And I always speak with wired earbuds cuz I feel like the mic on this is always better than wireless headphones no matter what it is. I'm going to join my interview. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hi Hey guys, good morning. It is quite early. I've already made my matcha and packed my bag because I'm headed out to the library. My first midterm back to pharmacy is in just less than a week. And today's a perfect study day. It's a little gloomy. It's a little rainy. And so I just kind of want to hole up at the library. So without further ado, let's head to the library. [Music] So she got my jigction. [Music] It's a baby. Oh, booms on a T when I'm not out. Yeah. Uh-huh. Booms on the T when I'm not out. Yeah. Booms on the Yeah. Uh-huh. On the note. [Music] [Music] looks really good, but also my hair is tied back, so I look like a boy. But I just finished studying for the last like 90 minutes, 2 hours. I could took a few breaks, but I just studied the lecture for type 1 diabetes therapeutics and then also reviewed them in cardboard for like the space repetition because that's mostly how I'm studying for this midterm. Now I'm moving on to take a small break and make cards for pharmarmacology and making the cards also helps me review. So yeah, I I look so bald right now. This is like not even funny. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Okay, I am officially out of here. It is 8:26 p.m. and I'm just I'm tired. I am so overstudying. I have done a lot of cards, though, both on Quizlet and on AI. And I finished most of my to-do list. I'm probably going to do a little bit more studying in bed after I like shower and like refresh. But yeah, it's a good study sesh. [Music] Guys, I literally just got home from class and hanging out and this is waiting for me at my door. What? But these are so beautiful. Oh my gosh. I was not expecting these at all. I have no idea who these are from. What? Oh my goodness. Stop. This is so sweet. The best girlfriends in the world. Okay. Thank you. [Music]",0.025,0.795,0.18,0.9999
HWgMaNtrvys,90038,3529,210,"INTENSE study vlog👩🏻‍💻: 10 hr study days, effective note taking, life as an academic weapon",20250515,"[Music] Don't overcook. [Music] [Music] [Music] Come as well. It's exactly half 5. That's so satisfying. My sister's sleeping in my room upstairs. We had a guest stay over last night, so they took my sister's room and then my sister came to stay with me. I start my neurology placement today. So, I have a few classes scheduled for throughout the day. I want to do some studying this morning, but I didn't want to wake my sister up. So, I think I'm going to go into uni to do my studying. I love leaving my house early. The streets are empty. There are no pedestrians, so I can just swing my camera wherever I like and no one cares. I need to be self-conscious when there's no one existing. My outfit's kind of crazy. Why am I wearing a whole trench coat with a backpack? This is like Dora the Explorer meets Peaky Blinders. Like what is going on? The last time I went to the clinic, the consultant told me off for wearing jeans and a t-shirt. He was like, ""Do you usually dress like that?"" And then the girl that I was on placement with, she was lowkey roasting me for my outfit. I got embarrassed, so I dressed kind of formal today. [Music] I came to 250 because I realized that I library is going to be closed at this time and I kind of didn't want to go to the student center cuz I feel like it's going to be busy cuz student center is always busy for no reason. So, I'm hoping that the student hub is going to be empty. Level five. Fingers crossed. There's no one in the kitchen. That's a good sign. It looks empty. Amazing. I made the right judgment call today. It's an empty room. [Music] Okay, guys. We have officially come across our first hurdle of the day. We were given this practice exam to do that we had to complete by 5:00 p.m. today. Originally, I was going to do it last night, but when I logged onto the exam, I realized it was 50 questions long, and I just didn't have the time to do it. So, I told myself I would just postpone it to this morning. But they've locked me out the exam cuz I already opened it once. I need to get them to unlock it for me so I can sit the exam. So I'm emailing them now because if you don't sit the exam, you get a penalty and I can't afford to have that. The office opens at 9:00 today. So worst comes to worse, I can always bring my iPad to their office, but I don't want to have to do that. I have like 3 hours to do it, but I can't get into it. That's the problem. It's okay. I'm going to practice some stoicism and just tell myself it's okay. I just sent the email. I'm hoping that they get back to me, but I really doubt that that's going to happen. So, I'm going to switch up my schedule a little bit and I'm just going to do some studying before my neurotutorials today. I have an induction lecture. I have a dementia master class. And then I have some teaching on acute neurology later on in the evening. So, I think if I get all of the prep for those classes done now, I won't have to do too much in between classes. So, I'll be able to find a nice pocket of time for me to sit and do the practice exam before 5:00 p.m. You know what? Sometimes things don't go to plan, and that's okay. I'm going to do some notes for Nuro. Do you guys want a notion tour? Should I give you a notion tour? It's very basic. This is a template by Sabyang. It's perfect. I don't know how she created such perfection, but it is everything. This one's a 10 out of 10. You can't even see the widgets that I put in because the Wi-Fi in this building is literally the worst Wi-Fi known to man. And I always forget that for some reason. I always think, oh, you know, I'll go to the student hub because this floor, great view, got like sunlight coming in, no sunlight right now because we're in London. I always forget somehow that the Wi-Fi in this room is so bad. Why did I come in if I was just going to yap? I've done nothing productive so far. Let me sit and lock in now. I'm gonna put you guys far away from me so I can't talk to you. So distracting. God, how's this? How's this [Music] view? I just finished writing up my notes on dementias. I managed to cover Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, Louis body dementia, fronttotemporal dementia. And I also touched a little bit on strokes as well. I'm going to keep the momentum going and do some past med. I think I'm just going to bang out a load of questions. Now, let's begin. I'm on a dopamine high right now, guys. This is like my favorite thing to do in the world. Pass med. [Music] I'm on my way to the examination office now. Afterwards, I huttle to Queen Square to go to my first class. I didn't even know that Queen Square was so far away. It's saying it's going to be like a 20minut walk to get there. I think I can do it in [Music] 10. I can't find this room. I think I came in the wrong exit. Not exit, entrance. I came in the wrong I can't talk. but it's actually on the other side of the building. It's like 10 past 9 and I need to be at my class at 9:30. So, I think I'm just going to go straight there now. I also need to pee. So, I'm going to pee then go to my class and then we'll sort this out after my class cuz I don't have the capacity for this right now. All right, guys. Just be right back, guys. I don't know why I could give myself hours to be on time for something. Why am I always rushing? Let's go to class. Made it. 5 minutes to spare. Let's see who's in. Oh my god. Do you want to say hi to the vlog? Guys, this is Hera. She's my best friend. The princess. She's supposed to say hi. She complimented my hair and I said, ""I like yours, too."" Looking great. Her hair is looking great. I can vouch for it. Thank you. I have X-ray vision stickers online from AliExpress. I could just bring them in. We can we can trade stickers, you know, and the trade being just your presence. I'll cry at this. Oh, there you go. I'm recording. Hold on. Can you turn it into selfie mode? I think so. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Your camera. No, it's a Jess's vlog. We've hijacked Jess's vlog. Yeah. So, today we're starting neurology placement at the National Hospital for Neuro Neuros. I took a picture of it to send to my parents to flex on them. Where's the woman herself? Let's get an action shot. Wow. 56 seconds. Like what happened in those 56 seconds? I want to Good morning everyone. I'm Dr. Can anyone tell me why giraffes have no voice? Because of the recurren goes all the way down around me all the way down from the brain. It's about 10 m long. It's just too long for to survive. So giraffes make no noise. Good. So um so if you're an aonomous I think I can get everyone in. I need to do like a 0.5 and like it's so funny. It's a school trip. It's pretty cool. Wow. They have Overcooked. Have you played this game? But I've played that one. It's really good. Tetris. Mortal Kombat. Wow. Who who actually I don't even know. I just finished my first induction lecture to neurology and had a tour of Queens, which is where we'll be doing most of our placement. I was quite excited by the common area for students. They had a lot of games. I want to play some games with someone. I don't know who, but I'll probably go at some point and see who's there and convince them to play Overcooked with me because I love that game. Is that hot up? Hi. Our year is down there. So funny because Queen Square is ridiculously close to IOE. So all of the med students have just come to IOE to study. Usually it's literally just me in this whole building. But it's so weird that I'm seeing so many people there. You guys know that I like to review and organize my notes as soon as possible after I have lectures. So that's what I'm going to do now. I've actually started using an app called N to help me take notes during class. And I'd like to thank NTA for sponsoring this portion of the video. Not is a transcription and AI summary app that helps you take notes during class so that you don't have to. I use Not to take notes during class so that I don't have to worry about writing down everything my professors say and then I can actually focus on understanding and engaging with the content. Afterwards, I can take the generated transcript and review the lecture content a second time. Sometimes if I take notes during lectures myself, I lose focus and end up missing important information. And most of the time I can't type as fast as my professors speak. So honestly, why go through the stress when you can get an app to do it all for you? You can also use Notter in your online meetings. As a uni student, I've had to organize a lot of group project meetings. So I've used N to help me to transcribe discussions, track action items, and ultimately contribute to a more organized and productive group work experience. Make sure to download N and maximize the value of every conversation. I don't know why that lecture felt like it was unending, but I only took like two sections of notes. I really did the bare minimum for this lecture, but thankfully not had my back and generated a whole transcript for me so I can review the lecture content a second time. I can have a little read and decide for myself which are the most important points to add to my notes and then I can just fill in my notion page with all of the important information that I would need to know for my exams. I'm going to quickly fill in all of my notes for the neuro introduction and then I will be back onto sorting out my practice exam that I didn't end up taking this morning. They sent me an email during my lecture actually to tell me to come into the exam office. But I also got another email saying that my test paper had been re-uploaded. So, I'm hoping that they just refresh the whole thing and I can just sit it now. We will see. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. I'm going to focus on writing my notes now. I can only focus on one problem at a time, guys. It's rough out here to be thinking to be multitasking. Multitasking is not for me. Update. I was just kicked out of the room, but that's fine cuz I finished all my notes anyway. I'm going to go check if my practice exam has reopened or if I need to go to the exam office to get my iPad fixed. Fingers crossed. I really hope that they fixed it. It's still locked. I need to go. Okay, that's so annoying. I'm going to go to the examination office now. Let's go. Chili, garlic. Thank you. Thank you so much. That was so nice. I picked up lunch cuz I don't think I'm going to have time if I'm going to go get my iPad sorted and immediately sit my practice exam after that. I'm not sure how long that's going to take. Probably an hour and then I have to run off to my next class, which is back at Queen Square. So, that's already a 20-minute walk. You know, there just aren't enough hours in the day. [Music] I picked up a blueberry matcher from Black Street. It needs [Music] mixing. I think I'm just going to sit here for a little bit to calm myself down cuz that was a little bit of an overstimulating experience. I feel a little bit oversaturated right now and I think I need a little break from peeking. [Music] I needed [Music] that. iPad is back on track. He reset my browser and I can take the exam again. At the end, he was like, ""You've got a deadline to complete it."" And I was like, ""I am doing it right now. Don't you even worry."" He was like, ""Any issues? Come right back."" And I was like, I hope I don't have to see you again today. And he was like, ditto. Right back at you. Don't come back. It was so funny. I need to decide where I want to take this exam now. Honestly, this lecture room is looking pretty juicy. Like got a good view of Cissy and not much else. So, I could just do it here. I didn't even know that this part of the building existed. I think I'll be here more often because it looks pretty empty. So, I don't think anyone knows that it exists. I think this might be my new study spot, guys. I always getting too busy. I think I'm just going to explore this building and see if I can find an even nicer room to do the exam in and then sit and do my exam and then go to my next class and then go to my class after that next class and then I'm free for the day. I love life. Oh my god, this little terrace looks so fun. How do I even get there? That's so cute. I explored the rest of this building and all of the other floors are just labs. So, we're going to stay here. Guys, listen to this. What do I even carry with me? Bricks. You know what? I changed my mind. It's a little bit too loud here. I'm going to move somewhere [Music] [Music] quieter. It is 2:35. My lecture is at 3:00. I just complet this room. No, but I will be gone in 5 minutes. All right. [Music] [Applause] Okay, guys. We are on the move again. I'm heading to Queen Square to go for my next lecture. If you've watched my vlogs before, you'll start to notice a theme, which is that if I need to be somewhere, I will not leave until the very last second. Finally getting to eat my lunch. It was kind of mid, but the guys running the store were really lovely, which was kind of the exact opposite with Black Street because some horrible, horrible, awful people run that shop. But the coffee is really good. So of genetic causes, psychological, what is going on? It's actually really nice. You know what? It's tiny. It's very cute. It is very cute. It's like miniature. It's a vibe. Really like morbid part of me wants it. I just finished my two lectures. I'm heading to I now since it's close. I do have a project that's due next week and judging by today, I don't want to leave it last minute again. I'm going to try and get it done as soon as possible so I don't have to stress about it. [Music] Every step so golden. Oh yeah. Breathing slowly. I never thought you would open up for me. I promise I will give you the love that you want. Can you tell me the truth? I need your mind. There's no reason to choose cuz I'm falling for you, girl. Only gets better when I pull down on me. [Music]",0.049,0.808,0.143,0.9998
KeRNGPWPTqU,23311,247,152,HOW TO GET CANDY BLOSSOM (FREE) GLITCH in GROW A GARDEN! ROBLOX,20250524,"So many people have been asking me how to get the candy blossoms inside of Grow a Garden. So, in this video, I will be showing you a few ways that might actually get you some for completely free. So, as you guys all know, the candy blossom is now impossible to get since the Easter event is gone. Or is it now? The first method in getting candy blossoms that people claim to work is by joining an older server on Grow a Garden. And supposedly the Easter shop is still there. So, let's go ahead and test it out. All right, so here we are. I'm about to join an old server. And is the Easter shop still here? Time for the moment of truth. 321. And yep, it's not there. It could either be for two reasons. First, the guy on TikTok could have been lying. Or second, I wasn't in a server old enough. I'm not 100% if this works or not, but you can go ahead and test it out in your own free time. So, the next method that some people claim is that you can actually get them from Lucky Harvest. So, whenever you pick up a plant, there's a small chance that you will get a lucky harvest, which will give you the seed of the plant you picked up. This method requires already having at least one candy blossom tree. So, if you don't have it, then you can go ahead and move on to the last method. All right, so this last method to get the candy blossom is that according to the Grow a Garden wiki page, it actually randomly shows up during shop restocks. So apparently every 5 minutes when the shop restocks, there's a small chance of the candy blossom possibly being in stock for me. I've actually never seen it in stock here, but you guys should go test it out to see if it actually works or not. If none of those methods work for you, then don't worry. I'm going to be giving away a huge candy blossom of my own that sells for 10 billion shekels. If you want a chance to win, then like, subscribe, and just comment below your Roblox username. Anyways, peace out, guys.",0.005,0.874,0.121,0.993

tJ5qir3q52k,38718,843,57,Life Update with a Vlog | Best dessert for sugar cravings | Vegetable pulao,20250525,"Hi everyone. How are you all? I know it's been a very long time since I uploaded a full vlog here. To be honest, this video was taken soon after Eid and I wanted to upload it soon. A lot of other tasks had come up which I couldn't skip but I completed them to come back to editing this video. And by the time I finished all those, I forgot what was included in this video. Moreover, I was eager to take a new vlog. But then I thought to check this video out and edit it as I have taken the effort to take a video. Anyways, I'm back with vlogs, I guess, but I have a lot more coming my way. We are going on vacation next month hopefully. We have a few trips coming up which I will update soon. I have my internship which is the main intention of my vacation this time and yes more and more maybe on the way so days are going to be hectic and that's what I feel so but definitely I will be updating you all through vlogs and a few posts to be honest I was not sure of what recipes I had included in this video I barely could make out the ingredients but while editing I checked out the spice bottles I used which of course I have cut in each place but thankfully I know the ingredients now that I can share with you all. The measurements are in the description box. That was a pasta dish or I can say macaroni for breakfast as for kids tiffen as they insist on not keeping anything that would leak. Their tiffen included mostly sandwiches or some semi-liquid or dry items. I also wanted to share a few tiffen recipes with you all since I'm anyway preparing their tiffen everyday without feel. Rarely they do buy from the canteen as they don't prefer whether vihan or arman. So keeping that in mind their tiffen is always ready in the morning. Hopefully we'll share some other time soon. These days my home is totally disorganized because I get so tired organizing it every time with an infinite home who loves to clutter his space and his space is the whole house. Everything that I had kept in the best organized way is now in a place that I would have never thought it would be. Either it's on top of any cupboards that we have or it's pushed to the wall so that it's out of reach from his tiny hands. Cooking these days has become like a nightmare. Thankfully, I have someone to help me clean the home every alternate day. I try making the most easiest food I can. I usually make upma, but after I started cooking, I realized that simolina was over, so had to switch to the broken meat. This was the most time consuming thing I've had these days. It's writing my assignments. And before I started to write on the paper, I had to keep the notes ready and I did it in the notes app on my laptop so that I just had to copy them from the same on the paper. Each assignment has to be 60 pages which includes 18 questions of different lengths of answers required and this year I have four assignments to be submitted. Last year it was six and I remember I finished it in a month. At that time, Lean wasn't this active. He was just 4 months old. Even though it's less this time, it felt like I had even more to complete. Totally satisfied and happy that it's complete. Now, all I have to do is pack it in my bag while going on vacation. had a few vegetables in my fridge that day. So, prepared a veg pulao which came out good and my kids enjoyed. So, I'm sure you and your kids will do. So give it a try. I always love using my wide open clay pot for pulao or biryani that I prepare for just the four of us. And recently someone had asked me if my pots don't break. I think it was in the comment section. I'm not sure. To be honest, sometimes I wish it broke so that I could get a new one. Having one and buying again and again is something that I've stopped from a long time back and it takes up a lot of space. Finally, I'll have to end up decluttering which I don't do for my crockeries unless very much need it. So, I try to buy something only if I know I have a space for it and also it's something I can't let go of. So to a mix of coconut oil and ghee I added some whole spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, maze, whole pepper and such. Added crushed ginger and garlic. When the raw smell goes, saute onion till it's soft. I cut carrots and potatoes into small cubes and added them. You can add more veggies if you like. That's a mix of coriander. and leaves and mint leaves. I chopped it together and kept it aside. Once the potatoes and carrots are half done, add tomatoes and the mixed herbs. Add salt and mix. to have along with the veg pulao. I made meatballs as a side for my kids. Had some minced meat with me in the freezer. So I had washed and drained it. To that I added gingergarlic, green chili paste and the coriander mint leaves mix that I had left over. Then goes in black pepper powder, garam masala powder, cumin powder, bread crumbs, turmeric powder, Kashmir red chili powder and salt. Mix all together and keep that aside for some time. To this add some turmeric powder, coriander powder and garam masala powder. Mix well. Now to get a little bit of bright color and an extra taste. I added around 1 tbsp of tomato paste. This is completely optional but if you have do add mix well. I find that pula tastes really good when we add coconut milk instead of curd or plain water. So I added half coconut milk and half water. The ratio is double the amount of rice. Added washed and drained basmati rice to this. Mix well. Keep on high flame till it boils and then reduce it to the minimum. I always need to keep an eye on this tiny man who can turn dangerous sometimes. Okay. Hello. And look who is here. His favorite spot is this cabinet. In this nowadays, I don't keep anything within his reach. All the three cabinets from the bottom are empty as he takes out everything. For the last few minutes, I cover the pot with an aluminum foil so that the steam doesn't go out and the rice becomes soft. Hold on. I was feeling super hungry. So, as soon as I gave Lyanna a shower and fed him his lunch, I think it was breakfast, not lunch. I had my lunch just before kids were back from school. I fried the meatballs in air fryer. And trust me, meatballs turn out really well when done in air fryer. Happy birthday. I made a simple gravy for the meatballs, but it wasn't as great as expected and even kids were not enjoying it much. So that's why I have skipped that part here. Just the meatballs were enough for them. I had shared on my Instagram story about a healthy item that I make most of the time, especially when I crave something sweet and chocolaty. It happens mostly a few days before my periods. You must be knowing if you have been watching me from some time. I have been following ATP or I have been in ATP ever since I did a transformation video. I only took a break when I was pregnant with Lean and I still follow their guidelines of diet with the help of a nutritionist that they have. She had sent me a recipe for sugar cravings. I could make that but I simply made a modification and here's what I do. three dates roughly tone in pieces. Added a few pistachios. You can go for any nuts. Added a teaspoon of peanut butter because I love the peanut taste. And this is without sugar one. Then half a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder. Around 2 tesp of oats, which is again optional. A glug of milk. You can also add hot water instead of milk. I forgot to add another one of my favorites. adds a little bit of tahini. Now mix this and microwave for a minute and the dessert is done. I would suggest having only this much quantity though you will crave for more especially if you're dieting but ask your dietician before having it. standing. I had tried to sit on my assignment works whenever possible because I had to finish it at any cost. So that was a very simple and normal day vlog I had shot after Eid. We'll come up with more updates and snippets. I'm not sure what my next content will be as I'm nearing the date for leaving for vacation. So, days are going to be hectic with shopping, packing, organizing. I'll try my level best to come back soon. Until then, take care everyone. Bye-bye.",0.037,0.849,0.114,0.9992
gVRnu_io7VE,27150,0,0,"Daily Mass Saturday, May 24, 2025",20250524,"Thank you for joining us for today's mass. And now we join our celebrant, Father Jack Schaefer, and our server, seminarian Michael Isoma. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. Have mercy on us, O Lord, for we have sinned against you. Show us, O Lord, your mercy and grant us your salvation. May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Amen. Let us pray. Almighty and eternal God, who through the regenerating power of baptism have been pleased to confer on us heavenly life, grant we pray that those you render capable of immortality by justifying them may by your guidance attain the fullness of glory through our Lord Jesus Christ, your son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever. Amen. A reading from the Acts of the Apostles. Paul reached also Derby and Lystra, where there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek. The brothers in Lystra and Iconium spoke highly of him, and Paul wanted him to come along with him. On account of the Jews of that region, Paul had him circumcised, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. As they traveled from city to city, they handed on to the people for observance. The decisions reached by the apostles and prespits in Jerusalem. Day after day, the churches grew stronger in faith and increased in number. They traveled through Friian and Galatian territory because they had been prevented by the Holy Spirit from preaching the message in the province of Asia. When they came to Messia, they tried to go onto Bethnia, but the spirit of Jesus did not allow them. So they crossed through Messia and came down to Trrowaz. During the night, Paul had a vision. A Macedonian stood before him and implored him with these words. Come over to Macedonia and help us. When he had seen the vision, we sought passage to Macedonia at once, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Let all the earth cry out to God with joy. Let all the earth cry out to God with joy. Sing joyfully to the Lord, all you lands. Serve the Lord with gladness. Come before him with joyful song. Let all the earth cry out to God with joy. Know that the Lord is God. He made us his. We are his people, the flock he tends. Let all the earth cry out to God with joy. The Lord is good. His kindness endures forever and his faithfulness to all generations. Let all the earth cry out to God with joy. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to John. Glory to you, O Lord. Jesus said to his disciples, ""If the world hates you, realize that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own. But because you do not belong to the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, the world hates you. Remember the word I spoke to you, no slave is greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. And they will do all things to you on account of my name. But they do not know the one who sent me. The Gospel of the Lord. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus predicted many things, including the world's animosity toward him and his followers. All four gospels emphasized that Jesus understood the hostility that he and his disciples would encounter. He said, ""No slave is greater than his master."" And this statement carries profound implications. In today's gospel, he explained that if the world is hostile toward the master, the servants should explain expect rather the same treatment. This also means that if the master humbled himself to wash the feet of his servants, they should be prepared to do the same for others, exemplifying humility and servitude. Jesus' statement, ""No slave is greater than his master,"" encourages us to reflect deeply on our relationship with him. It highlights our dependence on the Holy Spirit to model our lives after that of Jesus. And now we pray to the father our all powerful God who raised Jesus our savior from death that the church may be eager to spread the good news of Christ going wherever the spirit of Jesus leads us. We pray to the Lord. Lord here our prayer. Jesus taught us to love our enemies. So let us pray for the conversion of those who persecute the church. May they be overcome not by violence but by love. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. Recognizing that the servant is not greater than the master. May we be given the strength not only to believe in Christ but to suffer for him as well. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer for those who have died and gone before us in the faith of Christ in a special way. Today we remember Mark F. Francado. We pray to the Lord. Lord, here our prayer for the homebound and the sick, for those who care for them, and for all those intentions we now offer from the silence of our hearts. For these we pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. Father in your mercy, grant us all for which we ask with faith and devotion through Christ our Lord. Amen. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands. It will become for us the bread of life. Blessed be God forever. Thank you. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands. It will become our spiritual drink. Blessed be God forever. with contra. Lord, wash away my iniquity and cleanse me from all my sins. Thank you. Pray brothers and sisters that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father. May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his holy church. Accept in compassion, Lord, we pray, the offerings of your family, that under your protective care, they may never lose what they have received, but attain the gifts that are eternal. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. Lift up your hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is right and just. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation at all times to acclaim you, oh Lord, but in this time above all to lod you yet more gloriously when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. For with the old order destroyed, a universe cast down is renewed and integrity of life is restored to us in Christ. Therefore, overcome with pascal joy, every land, every people exalts in your praise, and even the heavenly powers with the angelic hosts sing together the unending hym of your glory as they acclaim, ""Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosana in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosana in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, the f of all holiness. Make holy, therefore, these gifts we pray by sending down your spirit upon them like the dwfall so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving thanks, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, ""Take this all of you and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you. In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice and once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples saying, ""Take this all of you and drink from it. For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world. For by your cross and resurrection, you have set us free. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity. Together with Leo our pope and William our bishop and all the clergy. Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all. We pray that with the blessed virgin Mary, mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be co-airs to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your son Jesus Christ. Through him and with him and in him, oh God, almighty father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen. At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our savior Jesus Christ. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, ""Peace I leave you. My peace I give you. Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will. Who live and reign forever and ever. Amen. The peace of the Lord be with you always. Your spirit. Peace with you. Thanks. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace. Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. For those who cannot join us in person and receive the eukarist, we now offer this act of spiritual communion. My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the most holy sacrament. I love you above all things and I desire to receive you into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace you as if you were already there and unite myself h wholly to you. Never permit me to be separated from you. Amen. Let us pray. Keep safe, O Lord, we pray, those whom you have saved by your kindness, that redeemed by the passion of your son, they may rejoice in his resurrection, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. May almighty God bless you. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. The mass has ended. Go in peace. Thanks be to God.",0.06,0.668,0.271,1.0
32ZF7cNAXFY,16540,2619,369,Our Inseparable Relationship – Daily Devotional,20250523,"[Music] Here's today's InTouch devotion. Today's scripture reading is Romans 8:es 31-39. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not spare his own son, but delivered him over for us all, how will he not also with him freely give us all things? Who will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who justifies. Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is he who died. Yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us. Who will separate us from the love of Christ? will tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword. Just as it is written, for your sake we are being put to death all day long. We were considered as sheep to be slaughtered. But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. God is love. His nature requires that he love his creation unconditionally. This means that no matter what we do, he will not stop caring about us. After hearing that sentence, many people are going to think of reasons why they are an exception. So, let's be clear. God has deep love for each and every one of us. And the only thing preventing us from experiencing it is our response. Romans 8:31 tells us God is on the side of the believer. In order for us to be purified and enter into relationship with him, he gave up his son to death. Jesus sacrifice itself is proof of God's love. But there are many additional expressions of his care for us. The Lord has a purpose and plan for every one of his children. Through his sovereign control, he works every situation, good and bad, to our benefit. He is a loving father who not only is interested in what happens to us but also is actively involved in our daily life. Some people read and intellectually believe every word of the Bible but still feel unloved because they judge themselves unworthy. Their doubt acts like a dam. The barrier will hold as long as the person believes God's love must be deserved or earned. But thankfully, our father is patient and freely gives his love to us as we work to understand the truth.",0.099,0.666,0.235,0.998
proGYT1T8gY,29900,2085,400,Does Daily Driving a Jeep Wrangler SUCK?,20250523,"What's up? It's Mary. I only know that it's notoriously bad on road, Tommy. Is that right? That's right, Mary. Yeah. But I'm going to try to take it through like a few categories to see what really determines a car being good on road or not. And then I'm going to try not to to give it too much of a hard time with that, but I have a feeling it won't pass my test. I've got the keys right here. So, I'm going to give them to Mary. Good lord, Tommy. So, I'll take it for a week. Awesome. So, the Jeep Wrangler Sport, baby. TFL bought this for $33,000 and they started calling it the last cheap Jeep. And you know, 33 is actually below the average car price in the market right now. I think the average is around 45 to 50. So, insane. But Jeeps have the reputation for being remarkably bad onroad. Everybody knows a Jeep is good off-road. That's typically why you buy them. But this video is going to journey through six different chapters analyzing, checking out, reviewing the things that I think make a car, you know, quote unquote good on road, and we'll see if it stacks up. This Jeep's name is Bill. Uh, it's been on plenty of adventures, plenty of off-road journeys. Its uh debut off-road was actually on Kelly Flats in Fort Collins, Colorado, which is extraordinarily treacherous. And they did it in the stock tires. Like they had not done anything to it. So since then, it has new tires and to be honest with you, it's just made it a lot louder onroad, but it succeeded a little bit more off-road after that. But anyway, we'll get into all that in a minute. But basically, I'm going to take you through six chapters. One, noise. A car on road should not deafen you. Number two, comfort. How snug as a  rug really are you when you're in this thing? And how long would you want to be sitting in it before you want to scream? Three, steering. How smooth like butter is that steerage? Steerage. Four, practicality. How easy is it to live with, right? Does it make sense? Do the mechanics of the car fill you with joy, with ease, with sparkly delight? Five, safety. Do you feel safe driving it? And six, vibes. What character from a novel or movie or any piece of media do you feel like when you're riding when you're driving a Jeep? Different brands mean different things to different people. So, we're going to delve into all of that and you're going to come with me whether you like it or not. Although the truth is you can click out of this video whenever you want. I wish you wouldn't because I hope I hope you're with me for the long haul on this journey. But hey, it's your life, baby. Do with it what you will. But I hope you stay with me. Let's go. Good morning. We're in the Jeep still. And I got to say, I feel tall. I feel fabulous. I feel a little uncomfortable. Okay, it is loud. Oh my god, it's loud. The road noise is kind of insane. Now, look, there's a lot of reasons for that as I'm learning. One, this comes off. So, there's, you know, there's too many unfilled seams in this car that a normal car would have that would be closed up. So, makes sense why it is that way. But that's one reason why we are accosted by the wind. Number two, there is a lack of what is called deadening or as a houser would put it, hower, as a person who builds houses would put it, insulation. In a normal car, there is what's called deadening in like the sides and the top of the car, which is essentially just like material to make it a little bit quieter. the Jeep, none. 0% deadening. So, that's another reason it's so loud. But one of the biggest reasons is because of these off-road tires we have on here, which have giant tread or lugs. Lugs is crazy. I kind of love that word, but I also kind of hate it. So, if we want to get super technical about it, the Jeep Wrangler Sport is up high on what is called NVH, which is noise, vibration, and harshness. noise, as I've established, loud. Vibration, pretty rough because of those treaded tires. And harshness, I don't really know how you determine the harshness necessarily, but it is also pretty harsh. So, now you know what NVH means. Tommy told me about it, and he's like, ""What do you think MVH stands for?"" And I was like, ""Not very hot."" Now, listen. Is that noise pleasant? No. Is it get overable? Maybe. If you get super overstimulated super easily, I would not recommend the Jeep Wrangler Sport because you just you're you're attacked on all sides. Your body feels like it's kind of like you can I can hear the wind to the west. I can hear the wind to the east. I can feel the wind coming down. Not really. I can't feel it coming down or up, but it's loud. So, noise. Does this Jeep pass the noise test for being good on road? No. Duh. does not. So, category one, noise. I'm actually gonna edit in that sound and that symbol. A really noisy vehicle on road is obviously uncomfortable. So, let's get into comfort. And actually, I've employed help to talk about comfort with the one and only. Hi, Jennifer Benstein. Mary. Jenna, I have a question. Yes. Do you like the Rolling Stones? I'd never be your beast of burden. I walk for miles. My feet are hurt. Never never never never be. Never heard of them. Yeah, I haven't either. Okay, Jen, I have invited you on my comfort section. And you chose the Jeep. I chose the Jeep for comfort. Well, it what? Let me let it be very well known that I never pick the cars that I drive. Okay, fair. I'm just told what to drive and I drive them. Is there any comfort in the Jeep? Such a good question. Because no, the seats kind of feel like they just forgot to design them. Yeah. Like or they forgot to finish designing them, right? Like they they put the back and the the like the bottom part and they said that looks like a seat to me. I think Yeah, I think they look cool like with the uh the stitching and the cloth and then it kind of ends there. I agree wholeheartedly. It's just And it's just stiff, man. I'm trying to figure out just how to adjust my seat. Oh, honey, it's manual. I know. I'm just trying to figure out Well, like the the seat back. Oh, that's on your upper right shoulder. There it is. That's convenient. Yeah, it's nice, right? I I did that when I was driving. Is that legal? Yeah, cuz that's how they made it. Shouldn't be. Can't text on your phone, nor should you, but this is totally fine. Something else that determines comfort. Mhm. Is road quality, right? Yes. Quality. Ride quality. Ride quality on the road. And also the quality of the road will also be a factor. So not awesome. No, but you know what I've noticed is whenever I go over like a pothole or railroad tracks or anything like that or you know big obstacles in the road, it's very floaty. Like I do not feel like I'm being jostled a boot. Exactly. The suspension and the tires are designed for bigger obstacles. A little bit of a softer landing. Yeah. I just think it absorbs bigger like obstacles better. And that's because it's literally designed to do that because it has those coil springs. Mhm. But honestly, Jennifer, my biggest gripe with comfort in this car is not where you and I are sitting. Oh. The back seat is not for the faint of heart or the long of leg or the desirer of comfort. Oh, that's that's a All right. So that was just down athletic on my part. Okay. So that's if the driver is approximately 4 feet tall. Mary, do you want me to adjust my feet back? Okay. So this is if like somebody like Andre or the way back driving. Um and let me just say there's about millimeter of leg room back here. You actually have some a little I mean if I'm really pressed over here, but then small. It is not designed for the people who sit back here. does have cup holders. Vents and cup holders. So, luxurious. Um, try again. Okay. Adequate. Closer. Bad. It's bad. Okay. It's bad. It's bad. That's That's pretty. Also, I mean, to be honest, I just I don't like two doors. Dismount. Gracious. Lovely. Now, there's a word I want everyone to think about right now, and that word is stiff. Okay. St. F. Wow, my hair is nuts. Hold on one sec. Now, stiff is such a versatile word. There's so many different ways you can use it. I mean, you can have stiff joints. You can have a stiff drink. You can have stiff competition. A dead person is called a stiff. You can put on a sweater and say, ""This fabric's kind of stiff."" You can go outside and you say, ""Ah, that's a stiff breeze."" The possibilities are kind of endless with that word, but where I want to apply it is in stiff steering. Okay, the steering is stiff. It's kind of supposed to be because in off-roading situations, you want to have a lot of control. So, a steering wheel like this isn't going to snap back at you. It's It's going to go where you want it to go. It's recirculating ball steering with a solid front axle. So, it's not what, you know, someone might call precise. They really got to crank it to get it to turn, which again in off-roading scenarios is a good thing. So, the steering is stiff. Is the rest of the car really that practical? My verdict is no, it is not. It is not practical at all, guys. And I will start with the most obvious, which is that it has a manual fob. Here it is. Check around. Which makes you feel cool. But honestly, I've lived with a manual fob my whole life, so this is like nothing new. Uh, but it is just weird, I think, at the end of the day. I locked it. But that's not where the manual operations end. Before you ask, no, it is not a manual. It doesn't have a manual transmission. It's automatic. Although, this does kind of look like a manual transmission. Or this one does, but it also has, check it out, manual windows. It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen. It's not where it ends. It also has manual mirrors. You guys, come here. I have never been so confused as to what I actually need in terms of visibility as when I've needed to adjust the mirrors like this and be like, ""Okay, I'm going to push it in just a tad. That feels good."" But I don't know how it looks from the driver's seat yet. So, I'm going to slink on back. That's super wrong. It's closer. It's literally just tiny micro adjustments. I think that's good. This one's obviously easier cuz it's much closer and there's not there's not as much acrobatics involved. So, that's where most of the manual things end. Like manual seats as we saw earlier with Jen. The last impractical thing, my friends, is as follows. It's the ass. This is also a manual lock. So, you have three doors to lock if you want to stay unrobed. But, I mean, look at the room back here. Or the lack thereof, I guess. Dismal. There's no way anything can not not anything like worth bringing could sit back here. And then the final category, which I have brought Tommy on board for because he knows more about it than me, is safety. Tommy, a lot of people claim that it's bad on road because it's not super safe on. Yeah, Mary, that's a great point. Now, we'll talk about airbags, the big inflatable things that keep you safe in an accident. I've heard of those. You have Jeeps for a long time only had two, whereas a lot of modern cars had six, seven, eight. Plus, this one has more than two. It's got front airbags. It also has these guys over here, side curtain, so in a collision. So they are upping their safety with airbags, which is good. But they're still really behind on some stuff like, have you tried the headlights on this Jeep at night? No. I try to avoid driving this at night at all costs. Oh my gosh. It's not that dangerous. Well, it does have headlights, but they are extremely poor. They're like they're old style incandescent headlights, which are kind of like gloworms in a snowstorm. Oh, very poetic. Thank you. working on it. They just don't make a lot of light. Uh and then you've got stuff like it doesn't have blind spot monitoring, you know, like a lot of new cars. Yeah. And the since you have to get out to adjust the mirror, it's not very safe in that way either. Yeah. Right. And it doesn't passenger. It doesn't have like a lot of like the cross cross traffic alert detection. So, it's missing a lot of like the technology that would make it more safe in a modern car. But Mary, I think a lot of Jeep people kind of like that cuz they like a more stripped down vehicle. I mean, I guess if you like less safety, sure. One thing that I feel like is really kind of not not or it's not aligned with the rest of it is a beautiful backup camera. Yes. The clearest thing I've ever seen. It's like we're going to stay in the 1940s for the majority of this car, but welcome to 2025 when you hit reverse. And that's like the weird part about this car, right? It's like I mean, it's got no power, anything. Yeah, that's crazy. Um, but then it's got this huge screen, right, which looks really good. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of a weird weird mix of things. Case said it's a giant screen in a car with otherwise no features. That's really true. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly right. And then like other safety things, um, I'm sure you've talked about this already in this video, but steering. Stiff. Stiff. Not precise. Not precise. Also great for off-roading, pretty bad for on-roading. Yeah. Yeah. And the reason it's so good for off-roading is like if you hit a rock with a lot of modern steering, the wheel will whip out of your hand and that can actually hurt yourself. This is so old style and slow. It's called recirculating ball. Just kind of rolls over stuff and doesn't get a lot of that feedback. Mhm. I talked about that. Did you? I knew about that. Wow. I listened to you guys and you talk. Isn't that crazy? That is crazy. And then the other thing too about this Jeep which kind of adds to maybe or subtracts from the safety aspect is it's got a really short wheelbase. So the front and the rear wheels are really close together, right? And that means that it's a little bit less stable over some of the bumps. Have you felt that? Like it gets a little wobbly at a at a moment. Yeah, I said to Jen that the big bumps feel like no problem and the little bumps feel like a big problem. That's a great point. Yeah, I like that. Yeah, the little bumps are the problem. And that's because you got these two beam axles which are fighting each other. Mhm. W Look at you and all your new knowledge. I know. I'm learning so much. I do. I do like it. But honestly, that brings me to my last point because I don't I don't love the mechanics of it or you know how they forgot to like bake in comfort. But I do love the vibes of this car. The vibes. Now, when I say the vibes, what do I mean? I mean like what is the thing that offsets all the things that make it kind of uncomfortable on road? And that is the Jeep community. You know, people are just hardcore Jeep people. The Jeep people are like, ""We're Jeeps."" Wow. And I know I'm a little bit of an imposter cuz I do not own this Jeep, but I want to be a part of that even even just for a second. But what I mean by the vibes is you can take the top off. You can cruise on the coast. You can feel like the main character in a movie. And honestly, that's how I felt driving this this week cuz I'm up high. People are looking cuz it's that cool blue color. It doesn't always have to be blue, but you know what I mean. It's just fun. The vibes are fun. Does it make perfect sense to get as your daily driver? No, it does not. It does not make sense to get as your daily driver. If you have the means to get two vehicles, one as an off-roader and one as an on-roader, get the Jeep as the off-roader. It's so fun. It's so cool. You're part of an awesome community. But if you can only get one vehicle that you're going to use as your off-roader and your on-roader, just get the 4Runner. The 4Runner does a lot better on road. It's a lot smoother, but it's not as fun. I will admit it's not as fun. I also know I usually do history, but to be honest, Tommy did an amazing video right here. Go watch this because it does an sensational job of describing the Jeep history and it's way better a job than I could ever do. So, just watch that video cuz you'll get more out of it than just listen to me. Yep. So, the conclusion, my friends, what I think the Jeep Wrangler onroad is like, it's like if LeBron James decided to become a ballerina, he has all the right body parts for it. He's strong enough. He is an athlete, but he is designed, his body is designed for intense physical contact. And so, if he tries to do ballet, he just won't look as smooth with it. He'll still be able to do it cuz he's LeBron James and he's he's a pretty hardcore dedicated guy. So, if he put his mind to it, he could do it, but he wouldn't look as smooth as a trained ballerina who has the body type for it. In that scenario, obviously ballet is onroad. Basketball is off-roading. That intense physical contact with a lot of how you say obstacles. So, the Jeep Wrangler, Bill, Bill, the little Jeep Wrangler Sport onroad is like LeBron James doing ballet. Tell me if you think that's a decent comparison. I think it's pretty good. After driving this for about a week, I'm like, ""Yeah, it does what it's supposed to do on road. It gets you from A to B, but it doesn't do it with any sort of finesse."" However, as I said, Bill's been on a bunch of off-road adventures, and he does do that with finesse. So, it's all give and take, just like everything in this life. So, thank you so much for joining me on this jy journey. May you be silly and thrive. And if you made it this far, thank you so much. Bye. Who's calling me? Oh, Zack. All right. Nope. Oh, that makes a very unsatisfying sound. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I like being passenger princess. I've never think of all the things I can do. I can do this. All the things I can do.",0.06,0.747,0.193,1.0
-uwcXrgJ_eo,40062,833,153,Donkey Kong's New Redesign Explained by Shigeru Miyamoto - IGN Daily Fix,20250521,"What is up everybody? Max here and in today's news, Chagarro Miiamoto reveals why Nintendo gave Donkey Kong a makeover and Microsoft announces some new games coming to Game Pass later this month, as well as a retro classics library that will be adding a bunch of really old ones to the service as well. Let's get into [Music] it. There's been much debate in the Nintendo community about Donkey Kong's new look. He was given a noticeable redesign for the Super Mario Brothers movie, and a lot of fans were surprised to see this look carry over for his upcoming video game appearances in Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bonanza. And now, Donkey Kong creator Chagarro Miiamoto has weighed in on the controversial matter. Speaking to IGN, the legendary game designer reflected on how the character's design has changed since his first appearance, saying, quote, ""When it comes to character creation and working with characters, I still take an active role in that. And looking back to the first generation Donkey Kong Country, we worked with Rayar to create Donkey Kong Country. When we were talking about trying to create new versions, evolving Donkey Kong, we created the game called Jungle Beat. We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With the technology that was available at the time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive. And going back to the design that Rare came up with, we re-evaluated what can we do with the design to make it more expressive. And then when it comes to the movie, we decided to move forward with this new generation Donkey Kong design. So, basically, the new design is to make Donkey Kong more expressive. And if you're not a fan of DK's throwback raccoon eyes, too bad, because they are here to stay, at least until the next redesign. Miiamoto had a lot of interesting stuff to say, primarily discussing the new Donkey Kong Country area at Universal's Epic Universe theme park that just opened in Orlando. But he also told IGN some pretty interesting tidbits about Nintendo's expansion, Beyond Gaming, and hinted at the possibility of more movies and shows in the works. You can go read the full interview over on IGN.com. The original Xbox didn't launch until 2001, so the platform isn't the first thing players usually associate with retro gaming. However, the company's back catalog did grow considerably after buying Activision Blizzard. And now some of those older titles are making their way onto Game Pass. Retro Classics with Game Pass is a new section that'll be available for all tiers of the subscription service, which the company calls a step in our commitment to game preservation and backwards compatibility. End quote. The collection is launching with more than 50 games from the 80s and 90s from series like Pitfall, Kaboom, Commando, and Mech Warrior. And there are sections for several platforms, Atari 2600, DOSs, and AmIGGA. Those are to be expected, but it's a little surprising to also see PSX and SNES categories, referring to obviously the PlayStation 1, and Super Nintendo, which Activision had a fair amount of games on. One nice quality of life improvement here is the ability to save and load progress. something we kind of take for granted, but something that also wasn't a standard feature for a lot of older games. There are also some multiplayer challenges and achievements to unlock for those of you who like doing that sort of thing. Retro Classics can be accessed anywhere you can get Game Pass as a standalone app, and you can expect more games to be added in the coming months. If you're not jumping out of your seat at the prospect of playing old Atari 2600 games on your 4K TV, there are also some new games coming to Game Pass as well. Today, the deck building rogue light Monster Train 2 comes to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass for Xbox Series, PC, and cloud. Tomorrow, Creatures of Ava, Senua Saga, Hellblade 2, and Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl will be available for Game Pass Standard subscribers on Xbox Series. On May 27th, Tom Clancy's The Division 2 will become available for all tiers of Game Pass on all supported platforms. Then, a day later, to a tea is a day one new release for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, which is coming to Xbox Series, PC, and cloud. This is the latest Wackadoo project from the creator of Katamari Damasi, which follows a teenager who's stuck in the to. So, if you load that game up and he's tosing, it's it's kind of the point. It's It's not a bug, it's a feature. [Music] On May 29th, Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers can check out Metaphor Refantasio, IGN's 2024 game of the year, or Spray Paint Simulator, which is exactly what it sounds like. Both of those are on Xbox Series, PC, and cloud. We also get a peek into June, and Crypt Custodian and Symphonia both hit Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard for Xbox Series Cloud and PC on June 3rd. And that is your fix for May 21st, 2025. While I've got you, just a reminder that we are getting so close to IGN Live.

THIS IS HOW GOD CREATED US. OUR LORD TELLS US TODAY THAT ""THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE THAN THIS: TO LAY DOWN ONE'S LIFE FOR ONE'S FRIENDS."" YOU KNOW THAT IS WHAT HE DID FOR US THIS IS THE MODEL OF LOVE THAT WE ARE CALLED TO LIVE WHEN HE SAYS: ""LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS I HAVE LOVED YOU."" ST. JOHN GIVES US SOMETHING IN HIS FIRST LETTER TO HELP MOTIVATE US TO PUT THAT LOVE INTO PRACTICE: HE SAYS: ""IN THIS IS LOVE: NOT THAT WE HAVE LOVED GOD, BUT THAT HE LOVED US AND SENT HIS SON TO BE THE EXPIATION FOR OUR SINS"" WE LEARN HOW TO LOVE OTHERS BY FIRST EXPERIENCING BEING LOVED• BY GOD HIMSELF. DO WE ALLOW GOD TO LOVE US? IT'S BEEN SAID THAT A SAINT IS ONE WHO LOVES GOD, BUT EVEN MORE SO, A SAINT IS ONE WHO IS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE LOVED BY GOD OUR GOD WANTS TO BE UNITED WITH US EVEN BEFORE HEAVEN, SO HE GIVES US A SHARE OF HIS OWN DIVINE LIFE HERE AND NOW. HE WANTS US TO BE UNITED WITH HIM HERE IN THIS LIFE AND WHEN BAPTIZED WE WERE PARTAKERS OF THE DIVINE NATURE AND HE SHARED WITH US HIS OWN DIVINE LIFE. AND HE TOLD US IN THE GOSPEL THE SIX CHAPTERED GIMMICK CHAPTER, IF WE EAT HIS FLESH AND DRINK HIS BLOOD IN THE HOLY EUCHARIST, WE ABIDE IN HIM, AND HE IN US. SO HE WANTS TO BE UNITED WITH US. AND YOU CAN THINK OF THE LAST SUPPER I HONESTLY EAT THIS PASSOVER WITH YOU. HE WANTS TO BE UNITED WITH US AND HE HAS SO VERY POWERFULLY AND PROFOUNDLY IN THE HOLY EUCHARIST IN THE HOLY COMMUNION. OUR LORD SAID TO ST. CATHERINE OF SIENA ┘ THAT NOTHING PLEASES HIM AS MUCH AS WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT HE LOVES US. IT IS THIS EXPERIENCE OF BEING LOVED, THAT HELPS US TO LOVE OTHERS. WHEN ONE IS IN LOVE, THERE IS JOY AND ENTHUSIASM THAT OVERCOMES EVEN THE TRIALS THAT PRESENT THEMSELVES TO US IN THIS LIFE. ST. PAUL GIVES US SOME POINTERS IN HIS 1 ST LETTER TO THE CORINTHIANS OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO LOVE: IN THIS, WEB COURSE IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY CHOSEN READINGS FOR WEDDINGS AND IT IS A GREAT REMINDER THAT ""LOVE IS PATIENT; LOVE IS KIND; LOVE IS NOT ENVIOUS OR BOASTFUL OR ARROGANT OR RUDE. IT DOES NOT INSIST ON ITS OWN WAY; IT IS NOT IRRITABLE OR RESENTFUL; IT DOES NOT REJOICE IN WRONGDOING, BUT REJOICES IN THE TRUTH. IT BEARS ALL THINGS, BELIEVES ALL THINGS, HOPES ALL THINGS, ENDURES ALL THINGS"" AND THIS IS A VERY GOOD EXAMINATION OF CONSCIOUS HOW HAVE I MEASURED UP IN FOLLOWING CHRIST IN THESE WAYS? OUR LORD SAYS TODAY TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS HE HAS LOVED US. NOTICE THAT HE DIDN'T SAY: LOVE ME AS I HAVE LOVED YOU. WE SHOW OUR LOVE FOR GOD BY OUR LOVE FOR OTHERS. AGAIN, ST. JOHN WROTE IN HIS 1 ST LETTER: ""HE WHO DOES NOT LOVE HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HAS SEEN, CANNOT LOVE GOD WHOM HE HAS NOT SEEN"" AND THAT IS VERY CHALLENGING. IT IS NOT EASY TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND THE MORE TIME WE SPEND WITH OTHERS, THE MORE WE SEE THEIR FLAWS AND WEAKNESSES AND FAULTS ┘ AND THE MORE THEY SEE OURS! AND MORE THEY HAVE TO PRACTICE PATIENCE TOWARDS US. IT'S NOT EASY, AND YET IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO LOVE. A. ST. PAUL TALKED ABOUT THE  -- TO PRACTICE THIS SACRIFICIAL LOVE. ST. PAUL TALKED ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF LOVE IN HIS LETTER TO THE CORINTHIANS, SAYING THAT IF HE HAD ALL SORTS OF GIFTS BUT DID NOT HAVE LOVE, HE WAS A ""NOISY GONG OR A CLANGING SYMBOL•.IF I HAVE ALL FAITH, SO AS TO MOVE MOUNTAINS, BUT HAVE NOT LOVE, I AM NOTHING"" SO LOVE IS NECESSARY IN FOLLOWING CHRIST. AND AS WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE, THE CROSS IS ALSO PART OF OUR LIFE. WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED WHEN THE CROSS APPEARS IN OUR LIVE. IN CHAPTER 2 OF THE BOOK OF SIRACH, WE READ THAT ""IF YOU COME FORWARD TO SERVE THE LORD PREPARE YOURSELF FOR TEMPTATION OR TRIALS IT IS DIFFICULT; THERE IS ADVERSITY LIFE IS CHALLENGING, BUT IF WE LET THAT REALITY SINK IN ┘ WE WILL NOT BE AS LIKELY TO BE CRUSHED WHEN TRIALS COME ┘ BECAUSE WE EXPECT IT TO BE DIFFICULT. IF WE EXPECT CHALLENGES AND ADVERSITY IN LIFE ┘ WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES AND GROW WITH THE HELP OF GOD'S GRACE. REMEMBER A SPEECH COACH STATEMENTS HAD WITH DEREK HENRY ONE OF THE MOST KNOWN RUNNING BACKS AND HE SAID IT WAS LIKE THAT PARTICULAR PRACTICE ABOUT 104 DEGREES ON THE FIELD. HE SAID TO DEREK, HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING? AND DEREK SAID, I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE, COACH. HE KNEW IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND THE CONDITIONS OUTSIDE WERE BLAZING HOT. I AND HE WAS HAPPY TO BE THERE MAKE. HE KNEW IT WOULD BE A GRUELING PROCESS. WE WILL BE TOUGH BUT GOD WILL GIVE US HIS GRACE TO SEE IT THROUGH. WE LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE IN THIS LIFE IS SHORT COMPARED TO ETERNITY. TO THE LORD GIVES US ALL THE GRACE AND ALL THE HELP THAT WE NEED TO PERSEVERE THROUGH THE LIFE. SO IF WE EXPECT CHALLENGES AND EXPECT THE CROSS, WE CAN MEET THOSE CHALLENGES THROUGH THE GRACE OF THE CROSS THROUGH THE HELP OF GOD'S GRACE. ST. PAUL WOULD SAY IN THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES THAT: ""IT IS THROUGH MANY TRIBULATIONS THAT WE MUST ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD. WE JUST HAD THIS READING THIS PAST SUNDAY. ST. PAUL KNEW VERY WELL THE EXPERIENCE OF SUFFERING. IN FACT, HE SAID THOSE KNOWING THE CONTEXT IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE A FEW VERSES LEAVING RIGHT UP TO THAT PASSAGE, WE HEAR THAT ST. PAUL HAD BEEN STONED BY THE PEOPLE AND THEY DRAGGED HIS BODY OUT OF THE CITY BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD KILLED HIM. BUT HE ROSE UP AND WENT RIGHT BACK INTO THE CITY AND BEGAN PREACHING AGAIN THE NEXT DAY. THAT IS WHEN HE SAYS IT IS THROUGH MANY TRIBULATIONS THAT WE MUST ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD. HE IS PROBABLY BLEEDING AND BRUISED AND MANY TRIBULATIONS WE ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD TO. THEY WERE HIS POWERS OF WORDS AND HE KNEW SUFFERING AND THE POWER OF GOD'S GRACE WORKING THROUGH HIS LIFE. AND THE LORD SAID CLEARLY IF WE WANT TO COME AFTER HIM WE MUST DENY OURSELVES, TAKE UP THE CROSS AND FOLLOW HIM. ARE LEFT FOR HIM IS MOST APPROVED IN TIMES OF TRIAL AND HARDSHIP. LOVE PROVES ITSELF IN TIMES OF DIFFICULTY. WE MAY NOT FEEL LIKE PRAYING OR GIVING OF OUR SALES AND SERVICE TO OTHERS AND LOVE DEMAND SACRIFICE, GIFT OF SELF. CARDINAL COMASTRI SHARED A STORY IN THE PAST ABOUT AN ENCOUNTER HE HAD AS A YOUNG PRIEST WITH MOTHER TERESA WHEN HE WAS JUST A YOUNG PRIEST AND MOTHER TERESA WAS VISITING ROME AND HE REALLY WANTED TO MEET HER. HE DEMANDED TO SEE HER AND HE WENT TO THE CONVENT WHERE SHE WAS AND SHE CAME TO MEET HIM. HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF SHE WAS INTERESTED ALSO WAS. SHE ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS PRAYER LIFE AND HOW LONG HE PRAYED EACH DAY. HE SHARED THAT HE ATTENDED MASS EVERY DAY AND PRAYED THE LITURGY OF THE HOURS ANY PRAYED THE ROSARY AND HE SAID HE WAS PRETTY CONTENT WITH HIS ANSWER AND HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE PRETTY PLEASED WITH HIS ANSWER APPEARED TO PUT RESPONSE SURPRISED HIM AND SHE SAID THE DEBT THAT NOT ENOUGH. ""LOVE CANNOT BE LIVED MINIMALLY"" SHE THEN ENCOURAGED HIM TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO MORE PRAYER IN EUCHARISTIC ADORATION BEFORE THE BLESSED SACRAMENT AND THE YOUNG PRIEST WHO TOLD MOTHER TERESA THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE ASKED HIM SOMETHING LIKE HOW MUCH CHARITY HE DID TOWARD THE POOR. HAD HIS HE SPENT HIS TIME HELPING THE POOR AND HIS CHARITY FOR THE POOR? SHE RESPONDED, ""DO YOU THINK IF I DIDN'T PRAY I WOULD BE ABLE TO LOVE THE POOR? IT'S JESUS THAT PUTS LOVE IN MY HEART WHEN I PRAY."" SHE DOESN'T JUST GO OUT THERE MORE AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO SERVE OTHERS IF SHE IS NOT FILLED UP WITH THE LORD AND HIS GRACE TO BEGIN WITH. SHE THEN TOLD HIM TO READ SCRIPTURE. SHE ENCOURAGED HIM THAT IT IS THROUGH SCRIPTURE, WE ARE REMINDED THAT ""WITHOUT GOD, WE ARE TOO POOR TO HELP THE POOR."" SO OUR DAILY COMMITMENT TO PRAYER AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD IS WHAT FUELS OUR LOVE FOR OTHERS! AND THAT IS WHAT GIVES US STRENGTH TO GO OUT AND GIVE UP OURSELVES AND TO SERVE OTHERS. AS WE PREPARE TO RECEIVE THE LORD'S BODY AND BLOOD IN THE EUCHARIST, WE PRAY THAT WE MAY LOVE CHRIST WITH ALL OF OUR HEART ┘ IN A GENEROUS DAILY COMMITMENT TO PRAYER - AND TO KEEP HIS COMMANDMENT TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS HE HAS LOVED US. WITH CONFIDENCE IN GOD'S POWER AND LOVE ME AT MANIFEST IN THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST AND LET US PRAY. >> FOR CHURCH LEADERS MY OWN WORDS AND ACTIONS MAY CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE US TO GROW IN FAITH, WE PRAYED TO THE LORD. >> LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYER. >> THAT THE PEOPLE OF GOD MAY EXERCISE LOVE AND MERCY AND GOD DESIRES US TO SHOW TO THE WEAKEST MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, WE PRAYED TO THE LORD. >> LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYER. >> FOR THE INTENTIONS ALL ASKED OF OUR PRAYERS THAT IN HIS MERCY THE LORD ASSISTS IN OUR NEEDS, BE PAID TO THE LORD. >> LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYER.

HUAWBnaWqXQ,17630,2620,337,The Holy Spirit: God’s Presence – Daily Devotional,20250522,"[Music] Here's today's InTouch devotion. Today's scripture reading is Acts 2:es 1 through 4. When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves. And they rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit was giving them utterance. Some people think the Holy Spirit's first appearance was at Pentecost, but he's mentioned in the creation account and throughout the Old Testament and Gospels. Then in today's passage, the spirit arrives in the upper room with a fresh mission. In the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit empowered individuals for specific tasks. For example, Bezal's God-given wisdom and craftsmanship enabled him to become the tabernacle's chief architect. We also read that the spirit settled upon leaders needing help in administration, warriors facing formidable tasks and men called to proclaim God's word, indicating that the spirit's involvement with believers would be different than before. Jesus told the disciples, ""He abides with you and will be in you."" God's holy spirit had come alongside them during their time with Jesus, but would dwell within them following the ascension. Since Pentecost, every believer has received the Holy Spirit. If Jesus is the vine and we're the branches, then the Spirit is the energizing sap that equips us. He no longer comes and goes, but now remains permanently. He seals us in Christ, proof of the promise that we are forever in God's presence. [Music]",0.022,0.836,0.142,0.984
YbenlhLRYTA,39615,0,0,"Sunday Mass May 25, 2025",20250524,"Thank you for joining us for today's mass. And now we join our celebrant, Father Jack Schaefer, and our server, Seminarian Michael Isoma. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. Have mercy on us, O Lord, for we have sinned against you. Show us, O Lord, your mercy and grant us your salvation. May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Amen. Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to people of good will. We praise you. We bless you. We adore you. We glorify you. We give you thanks for your great glory. Lord God, heavenly king, oh God, almighty father, Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten son, Lord God, lamb of God, son of the father, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. You take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. You are seated at the right hand of the Father. Have mercy on us. For you alone are the holy one. You alone are the Lord. You alone are the most high. Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit in the glory of God the Father. Amen. Let us pray. Grant Almighty God that we may celebrate with heartfelt devotion these days of joy which we keep in honor of the risen Lord and that what we relive in remembrance we may always hold to in what we do through our Lord Jesus Christ your son who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit God forever and ever. Amen. A reading from the Acts of the Apostles. Some who had come down from Judea were instructing the brothers, ""Unless you are circumcised according to the Mosaic practice, you cannot be saved."" Because there arose no little dissension and debate by Paul and Barnabas with them, it was decided that Paul, Barnabas, and some of the others should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question. The apostles and elders in agreement with the whole church decided to choose representatives and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. The ones chosen were Judas, who was called Barsabus and Silas, leaders among the brothers. This is the letter delivered by them. The apostles and the elders, your brothers, to the brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cissia of Gentile origin. Greetings. Since we have heard that some of our number who went out without any mandate from us have upset you with their teachings and disturbed your peace of mind, we have with one accord decided to choose representatives and to send them to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul who have dedicated their lives to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. So we are sending Judas and Silas who will also convey this same message by word of mouth. It is the decision of the Holy Spirit and of us not to place on you any burden beyond the necessities, namely to abstain from meat sacrificed to idols, from blood, from meats of strangled animals, and from unlawful marriage. If you keep free of these, you will be doing what is right. Farewell. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Oh God, let all the nations praise you. Oh God, let all the nations praise you. May God have pity on us and bless us. May he let his face shine upon us. So may your way be known upon earth among all nations. your salvation. Oh God, let all the nations praise you. May the nations be glad and exalt because you rule the peoples in equity. The nations on earth you guide. Oh God, let all the nations praise you. May the peoples praise you, oh God. May all the peoples praise you. May God bless and may all the ends of the earth fear him. Oh God, let all the nations praise you. A reading from the book of Revelation. The angel took me in spirit to a great high mountain and showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God. It gleamed with the splendor of God. Its radiance was like that of a precious stone like jasper, clear as crystal. It had a massive high wall with 12 gates where 12 angels were stationed and on which names were inscribed the names of the 12 tribes of the Israelites. There were three gates facing east, three north, three south, and three west. The wall of the city had 12 courses of stones as its foundation, on which were inscribed the 12 names of the twel apostles of the lamb. I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb. The city had no need of sun or moon to shine on it. For the glory of God gave it light, and its lamp was the lamb. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Spirit of God be my heart. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to John. Glory to you, O Lord. Jesus said to his disciples, ""Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. Yet the word you hear is not mine, but that of the Father who sent me. I have told you this while I am with you. The advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and remind you of all that I told you. Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid. You heard me tell you, I am going away and I will come back to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you this before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe. The Gospel of the Lord. Praise to you Lord Jesus Christ. Father Steven Verb best tells a story about a 4-year-old girl who heard that Jesus lives in the hearts of those who love him. Struggling to grasp what this could mean, she climbed into her mother's lap one day and pressed her ear tightly against her side. ""What are you doing?"" her mother asked. The child placed her index finger across her lips and whispered, ""I'm listening for Jesus inside you."" Enjoying her closeness, she let her daughter listen for a while. And then she said, ""Well, did you hear Jesus within me?"" Yes, I did, she replied. And it sounds like he's making coffee. What a wonderful way to contemplate this remarkable mystery. While Jesus is not making coffee, this little girl actually has the right idea. His presence in our hearts is as natural as sharing a cup of coffee with someone we love or sharing a hug with them. The book of Revelation expresses it this way. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, then I will enter his house and dine with him and he with me. Whether you liken intimacy with Jesus to sharing a cup of coffee, a hug, or a meal together, the reality is the true presence of Christ in the hearts of those who love him. Jesus made a profound promise to his disciples during the last supper in the upper room. Whoever loves me will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him. This intimate gathering is a powerful symbol of Jesus loving presence within our hearts. Similar to the last supper, our relationship with Jesus is intrinsically communal. At its core, it is a communion with the Trinity as Jesus brings the Father and the Holy Spirit with him, inviting us to partake in their divine love. There's a second reason intimacy with Jesus is always communal. Like the last supper, all who receive the body and blood of Jesus become one body with him and with each other by the power of his spirit. The Holy Spirit dwelling within us teaches us all things, especially to grow in greater and greater love for everyone. When God dwells in the upper room of our hearts, we become tabernacles for the world, bringing the loving presence of God wherever we go. And together we profess our faith. I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontious Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day, he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. From there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. In the joy of this Easter season, in our hope for redemption, we bring these prayers of petition before our loving and compassionate father. For the church throughout the world that we may recognize the great gift we are offered in God's promise of redemption. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. for the leaders of the church that they may be a beacon of light in this world pointing the way to the truth of God's kingdom. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer for those without faith that through the goodness of others, they may come to believe in the existence and the goodness of God. We pray to the Lord. Lord, here our prayer for ourselves that we may reach out to others with the love and compassion that we receive from the risen Christ. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer for all who have died and gone before us in the faith of Christ that they may enjoy the peace of God's kingdom. In a special way today, we remember Peta and Guida Pugeste. We pray to the Lord. Lord, here our prayer for the homebound and the sick, for those who care for them, and for all those intentions we now offer from the silence of our hearts. For these we pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. God our loving father, we beg you to hear the prayers we offer you this day and to answer them according to your holy will and help us to follow your will in all that we say and do. We make our prayer through Christ our Lord. Amen. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands. It will become for us the bread of life. Blessed be God forever. By the mystery of this water and wine, may we come to share in the divinity of Christ, who humbled himself to share. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the wine we offered you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands. It will become our spiritual drink. Blessed be God forever. Pray friends that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father. May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name, for our good and the good of all his holy church. May our prayers rise up to you, O Lord, together with the sacrificial offerings, so that purified by your graciousness, we may be conformed to the mysteries of your mighty love. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. Lift up your hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is right and just. It is truly right and just our duty and our salvation at all times to acclaim you, O Lord, but in this time above all to lod you yet more gloriously when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. For with the old order destroyed, a universe cast down is renewed and integrity of life is restored to us in Christ. Therefore, overcome with pascal joy, every land, every people exalts in your praise, and even the heavenly powers with the angelic hosts sing together the unending hym of your glory as they acclaim, ""Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosana in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, the f of all holiness. Make holy, therefore, these gifts we pray by sending down your spirit upon them like the dwfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving thanks, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, ""Take this all of you and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you. In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice and once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples saying, ""Take this all of you and drink from it. For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity. Together with Leo our pope and William our bishop and all the clergy. Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all. We pray that with the blessed Virgin Mary, mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be co-airs to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your son Jesus Christ. Through him and with him and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen. At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our savior Jesus Christ. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, ""Peace I leave you. My peace I give you. look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will. Who live and reign forever and ever. Amen. The peace of the Lord be with you always. And with your spirit. Peace be with you. Thank you. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace. Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. For those who cannot join us in person and receive the eukarist, we now offer this act of spiritual communion. My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the most holy sacrament. I love you above all things and I desire to receive you into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace you as if you were already there and unite myself wholly to you. Never permit me to be separated from you. [Music] Amen. Let us pray. Almighty everliving God, who restore us to eternal life in the resurrection of Christ, increase in us, we pray the fruits of this pascal sacrament, and pour into our hearts the strength of this saving food through Christ our Lord. Amen. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. May almighty God bless you, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. The mass has ended. Go in peace. Thanks be to God.",0.044,0.699,0.256,1.0
JigW2xW4Dn8,12512,1038,75,"Bring It to God | Audio Reading | Our Daily Bread Devotional | May 14, 2025",20250514,"Hezekiah received the letter and spread it out before the Lord. 2 Kings 19:14. Welcome to today's encouragement from our daily bread. Our reading titled Bring It to God was written and read by Tom Felton. 2 Kings 19 14- 20. Hezekiah received the letter from his messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord. And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord. Lord, the God of Israel enthroned between the cherubim. You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. Give ear, Lord, and hear. Open your eyes, Lord, and see. Listen to the words Sinakarb has sent to ridicule the living God. It is true, Lord, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands. They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them. For they are not gods, but only wood and stone fashioned by human hands. Now Lord our God, deliver us from his hand so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, Lord our God. Then Isaiah son of Amos sent a message to Hezekiah. This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says, ""I have heard your prayer concerning Sinakaribb, king of Assyria. Bring it to God. Brian had been with the heart specialist for more than an hour. His friend remained in the waiting room, praying for wisdom and healing for his ailing friend. When Brian finally returned to the waiting room, he showed him the pile of papers he'd received. As he spread them out on a table, he discussed the various options being considered to treat his threatening condition. The two discussed the need to pray and ask God for wisdom for next steps. And then Brian said, ""Whatever lies ahead, I'm in God's hands."" In 2 Kings 19, King Hezekiah spread a letter out before the Lord. The words in the letter didn't address a threatening medical condition, but the threat of a powerful enemy, Assyria, that had seized all the fortified cities of Judah and was preparing to attack Jerusalem, its capital. Hezekiah prayed, ""You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth."" Now, Lord our God, deliver us. Soon the prophet Isaiah sent a message to Hezekiah telling him, ""The Lord says, I have heard your prayer."" And that night, God destroyed the Assyrian army. Whatever you face today, spread it out before God. As you present your requests to God, he hears you and is with you. You can rest in his hands as you experience his wisdom, love, and hope. Let's pray. Lord, we bring our burdens and fears to you, trusting in your power, and faithfulness. Thank you for hearing our prayers and giving us peace as we rest in your loving hands. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. As you go about your day, reflect on these questions. What will it mean for you to spread out before God the concerns on your heart today? How can you choose to rest in his power and presence? [Music]",0.071,0.717,0.212,0.9982
orCrvgkrbjA,39947,448,330,Russia fires hundreds of drones and missiles at Ukraine in one of the largest attacks of the war,20250525,"This is what prompted the strongest condemnation of Russia by America. Ukrainian officials say it was the biggest aerial attack yet in 3 years of war. Overnight, Russia launched nearly 300 drones and 70 missiles at Ukraine. It doesn't come without casualties. 12-year-old Tamara and her brothers Stannislav, who was eight, and Roman, who was 17, all died when their home was hit. They were among at least 12 civilians killed across the country. Keith Kellogg, the US special presidential envoy to Ukraine, said the indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva peace protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire [Applause] now. Rescue workers occasionally shout instructions. The rest of the time they work quietly. Earlier Ukraine's leader had criticized the global silence. In a post on social media, President Zalinski said, ""This cannot be ignored. Silence of America, silence of others around the world only encourages Putin. The world knows all the weaknesses of the Russian economy. The war can be stopped, but only through the necessary force of pressure on Russia. Putin must be forced to think not about launching missiles, but about ending the war. Meanwhile, in a sign that end is nowhere near, the Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses had shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight. All this escalation at the same time as a moment of compassion from both sides. 303 Russian soldiers released from Ukrainian captivity in exchange for the same number in the other direction.

L9gcInxNSHc,68744,4612,485,Why did Germany Lose World War I? Kings and Generals Animated DOCUMENTARY,20250525,"Losing sides in wars tend to blame 
internal enemies, external interference,   corrupt elites, inept politicians and 
commanders in their defeat. After all,   one’s glorious nation and its mighty 
army could not possibly have lost a war   just because the other side was better 
prepared militarily and economically.   There has to be a malevolent force which has 
orchestrated this outcome from the shadows.   This process of cope happened to Germany after 
World War 1 with the emergence of the “Stab in the   Back” myth, which blamed the defeat of the German 
Empire to Britain, France and the United States to   the communists and Jewish people living among the 
German people. This myth played a significant part   in the emergence of the Nazi regime in Germany 
and another devastating global war. Naturally,   this narrative was a false one. So why did 
Germany really lose World War 1? In this video,   we will examine the military, economic and social 
factors that might help us answer that question. If only it were as easy to find the 
answer as it is to questions like:   what is your date of birth, home address,

For a very long   time after World War 1, there was a consensus 
in German society that although their country   had lost the war, it was not because their 
army had been defeated on the battlefield.   This mentality was embodied by Hitler and the 
Nazis, whose whole worldview stood on this   premise. Yet even the first leader of the Weimar 
republic, the social democrat Friedrich Ebert,   shared this sentiment. “Kein Fiend hat euch 
überwunden!” He said to the returning German   soldiers. No enemy has vanquished you! However, 
as much as the Germans sought to insist upon   the undefeated status of their armies, this 
claim is simply incorrect. While there are a   myriad of complex reasons behind the German 
defeat in World War 1, which we will examine   in this video. But the first and foremost cause 
of the loss was the situation on the battlefield. It must be remembered that Germany was fighting 
a war on two fronts, initially against Russia   in the East and the combined French and British 
force in the west. The German strategy was based   on the Schlieffen Plan which in hindsight was 
extremely optimistic. It envisaged Russia taking   at least six weeks to mobilize for a war against 
Germany, a calculation based on an extremely   incompetent display of the Russian army during the 
Russo-Japanese war of 1905. Before Russia could   raise its armies, Germany aimed to swiftly occupy 
the Netherlands and Belgium in order to avoid the   heavily fortified French-German border. The German 
army then would enter France through Flanders,   march directly on Paris, then envelop and 
destroy the French army. France was to be   defeated in around six weeks, at which point, 
the victorious German army would swiftly arrive   on the East front to face the mobilized Russian 
army. It is hard to understate how much had to go   right in order for the Schlieffen Plan to work as 
intended for Germany. Indeed, many things in this   plan were outside of the German control, which 
is never a good recipe for a successful strategy. Russia completed its mobilization in just 12 days. 
In mid-August, Russians invaded East Prussia,   forcing the German command to relocate 
some 100,000 men from the Western front.   Although the Russians were soundly defeated 
in the first battles on the Eastern front,   the German forces on the Western front 
were now weakened. Belgium offered more   resistance than expected, delaying 
the German advance into France by   several weeks. German violation of Belgian 
neutrality brought Britain into the war.   Although the German advance into France was 
initially quite rapid, they were stopped in   the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914. 
The result was an unbreakable stalemate and trench   warfare on the Western front. On September 
9, 1914, the German chief of staff von Moltke   said that Germany had lost the war. Failure to 
gain a rapid victory on the Western front now   meant that Germany had to fight on two fronts, 
which was a massive strain on its resources. When the war started, Germany was the leading 
producer of steel in the world. Early on in   the war, Germany had the advantage of being the 
most industrialized country in Europe. However,   Britain had the largest navy in the world and used 
it to impose a naval blockade on Germany, which   harmed the German military production during the 
war immensely. Soon after the blockade started,   Germany started experiencing shortages of 
resources vital for military production,   including cordite, nitrate, 
camphor, saltpetre, and pyrites. When it became clear that this war was going to 
last, Germany transitioned to a wartime economy,   prioritizing military expenses. They created 
the KRA, the War Raw Materials Department,   to find solutions to the shortages and ensure 
steady military supplies. But this was done at   the expense of civilians, which was going to 
bite the Germans back eventually. For a time,   the wartime economy achieved its desired 
effect. For instance, in 1916, Germany   produced 36 million shells, a 4-fold increase 
from its 1915 production of 8.9 million shells. Had Germany faced only one or perhaps even two 
of the Entente powers, they might have succeeded   thanks to its powerful army and industrial 
capacity. However, the reality was that they   were facing three major European powers, and 
their combined military and economic power   was higher than Germany’s. Germany’s allies, on 
the other hand, were second-rate powers like the   declining Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires 
and the newly independent Bulgaria. The total   military expenditure of the Central Powers 
in World War 1 was 61.5 billion dollars, less   than half of the 147 billion dollars the Entente 
spent if we take the late arrival of the United   States into consideration. And we should, 
because the American involvement in the war   was akin to a death sentence for the German 
Empire, which was running on fumes by 1918. Germany attempted a blockade of its own 
against Britain, which was mostly carried   out through German U-boats targeting merchant 
vessels supplying Britain. They managed to sink   5,000 merchant ships but ultimately failed to 
stop the regular delivery of supplies. Instead,   they angered Americans by sinking American 
merchant vessels and killing American citizens.   This angered Washington, and the leaking of the 
secret diplomatic note of the German foreign   minister Arthur Zimmermann was the final straw. 
In his letter to the German ambassador to Mexico,   Zimmermann instructed the ambassador to persuade 
Mexico to declare war against the United States,   promising military support to recognize 
the states of New Mexico, Texas and   Arizona as sovereign Mexican territory. 
British intelligence leaked this letter,   and a month later, in April 1917, the 
United States declared war on Germany. By the time the American Expeditionary Force 
started arriving, Russia was in disarray and   practically out of the war. Germany could 
now focus on the western front. In hindsight,   some argue that this was the point when 
Germany should have asked for diplomatic   talks and achieved favourable 
terms from the Allies. Instead,   Germany saw this as a moment when they needed 
to launch the decisive blow on the Entente,   particularly before the Americans were ready 
to attack them. Victories over Italy, Greece,   and Serbia rejuvenated Germany's morale. As the 
German command prepared what General Ludendorff   called the Peace Offensive on the Western front, 
there was true hope that the Kaiser might emerge   victorious from the Great War. Germany transferred 
40 divisions from the Eastern front and gained a   numerical advantage for the first time since 1914. 
Britain and France had suffered massive casualties   by then and were exhausted by the war, too. 
There was a mutiny in the French army in 1917.   British units were understaffed after horrific 
losses suffered in the Passchendaele offensive. On 21 March 1918, Germany launched Operation 
Michael to start its decisive offensive. The   goal was to split the British and French armies 
into two by capturing the Somme region. Germany   carried out four other operations to break the 
Allied resistance. However, even though Germans   gained further ground in these operations, France 
and Britain, now bolstered by American troops,   prevented Germany from achieving decisive success. 
Germany had now spent its last crucial military   resources, including its stormtroopers from 
the eastern front, without much to show for it. In August, the Allies launched the Hundred 
Days Offensive, overwhelming the demoralized   German troops. In late September, the formidable 
Hindenburg line was breached. German defences   were collapsing. Simultaneously, 
Germany’s allies in Austria-Hungary,   Bulgaria and Turkey were exiting out of the 
war one by one due to military defeats or   internal collapse. Germany was also facing 
an internal collapse, which we will talk   about moment. In early October, Germany sued 
for peace, and a month later, the war ended. It is clear that the situation on the battlefield 
forced Germany to end the war. But here the   question is: how important was the United States’ 
involvement in Germany’s defeat? This question is   open to speculation. The deployment of American 
troops within French and British units during   the final German offensive helped stabilize 
the situation and fend off the German attack.   The American involvement in the Second Battle 
of Marne was an important factor in stopping   the German advance and the launch of the 
decisive Allied counter-offensive. Finally,   the first major offensive of this final 
campaign was the Meuse-Argonne offensive,   spearheaded by over 1 million American troops. 
So, whether the exhausted French and British   troops would have enough steam left to stop the 
German attack and then launch a counter-attack   is up to debate. Still, the very presence of the 
American army in Europe was perhaps sufficient   for the German command to understand that any 
further fighting was futile. In that sense, the   American involvement was the final major piece of 
the puzzle that made the German defeat inevitable. Of course, one should not overlook the morale 
problem in the German ranks. Obviously, any army   fighting for four years without a clear prospect 
of victory is bound to have morale issues.   The arrival of the American army arguably 
exacerbated this problem. From July 1918,   the discipline in the German army started 
to deteriorate rather rapidly. Mutinies,   desertions and mass surrender became common. Up 
until July 1918, 327,000 Germans had surrendered   in World War 1. In August and September 1918 
alone, 233,000 surrendered to the Allies. HOME FRONT COLLAPSE
However, Germany’s   defeat in the First World War was not just 
about the situation on the battlefield. The   Schlieffen plan was devised to win the 
war fast, but after failing to do so,   the war of attrition became the new reality. 
Here the Entente, particularly Britain and   France with their vast empires and resources, 
were better prepared for a long war. Moreover,   even though the United States stayed neutral until 
1917, they had much closer economic ties with the   allies during that time. Up until 1917, Britain 
and France received 2.25 billion dollars worth of   loans from American banks, which was spent 
on buying military goods and food from the   United States. To compare, Germany received 
only 27 million dollars worth of loans. British naval superiority played a crucial role 
in Germany’s defeat as well. The blockade imposed   by them prevented Germany from trading with 
foreign nations and purchasing vital military   and civilian goods. Early in the war, Germany 
started prioritizing military production, which   inevitably caused shortages in other industries. 
The mobilization of farmers and the prioritization   of the use of fertilizers for military production 
all harmed food production, and in 1915,   the German government imposed bread rationing. The 
poor harvest of 1915 caused further shortages. The   failure of the potato crop, an important part 
of the German diet, exacerbated the situation. In 1916-17, Germans lived through the so-called 
Turnip winter, as scarcely available potatoes   and meat were now substituted by turnip 
for ordinary Germans. The food rationing   by this year was growing harsher. Losses on 
the battlefield forced Germany to draft even   skilled factory workers onto the front line 
and substitute them with unskilled labour,   making German productivity worse. The lack of 
good news from the front and the increasingly   desperate situation at home led to unrest. The 
first significant strike took place in Berlin   in April 1916 in protest against the arrest 
of anti-war socialist leader Karl Liebknecht. Following the Russian February Revolution, the 
German strike movement grew as well. In April   1917, around 200,000 workers went on strike in 
Berlin, Leipzig, Stuttgart and other major cities,   demanding better working conditions and protesting 
food shortages. Demands to end the war started   becoming more regular. The German strike movement 
peaked in January of 1918. Over one million German   workers went on strike throughout the country 
and one of their key demands was peace without   annexations, the popular anti-war socialist 
slogan. The German government used the military   to suppress this strike, but it was telling that 
the German socialists who had supported the war   in 1914 were now striking to end the war in such 
large numbers. The final nail in the coffin of the   German empire was the mutiny of sailors in Kiel. 
While peace talks had already started, the German   naval command ordered its fleet to launch a final, 
desperate attack on the British navy blockading   the North Sea in late October. The sailors refused 
these orders and staged a massive demonstration in   Kiel on November 3rd. These sparked a revolution 
throughout Germany leading to the fall of the   Empire, but by then the fate of the First 
World War had already been sealed. A month   earlier on October 1st, General Ludendorff asked 
Emperor Wilhelm II to seek truce with the Allies. STAB IN THE BACK AND CONCLUSION
The fall of the Empire and the   subsequent capitulation created this 
perception in Germany that in fact German   had not been defeated on the battlefield, but 
lost due to the betrayal by internal enemies,   such as communists and Jews. This 
was the stab-in-the-back myth,   or dolchstosslegende in German. Particularly, 
it was the conservative and the nationalist   strata propagated this narrative. However, 
even republicans such as Friedrich Ebert,   one of the founders of Weimar Germany, 
played their role in the entrenchment of   this myth in the German psyche. This would 
eventually have disastrous consequences. It is true that the internal collapse played 
an important role in the German defeat.   Food shortages, poor working conditions, lack 
of realistic prospects of victory and the war   fatigue all caused public unrest in Germany 
culminating in the fall of the Empire. However,   the truth is that by the time all these factors 
were building up, the German army was already   on the brink of collapse. Their main defensive 
line was breached, fresh American troops were   advancing and German soldiers surrendering en 
masse. Even if the revolution had not happened,   the German army was on the verge of total defeat 
by the autumn of 1918. The war could have gone   on for longer, but the result would have been the 
same. Otherwise the German military command would   not seek negotiations. So, it is a myth that the 
German army was not defeated on the battlefield   in World War 1. They were. The combination of 
the American involvement, the German exhaustion   both on the battlefield and at home, the British 
naval blockade and the Entente advantage in the   war of attrition war led to Germany’s defeat 
in World War 1 and the fall of its empire.  More videos on the First World War are on the

lq_8Di8TOBM,43174,4058,701,"Neil, Tim and John, Graveyard talk",20250525,"Welcome to this talk and we're here with Dr. Tim Kelly and uh Mr. Neil Oliver and we're here to discuss uh one of Neil's new books, one of many on hauntings. Now, it sounds a bit uh supernatural uh Neil really. What what motivated you to write a book about this? I'm I'm always I always write about history one way or another. And I felt that this was another way in, another way to invite people in because all of these uh stories of hauntings that they're all very much tied to places, houses, battlefields, various locations in the landscape. And I'm always interested by the way in which a a location will become famous often for something that was a a very brief event. You know, a battle, you know, some of the classic battles like a collord or a ban burn when you're really talking about things that happen over the course of hours or at most a day or so. But of course, that place is then uh means many more things to generation after generation of people. you know that that to which we pin uh significance is a is a transitory um and there are there are residues of all of the events that unfold in a place arguably that linger and I I felt over the last few years where so many people and myself included I've have I've gone through a lot of anxiety a lot of uncertainty a lot of stress and it it's in times of sustained stress for whole populations at the same time. That historically there have often been manifestations of phenomena. And you might say, and there might be quite reasonable scientific reasons for saying that or for asking the question, why wouldn't the stress of millions of people felt at the same time? Why wouldn't it manifest in ways that people might experience? And really when you say what was my motivation to write it, it really in the simplest of terms it was because decades of making the kind of history documentaries that I had been making had put me in the presence of people of all sorts, you know, academic people, regular people like myself. And there were so many instances where people would say, ""Do you know a funny thing happened to me here?"" I was often on a on a television filming day. we would be with someone who had a connection to a battlefield or a connection to a church or whatever and they were they were there on the day to tell us something personal or something specific but during the course of a long day so often people would say you know don't tell anyone but I was here once 20 years ago and I saw such and such or I I felt the presence of and really collectively I thought over the years I thought all these people can't be lying neither are they just making it for fun. Maybe some of them are, maybe it's just, you know, something that they're doing out of a sense of, you know, harmless mischief. But a lot of these uh experiences that people are having and attesting to, they've experienced something and it falls to the edges of, you know, what we're invited to think about in our science and technology dominated world. But I thought it's it's surely high time to have some open conversations about what people are experiencing. I mean, to me, the book was very much about history. Um, very much a sense of place, but but something very human about it. Well, these I mean, I don't know about you, Tim. I don't know about you, John. I I don't know if you've had any experiences like it, but they're certainly not unusual. Many, many people it will will under the right circumstances will say that they've experienced something, and it's usually in a location. it it's usually they've gone somewhere and they're tied tied to place. They've experienced something in a location and it's a it's a very common human phenomena. Part of the problem I think for people they want many people want to talk about these things but there's a degree of ridicule that goes with saying I saw a ghost or I I I think I think I had an encounter with the supernatural. People are wary of doing it for fear of ridicule, for fear of being thought to be slightly, you know, cookie or mad. And I think that's a shame and it's a consequence of so much of this being driven to the periphery by science. Science doesn't address this kind of story. Um there's there's no there's no space in science for this at all, is there? Why would there be? Why would there be? But it means that the the language even is archaic for people that want to talk about these sorts of experiences. They're kind of pushed into an acronist language. They have to talk about ghosts and they talk they have to talk about spirits and it makes them feel uncomfortable. So even the language associated with these phenomena, even the word phenomena sounds a bit woowoo, but it only means it's Greek. I mean it only means something like that which appears or is seen. It's actually factual. This is real phenomena. Uh and people definitely want to talk about it and I hoped that by recounting some of the stories in the book will be familiar. You know there's the there's the brown lady of Rainom Hall. You know, there's, you know, visitations by specters like Henry VIII and Anne Berlin that people might expect in places like Windsor Castle and the Tower of London. Others, though, will be less familiar. And it was all in an attempt to reassure people really that these kinds of experiences are real in as much as all sorts of people have them. And I think there are useful, helpful conversations that people can have. Yeah. human experience is is intrinsically legitimate, isn't it? When we stop listening to people's experiences, we're missing something. Tim, you're the straight guy in this. Um, initial thoughts. I'm pretty skeptical. I could actually remember. Have you ever come across the captain's wife? No. So, the village that I come from in in Wales, uh, little tiny village called Sully, and there's a uh there's a pub there called the Captain's Wife. And it's called the captain's wife because there was a a ship a long time ago the the captain basically smuggled his wife onto the ship and the crew found out about it and it was a time when it was not the done thing. It was bad luck to have a woman on the ship. And so if I recount the story correctly, they chucked her overboard basically u in the chest and uh she drowned and then this uh captain's wife has been haunting the the area ever since. Um, I I quite like to I like to think that there is something to these stories and especially like astrology as well. I like to read about horoscopes and things like that because I just think it's it's fun. Um, but uh I suppose deep down I'm quite skeptical about it. To me, I think part of the fascination for me is we've we have for some centuries now lived dominated by science, the scientific method. And science is brilliant. You know, science has given us modern medicine. It has given us technology. It has enhanced life and lives for millions of people in so many ways, undisputed. But but science is largely about how quote it's explanatory. It's observational. It it makes deductions based on on what can be seen and readily explained. And that's all excellent, but at the same time, it has driven to the edges what it actually feels like to be human and alive. Science doesn't really address why, and it doesn't really address what's it like. I mean, science can tell you everything you like about the color blue, you know, the frequency, the the wavelength of that light and all of the rest of it, but it it cannot and does not and should not address what it's like to look at the color blue. And and and likewise, I mean, I I often cite the the the conspiracy theory of flat earth because whatever you think of that, while science explains planets, gravity, orbits, galaxies, the rotation, the flight through the the infinite. That's not what it feels like. It feels like we're living on a flat earth. Yeah. That is what it feels like. Yeah. And it feels and it looks as if the lights in the sky, the sun and the moon included, are moving across us on a flat tabletop. That is what it feels like. So, it's understandable that people are drawn to the idea of flat earth because I've yet to meet anyone that has felt the rotation of the earth or the fact that we're flying through the universe at tens of thousands of miles an hour. And it's the it's the what's it like that I think matters most to people. And people also, rightly or wrongly, uh have a need for meaning. Yeah. And there are there are experiences, there are thoughts that people have, there are aspects of what it is to be human and alive that are not and should not be addressed by science. But but at the same time, I think people have the need to have these to acknowledge that these things are happening to them. Does that put a in your scientific armor, Tim? No, but I really like the the blue analogy. Um and it's it's a point I've made myself as well. Well, have you come across the philosopher Alan Watts? Yes. Cuz I mean, he talks about this all the time, how we we have this uh we use language to construct models of our reality and then we mistake the signposts in the language for the actual reality itself. And another example would be uh time. So, you've got what physicists would see as time, something that you can um map on a clock to to to make an equation for predicting when something's going to happen. But then you've got the subjective um feeling of time which is something completely different. If if you're waiting in a queue in a supermarket the the five minutes might seem like an hour but if you're having fun it it goes really quickly. So the subjective versus the objective. So um there's I think that's a interesting aspect. The anthropologist Wade Davis makes a lot of excellent points. You know, he talks about how um the the the world into which you are born, the reality that you experience does not exist in any absolute sense. It's a model and that other peoples of the world have other ways of modeling reality and that other people are not failed attempts at being you. you know that on the contrary they are vital answers to the question of what it is to be human and alive and he he also he often cites the example of the way in which he's spent time in the in the uh the South American rainforest with with the indigenous people and and as a as a as a biologist or as an anthropologist has asked them how they came upon the recipe for Iawaska you know which is the the the psychedelic psychedelic And it's it's brought it's made by bringing together the bark of a lyana, the sort of tarzan swinging things that that hang. And also one of about 80 or 90 different shrublike plants that are kind of related to the coffee plant. I think it's called psychotria uh uh vitrus. It's a name like that. And he and he says there's no objective way of understanding how even with infinite experimentation the peoples could have found these two things and brought them together and prepared them in the way that's necessary. You know the the the uh the the the the active ingredient if you take it from the the coffee plant will pass through your body without doing anything. The DMT the DMT the DT and then and then dimethylene and then you have the other ingredient which is a mayo inhibitor which is an an enzyme that blocks it defies explanation to some extent how the people without science came to it. How they how they they came to and he said if you ask the people how they do it they'll tell you that they go out into the forest at certain phases of the moon at night and the plants talk to them and they tell them. Now you you can dismiss that out of hand. You can just see that subsolute mumbo jumbo, but you're still left with the void of explaining how they've come, you know, to to bring these thing together, these things together in the way that they have to create this, you know, and he says the notion of plants talking to you by the light of the moon is not going to get you a degree in biology, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stammans. And to me it it opens up a vista of alternative ways of looking at the world and experiencing reality and and opening yourself up to the possibility that the way in which we make sense of it is not necessarily the only way. Yeah. Tim do you think scientism has become the such a dominant way to think you know the idea that science explains everything is is that is that limiting our humanity to some extent? I think so. Um I mean I was I was brought up Christian and actually rejected religion at one point and then now I've come to a point where I'm actually looking at uh how belief system but people a lot of people don't seem to believe in anything spiritually anymore. Um and and that kind of leaves a vacuum a hole which can be filled then by this science which is supposedly objective. And I think there's there's that there's a problem with that. And I think actually when you actually look at religions, there's a lot of wisdom baked in that have been handed down over the centuries. So even if you don't take the religion literally, um there's still a lot of useful things in the texts and wisdom that have been passed down over the years. Yeah. I don't like the idea of of uh an over reductionism uh in in humanity. to try and bring this back to some kind of reality though. I mean I used to work uh up until few well till I retired from academia. We were in an old building. It had been a workhouse. It had been a infirmary in the first world war. We've got pictures of all the nurses and doctors standing outside it. Innumerable numbers of human beings have suffered and died there. I used to sometimes work there late on my own at night. Nothing. No, no experience at all. I mean, when I was around the back of the building on my own late at night sorting stock out once, I thought I don't quite like it here. But there was nothing objective to I mean, have you experienced anything that you would think is weird? I have. I mean I have I have you know I had a a long way from here actually in the Kokos Islands in uh you know you know some of Australian territory out in the Indian Ocean and we had occasion to stay in a in a a house that had been the sort of uh epicenter of the had been the the HQ of the of the Scottish family that that that owned and ran the Coco Islands for some generations. And I definitely I woke up in the night in that house and I had an episode of what I mean I knew at the time that it was happening to me actually that kind of sleep paralysis. You know I woke up unable to move with an absolutely overwhelming sense of somebody else being in the room with me. And the sensation lasted as long as it lasted a few seconds I suppose. And then I was able to move again and I picked up my phone and I switched on the light and and so on and so there was and there was nobody there. But it was an it was a palpable physical experience. And and and on the one hand, while I was able to say to myself, ""Oh, that's that phenomenon that's known as sleep paralysis."" It nonetheless happened in in a house that was notoriously haunted. I mean, the local Sunni Muslim population didn't want to go anywhere near it because they associated it with that family who had actually made lives pretty miserable for for generations of of of of Sunni Muslim workers who had been on the who had been, you know, harvesting coconut trees for them. I've had I've had one or two occasions like that. In in re in reading around the subject for the book, I came across a bonafidey scientific research that has been undertaken by those who have sought to apply the scientific method to the supernatural to the paranormal. You because many people down through the down through the centuries have tried to do similar. Archie Roy, who was the who was the astronomer at Glasgow University, who helped the Apollo program work out the orbits for the for the moon landings. He spent the the latter part of his career in pursuit of what he called a sense of something strange. He spent a lot of his time investigating reports of paranormal activity, poltergeist activity, and he felt that while on the one hand, he was a man of science, he could also open his mind to to trying to address phenomena that people were were reporting. Um and this academic research that I'm talking about it it's it posits the notion that where people have experienced extremis either collectively maybe on a battlefield or maybe something dire that's happened to one individual in a place that the the talk is of an emotional residue that intense experience might leave something palpable behind. It's not all people, but some people depending on their subconscious, depending on their state of mind, might experience in much the same way that you can walk into a room wherein someone wearing perfume has walked out and you walk in and they're no longer there, but you can still smell the perfume because there and there there's a notion, you know, followed by and pursued by and and experimented on by people of a scientific bent who have suggested this notion, for example, of of residues left behind. I spoke to I had a I had a bizarre experience actually make which was hearing testimony directly uh from a woman who told me about uh her grandmother who lived uh in in during the Second World War in a cottage in either Devon or Dorsa I forget which now which county and late in life in in her 80s or I think she attended a a house party in the found herself overhearing a conversation that was being, you know, that was being enjoyed by half a dozen people. And it was a young couple and they were saying, they were telling the gathering how they'd had no option but to leave their rented cottage because of a haunting. And the the elderly lady, you know, I was I was I heard this from the from the granddaughter of this elderly lady. She realized that they were talking about the cottage that she had lived in during World War II. She they said the name of it and she thought and she she buted in. She said, ""I lived there. I lived in that house and it was never haunted. I didn't I didn't experience anything there."" And the couple said, ""It's haunted now."" And she said, ""Well, what is it that you're what are you experiencing?"" And they said that many, you know, not every night, but they'd be sitting in the sitting room and they would appear in front of them. and they could both see it was a young woman with her back to them and she was leaning against the wall beside the fireplace and banging her banging her head against the wall and then she would turn and face them and there would be blood. she would have bumped her head enough to to to make a and this they both saw it. They both saw it, right? They're unconnected to now the the elderly lady said I can't honestly remember if she said to them, but she certainly then reported back to her family. She said, ""During the war when I lived in that house, your grandfather was away in the war and I was bringing up a couple of kids or toddlers at the time, a baby and a toddler."" She said it was very difficult and her husband had contacted her and asked her to go through his papers to to to get some information that he needed. She'd gone through his briefcase, given him the information, but she had also found letters that revealed to her horror that he was had been having an affair. And she said she was with all of it. She was so broken by the news that she said several nights on the trot she had stood by the fire and she had indeed bumped her head against the wall enough to make it bleed. She'd never told anyone. It wasn't anything. She hadn't even remembered it really until it was brought back to her by this account. But to me, it meant that this young couple were being haunted by someone who was still alive. M now now you can you know you can you can spin all the caveats around that that you want that she made it all up that it was but the the the woman that I spoke to who had this from her grandmother said that she had no reason but to think that her mother the grandmother was telling the truth. Now that's that's an experience that's something that's happening that falls outside the purview of science but it's nonetheless something that was palpable to the people involved. Now I listen I listen to that as just a a witness you know just a listener and I think that's something worth talking about in all manner of ways the psychology of it the psych the the psychiatry of that what is the what is the explanation for that phenomenon the depth of the human experience is is there John what do you make of it it's really hard to say isn't it I mean I I've only had as I say I've been in a lot of places is where you might expect a phenomena, you know. I mean, I I used to walk through the the bowels of the old hospital, you know, taking patients to the morg, you know. I I used to when we moved into an old hospital, I used to park my park my bike in the morg and go out there late at night and and get it. Um, since I was 18, I've been taking patients to morgs and and I haven't experienced anything like that, but I have had one experience, and I haven't shared this before, but it's it's it's the only experience I've had. So um I would be about mid-40s at the time. I think it was about 44 and I was visiting the garden tomb in Jerusalem which was the site identified by General Gordon. Now I think we should say the garden tomb in Jerusalem is almost certainly not the the burial site of Christ. That is overwhelmingly likely to be the church of the holy separate. Well, there's there's certainly two locations that are that are advertised as the burial place of Jesus, and clearly one of them isn't. Yeah. So, yes. Yeah. So, so you got a location, although there is a Gol Gotha there, there is a skull there. There's a few things that indicate that it could be, but the the geologists seem the archaeologists seem fairly sure it's not, but there's a lovely garden there, and it was it closes at 4:30. It was nearly closing time, and uh I was the only person there, and I was about 20 yards away from the entrance of the tomb. And I looked to the tomb and inside the tomb. Around about the wall of the tomb, I saw the flash. And I noticed that the flash didn't go out the tomb. The flash was just in the tomb. There's like a line around the edge of the tomb where the flash was. I thought, ""Oh, someone's doing flash photography in the tomb."" But I thought it was a bit strange. So, I didn't take my eyes off it. I saw the flash and I walked straight towards it. Of course, the tomb was empty. And I thought, ""Just a minute. Just a minute, John. Just a minute. get this straight in your head. What have you just seen? Right? And they went through all in my head. And I said, I have just seen a flash inside the garden tomb in Jerusalem, which is almost certainly not the burial place of Christ, but I saw that flash. That definitely happened. And and then your wife came out the corner with a camera. No, no, she she wasn't actually there. Um I was I actually had a week in Israel myself. Uh she was looking after the kids at the time. Yeah, I know. But but what's your scientific scientifically? Scientifically the only explanation is an hallucination, but I've never hallucinated before or since. And I I simply can't explain it. I did talk to an old guy at church about it. And he said, ""Well, you know, may maybe the Lord was sending you some encouragement, you know, um and it came out of the tomb. Not not couldn't from like a skylight light."" No, that the flash was in the tomb. Okay. It lighted the inside of the tomb and it lighted the doorway of the tomb and it lasted for a flashbulb time. But I I know I saw it. You know, obviously obviously it makes a person who's familiar with the Christian story think about associate a a flash of of the reincarnation of the resurrection. You know, you would the resurrection. You would you would think that that what if that any uh suggestion of a of a dead person, a dead body being reanimated would involve you you would you would you would almost imagine that without being offered as as part of the story. You would imagine a light something you know the energy that that it would take to to restart you know like the electricity that it would take to reanimate a dead body and yet and that so it fits. So, you saw something in that location that you can contextualize in terms of that story. Yeah. But but it's not as though you're a profoundly devoutly religious person. Well, no, I am I am a Christian, but but but it's you weren't you weren't of a mind. I wasn't in a sort of a spiritual frame of mind. I had taken any illusions. I just I thought, ""Oh, it's time to go now."" And then just as I was I was about to leave. It was just just in in the couple of minutes before it closed. This is that's prec this is precisely what I'm talking about. It's especially interesting when you when you hear testimony like this from people who are only open-minded at most and quite often I've heard testimony from people who are quite openly skeptical about any of it which explains why they're you know it's only in the intimacy of you know a a long filming day standing in a location with somebody running out of things to talk about eventually people start dredging up all sorts of things that they probably haven't thought about for the longest time but quite often I've heard testimony like yours from people who will say, ""No, I don't believe in ghosts."" They'll preface it with that. I don't I don't believe in any of this. However, but they have to say that because of the current scientist's sort of paradigm. Yeah. It's there's a I believe, you know, to that that science has actually dumbed people down. Yeah. Or dumbed down their humanity, too. It's dumbed down the mass of the population because without a doubt, it has given for most people, science has given them the earth. It's given them technology. It's given them medicine. It's given them better lives, longer lives, better food, all of the rest of it. But very, very few people are scientists. And not even all scientists are particularly good at of switching on and applying the scientific method. It's a percentage of a percentage of people. And most people know next to nothing about anything. Correct. because they've been handed lives of convenience where they turn the key in their car and the magic of the internal combustion engine powers up or they go to their computer keyboard and they touch it and it goes from the you know it goes from their screen saver into their you know now they can do whatever they want and they've got a phone in their pocket but they don't understand any science. They've actually been they've not been made scientific. They're only the the the dumb beneficiaries of the gift of a tiny minority of people. That priesthood of scientists who do briefly and when they need to in the working day hold on to the outside of phenomena like electricity and electronics and computers and all of the rest of it. But and so most most people in the living in the at this point in the scientific era, not only do they have they have no meaning in their life because they've been stripped of religion, they've been stripped of belief and faith and spirituality and all of that. So there's a chasm, an emptiness for for most people. And people undoubtedly some people at sometimes experience things that simply aren't even appropriately explained by the scientific method. Yeah, there a whole people like Isaac Newton considered himself to be an alchemist for his entire working life. He he enjoyed he enjoyed mathematics and and and and writing the Principia really because in the way that a lot of people enjoy Suduku. It was a faintly distracting problem for him. He played with it. He was an alchemist. He wrote commenters on I think pretty well the whole Old Testament as well. Um who's um who's um Charles Darwin's alter ego that was that was Alfred Russell Wallace. He attended seances and and and believed that that that paranormal phenomenon should be investigated by scientists. You saw no reason why you wouldn't look at those phenomena with with a scientific approach. It's only relatively recently that people have been driven away from thinking about far less talking about a whole part of the texture of what it is to be human and alive. And it's it's aspects of being human and alive that aren't and shouldn't be explained by science. But at the very least, I would say we ought to up up upgrade the the grammar and the syntax and the vocabulary vocabulary that we might use to have those conversations because I think it would bring back to people the necessary meaning and the and the relief that comes from articulating some of what it feels like to be alive. Yeah. I mean, in psychology, we call this phenomenology, the the the psychology of the lived experience. What happens when you die? Well, I I think you are the worms that eat you basically. So like Right. So your consciousness ceases. Yeah. What you would But I don't think that that I think that was only an illusion in the first but yeah it was only an illusion in the first place. But there's a caveat is that if an illusion is powerful enough is does it become real? Because if there's no reality outside the illusion that the that the universe had to sort of create individuals to be able to look out of a little slit and see one point of view. Um if there's no re reality that's better than that subjective experience then you could say that it's not an illusion. So it's almost like a paradox. Okay. I mean for me I'm an individual. I'm a created individual. That that that is you like that before. No, I don't really know. But I mean, I'm listening to what you're saying, Tim, and that very undeniably or it would appear very clever people. you you know Plato you know who and he he wasn't the first to think it but you know he articulated this idea that the the the best version of you know if you think of a table right and you imagine the best table you can imagine you can and you can imagine what wood what material it's made of whether it's intricately carved whether it's very simp whatever you think about that that perfect table now is that what it is to be a table or is it one in in our world that you can actually touch. Is it the idea or the physical reality that is the best? And you know, play to imagine that the the the only real sphere, the only real circle was inhabiting a transcendent realm that that perfection was somewhere out of reach. That for the longest time, people were alive to the idea that the idea that which is in the transcendent is reality. And that what we have here is a poor is a poor faximile of that perfect real everything that exists in the transcendent realm. You know I you know Plato's cave. You know the idea of the people held captive you know looking at reflections on the wall in front of them and they can't turn around and they don't realize that what they're just what they're seeing are the shadows cast by people out in the real world but they don't know that. They think what they're looking at those dim shadows on the wall are real because it's the only thing they see. Now that idea that the real the better version of the best version of is always trans is exists in a realm that we cannot touch was the was the way that people thought for the longest time. We've been we have been beaten over the head with this that what we experience with our five senses is all there is. you to the point where people are embarrassed to vocalize any sense that there might be something else and I think that's I think that's inhibitory. I don't think that is enabling people but Nick Herbert who was a physicist he he was actually famous for writing the shortest um uh um uh formula for Bell's theorem. So he was a serious mathematician and physicist, but he also in the latter part of his life became interested in things transcendent and things paranormal and all of the rest of it. And he articulated a thought very effectively where he said that we live in a king Midas-like predicament in that everything we touch turns to matter. So we never actually touch the true texture of reality cuz just as you get in it just turns into solid and and all I'm saying is and all all I'm all I'm trying to open up in between the covers of that book is the idea that there are the full texture of reality and the full experience of what it is to be human and alive is not that which we taste, touch, see, smell and hear. There's more you we know all around us just now. There's there's there's infrared and ultraviolet. There's there's electricity. There's magnetism. There's all these things that we know are there, but that we and we take it for granted that we can't see. There's texts and emails pinging into our smartphones and our pockets, but we can't see them. And we we only become aware of them because the bit of kit in our pocket translates them into something that we can see. There's so I I believe there's so much more to what it is that we're we're only we're on a tiny island of matter in an infinite ocean of thought. And and another aspect is for that thought to exist there has to be a screen for it to be projected on a s of silence. Um like as we see all this stuff here or if if you look at the color black it can only exist if there was a a white to put it against or a contrast if that makes sense. And that's something that I think actually that is the mo that is the realization I had before I sort of had this let go experience. Um I say I but there was there was no way in that experience. It was this realization that there was this screen that had always been there that had got used to but had actually not noticed the screen that everything is projected on the paper that this experience is projected upon and that's an undeniable thing that that uh I think we all experience that that canvas of consciousness and you know studying medicine I thought I'd learn about this canvas of consciousness and that it's it's never been mentioned at any point we have a PCS scale to to measure how conscious Glasggo coma scale. Yeah. Glasggo coma scale. But but but there's no I don't think any scientists at least in the year I was studying medicine had a clue where this canvas of consciousness was coming from. And I think there there have been people now looking into that a bit more. Um, I've heard some good Rogan interviews uh with with scientists who have been actually trying to figure out what what what creates that canvas that we of the subjective where the subjective is um placed upon. So some mysteries still about around um so some um we have matter, energy, space and time. What is outside matter, energy, space and time? that which brought matter, energy, space and time into existence, the the the divine. In Christianity, that is what God did. Um different opinions of that. Another mystery is where life came from. Another mystery is what the heck is consciousness. Uh we don't really know, but we do know it's something very special. And if you're experiencing it, you're part of this human in in my view created experience. And that makes you pretty special. Remember that you are a special created conscious being and we live in a complicated rich experience of humanity that we need to share and empathize with each absolutely other Tim thank you thank you very much John Neil thank you and how much is this Neil it's quite cheap is it I have absolutely no idea about 10 quid or something it's retailing in all good bookshops for the princely sum of 25 of your earth pounds I think I think you can get it cheaper than that on on various but uh time plays in history. Fascinating stuff. Such a refreshing change from pure science and pure medicine. Thank you. Thank you, John.",0.045,0.864,0.091,0.9999
X86XRh-JMQs,10172,361,11,Catherine And William Share Sweetest PDA Moments During Emotional Reunion In Scotland,20250525,"The Prince and Princess of Wales reunited in a touching display of affection as they stepped off a private jet and into each other's arms. Capturing the kind of real life fairy tale that royal fans live for. Wearing a bespoke navy outfit by Susanna London paired with a matching wide-brimmed hat, Catherine was the embodiment of modern royalty. polished, poised, and powerful. As she descended the steps of the jet, all eyes were drawn not just to her fashion, but to the radiant smile that lit up when she locked eyes with William. Prince William, ever the gentleman, was waiting below beside their signature black Range Rover. As Catherine approached, he gently placed a hand on her back, guiding her with quiet affection. What followed was a rare but deeply cherished public display of affection. The future king and queen briefly embraced, and William leaned in, speaking softly into her ear with a smile that spoke volumes. Royal observers and fans couldn't help but notice the natural chemistry between the couple. In a world where royal decorum often overshadows emotion, these candid moments felt refreshingly authentic. Catherine was visibly glowing, and William, ever protective, kept a close and loving watch over her as they made their way to their waiting vehicle. Prince William and Princess Catherine lit up the Scottish skies with warmth, wit, and charm during their recent visit to Glasgow for the official naming ceremony of HMS Glasgow, an event that was part tradition, part diplomacy, and all heart. The day was brimming with royal elegance and human moments that stole the show. None more so than a brief but delightful exchange that quickly went viral online, proving once again that the future king and queen aren't just dignified, they're downright lovable. In another moment, as Catherine and William walked along the crowd line, greeting the hundreds who had gathered to witness the historic ceremony, one fan broke protocol in the most delightful way. You're beautiful,"" they shouted toward the princess. Before anyone could blink, the same admirer quickly followed with, ""You too, William,"" sparking laughter all around. Never missing a beat, Prince William turned with a cheeky grin and responded, ""You don't have to say that. Don't worry."" It was a fleeting moment, but it perfectly encapsulated why the public loves them. Unscripted, down to earth, and full of personality. William's playful humility paired with Catherine's gracious smile created a feel-good snapshot that spread like wildfire on social media. Adding to the warmth, Prince William placed a gentle hand on Catherine's arm as they walked away. A subtle but tender gesture that sent royal fans into a frenzy. Princess Catherine stepped into her ceremonial role with the same grace and confidence that have become her signature. As the official sponsor of HMS Glasgow, she led the ship's naming ritual, a naval tradition steeped in history. Dressed in a stunning navy ensemble with bold white trim, Catherine looked effortlessly elegant, pairing her look with a matching wide-brimmed hat that added a classic regal flare. She delivered a short but meaningful speech before performing the ceremonial bottle smash, replacing champagne with a fittingly Scottish touch, a bottle of single malt whiskey. With a button press, the bottle was released onto the hull of the ship, marking the moment HMS Glasgow was officially named. The gray stealth-like type 26 frigot is the first of eight advanced anti-ubmarine ships to be built in the city, playing a crucial role in the UK's future naval capabilities. After the ceremony, the royal couple toured the vessel's internal structure, currently being fitted out by BAE Systems. They spent time with ship builders, engineers, apprentices, and members of the ship's company, taking a genuine interest in the work behind this next generation warship. But it wasn't all speeches and handshakes. At a nearby training center, William and Catherine were invited to try their hands at a STEM activity popular with secondary school students. The challenge, assemble a functioning copper pipe network as quickly as possible. What began as a collaborative exercise quickly turned into playful competition. William, unaware it was a race, was caught off guard when told his wife had already taken the lead. ""It's a race? That's fine. Then I'll race,"" he said with a laugh, prompting chuckles from both Catherine and the apprentices supervising the task. When Catherine was declared the winner, William jokingly questioned the outcome. Her effort was wobbly. It was a scene straight out of a romcom. Cheeky banter, mutual encouragement, and a glimpse into the fun dynamic that has helped make their relationship so relatable and admired around the world. This visit wasn't just about ceremony. It was about connection. The HMS Glasgow represents innovation, security, and the future of British defense. But it was the royal couple who brought heart to the occasion. From Catherine's symbolic smashing of the whiskey bottle to their playful public exchange with well-wishers, every moment felt real, unfiltered, human. It's that rare balance between tradition and authenticity that William and Catherine continue to master with quiet confidence. And in doing so, they don't just fulfill royal duty, they inspire a nation.",0.021,0.741,0.238,0.9997

We understand there's uh pet dog updates for both the Queen and the Wales. Well, yeah, it's gone thick and fast this week because uh first of all, we had a new picture of the Queen's new dog, Molly, called as such because apparently he looks like a mole.

It's really about the tension between Parliament and the monarchy. Mr. speaker. All the more appropriate because for the opening of the 45th session of Parliament, the king himself will read the speech as opposed to the governor general who typically represents the crown. On the big day, all eyes are on the usher of the Black Rod, a senior parliamentary protocol officer who plays a pivotal role, including inviting the MPs to the Senate to hear the speech. And that is where the drama begins. Usher of the black rod is just getting close to the doors of the House of Commons. Those doors will be slammed shut in the face of the usher. And this is symbolic. Incredibly rude. Yes, it can be incredibly rude. It is the House of Commons demonstrating their independence from the [Music] crown. At which point the usher knocks. Speech after speech. There's always been three knocks at the door. So, what's with the closed doors and the knocking? Well, it goes back to the 17th century and a king who didn't respect the independence of the house. During the 17th century, there was a major power struggle between the crown and parliament. During the reign of Charles I, Parliament felt that its rights were being circumscribed and that the king was acting arbitrarily. And then in 1642, things really took a turn. In the leadup to the English Civil War, Charles I brought soldiers and what went into the floor of the then English House of Commons seeking to arrest Oliver Cromwell, John Pim, and three other senior parliamentarians who to the king were threatening a civil war which in part brought about the English Civil War and the execution of King Charles I. Who rules England? A king or Parliament? The Civil War decided. The answer is Parliament. Which brings us back to the usher of the Black Rod, who as the crown's representative must knock and request permission before entering the House of Commons. The key point here is Black Rod cannot simply barge in and demand that the Commons come to hear the speech. Black Rod has to ask to be admitted and the comments have to agree that they will come. Not all Black Rods are the same. The original was lost in the parliamentary fire of 1916. The replacement was snapped in half in 1967 and glued back together. After all the wear and tear, a new rod was restored as a gift for the queen in 2016. And that it is time for them to attend. Once the MPs follow the usher of the Black Raw to the Senate, you may notice another object that's part of the procession, the mace. Going back to medieval times, the maze was a weapon, a weapon of war to defend initially the king and then then it became appropriated by the House of Commons. The mace is important because it represents uh royal authority. The mace has to be present in the room for either house to conduct business. We resume one day. In fact, in the British Parliament during the Brexit debates, one MP put this to the test, grabbing the mace. He didn't get very far with the royal robes and rods and maces. It might be tempting to see these traditions as relics from the past, but historians say if anything, they're more relevant than ever. At this particular time in the world when democracy um legal rights are under challenge in many countries I think it's very important for us to remember that we have these rights and why we have these rights that people died to secure these rights for us and that we should appreciate them.

And all of these uh all of the links are in the show notes of every single episode I put out. So, look forward to uh continuing to um you know provide great conversations and thank you all for your continued support. [Music] I said we were talking about Mission Impossible right right before I hit the record button. It's like let's get this in here, too. People get pissed, but who cares? This is it's good to talk about movies. Shake off the shake off the They are intensely political movies, especially the ones written by Chris McCquory or for those of you who don't know like I follow this this crap because you know I care. Like Chris McCory, the first thing that everybody would know anything about him would be he's the guy who wrote The Usual Suspects. Oh, that was a good movie. [ __ ] a great movie. A great great ending. It's a great writer. And I just found it really interesting. I didn't realize that um I knew that and he's written a bunch. He and Cruz have written have done a lot of work together. Um, and but uh what I found really interesting is I remember watching uh Rogue Nation, which was the first one he wrote and directed, which is number five for those of you who are keeping track. Um, and it's where the first time we ever saw Rebecca Ferguson in a real Oh my god, she's amazing. Um, that movie is really dense and really interesting in terms of how deeply you watch all of the intelligence agencies fighting amongst themselves. And the plot of that movie, the more I I I was watching it again last night and the and I was reminded of just how devious all of the various intelligence agencies of the West are. The CIA versus the IMF versus the MI6 versus this one. It It's really really good. And then it only gets They're really like crime syndicates, right? They're really like crime syndicates. They really are, especially They really are. And and it's really fascinating. Um I that like like the whole McCory storyline that starts in Rogue Nation and works all the way through Syri the first the last three and now the one that's just come out. So I'm going to see MIA on for on Sunday and I just set it up with my my family. Looking forward to it. I've the I've w been watching these movies now for a while like and I find myself going why do I like these so much? I'm like, ""Oh, it's because the politics are all right and they've been a little ahead of the curve over the last 15 years."" Can you You've said this now a couple of times. Can you say exactly how the politics are right for you and and what they are? Oh, I think that I think he's I think they're absolutely trying to explain to us what the freaking problem is. Like if you haven't watched MI7, the the the bad guy is an AI a rogue AI and it's literally them running working against the more the ever more perfect technocratic union of something like the European Union like but with the AI being a a proxy for that kind of thing. I think, you know, I I saw it then as I was watching MI7. I've watched that movie three or four times. And and six is, you know, five and six are about rogue intelligence assets trying to remake the world. Um trying to burn down the old world because they've been betrayed by their governments and now and trying to usher in, you know, a new age through well um extreme suffering. And uh it's really fascinating. Where where does the Tom Cruz character fit in? Well, he of course is on the side of he's on the side of like trying to like see the those movies are all this is it's it's those four movies where Ethan Hunt played by Tom Cruz always chooses saving people and trying to trying to preserve life. That's his main focus is always to preserve life. And so that's his ethos. And that means that the plots get incredibly convoluted as he tries to work his way out of these insanely difficult puzzles that have been placed in front of him in order to in order to not only save the world but save all the people. And I find it, you know, and I find them and then as the series have gone has gone along personally, all the stakes for him keep rising as people as the the villains keep forcing him to choose when he doesn't want to. And so they're really quite well done from from a I wouldn't ordinarily find myself in a movie theater at this time of year on Memorial Day weekend, but since it's going to be rainy and 50° all weekend, maybe maybe I'll actually do it. I if you haven't seen I would but I would really absolutely you need to watch MI7 first because it's part one of the last the last two films together are one big set. So MI7's on Prime for free right now. Go ahead and watch it. It's two and a half hours. It's worth your time. They're all actually on they're all actually available other than five I think is the only one that's not available on Prime right now for free. So I just saw the first two. I saw one and two and I haven't I heard they get better. Is three good too? They got they got so much better. So like one was fine. two two the John Woo movie wasn't very good and I left them I left them for dead until I saw Mi5 like I didn't see another one until I I we went to see Mi5 in the theaters because I think it was like the only thing out I just thought felt like watching a movie and um and then I'm watching those I'm watching five and six and I'm like I don't even understand the plot points and I go back and re and then we went back and rewatched them all and I'm like h there is one big there is one nice long form story here uh as it as it plays out from um from a from his perspective, Tom Cruz's perspective. So there is very much continuity in that respect and they've done a credible job, but at the end of the day, they really are, you know, eye candy certainly. They are stuntfest. So I'm not going to argue that, but they're really well done for what they are and and they actually elevate slightly above what they purport to be, I think. And I that's why people like them so much, guys. They're they're they're quite good. So yeah, I've been I've been finding myself talking about the movie Falling Down a bunch uh bunch of my conversations over the last week and and that movie has so much Who's the lead in that? Michael Douglas. Michael Douglas. Yeah. Yeah. Where he he he loses his mind basically. Well, he plays some bureaucratic schmo who finally loses his who finally breaks. Yeah. And uh goes on a spree around Los Angeles on foot, I guess, mostly just bashing people around. It's um I remember seeing it when it first came out. Um my as I said we said off camera, Mike brought it up earlier. I haven't I think I've watched it once since I saw it in the theaters. I haven't seen it. I've been meaning to watch it again recently, but it's u because it's it's it's a at this point it's definitely a meme movie. Um and you know, Michael Douglas plays a guy who whose name we never learn, right? uh who just snaps and goes around LA and he's like and it's like the it's like the first movie that really embraced the idea that we we're losing our culture and we're losing our sense of we're losing our sense of everything. Um it really is about that. Speaking of which, I was watching um Tucker Carlson interview I've gota I've got I'm going to do an insert here. Tucker Carlson interview Sean Ryan. That was on May 19th and there was this funny part where Sean Ryan said, ""Everything is bullshit."" Tucker Carlson says, ""What do you mean by everything?"" And he says, ""Everything."" And I'm going, ""That's pretty much true."" Now, the reason I was watching, I've been binging a little more Tucker than usual because I was actually supposed to be on Tucker on May 19th and uh and and then I got displaced by Ryan. So, I said, ""There must be something good here."" It it didn't I thought there'd be something timely where Tucker said, ""Okay, gotta call an audible at the line. Boom. Substitute in Ryan. Column can go, you know, suck eggs until 1st June and now July, it turns out."" Um, but there was nothing special. Nothing I could see that was timing. And I I thought it was kind of boring. It was kind of Yeah, he was he didn't have much to say other than, you know, he was he was disgruntled in 117 different ways. But the everything everything is [ __ ] caught my attention because it it just feels that way. There's not a narrative out there that you can't say I I think that's [ __ ] I I had a friend I had a friend Sorry, Jim. Go ahead. Well, I think that the the one position that remains in that is that you can see through the [ __ ] and then that's the problem.

You know, I think all three of us, all four of us see through the [ __ ] Although Mike has turned so dark about everything, it's all [ __ ] to to Mike. Well, no, I the Sean Ryan I I had a friend call me. I didn't watch it, but he said that his life was so like the story you you can't even believe it. Like you almost wonder if is is his story of Shawn Ryan manufactured? story is interesting, but but the place that he's landed, he he's just not that articulate. He may he may be good at at uh reading his guests and answering the asking them good questions, but he's not very good at explaining where he stands. He's top four in terms of total viewers, I think. Yeah. And I haven't seen his his podcast very much, so I don't know. But I I suppose he's good at at uh you know, I think he gets good people. I think he gets good people. Yeah. You know, unlike Mike who's bringing in the drags, the same losers. Losers. Same. Yeah. Just a bunch of It's like leftovers. Oh, really? You got to heat the lasagna again. Fair enough. Yeah. Except a lot of people like leftover lasagna. No. And you wonder And then you wonder why second day, right? I was going to say then you wonder why Mark's Mike's so dark about everything. Right. I know. I know. The three of us ruined them is another way of putting it. Well, like again, my friend said with Char. Okay. We have a real [ __ ] problem when I'm the optimist in the bunch. Yes. Yes. Yes. I thought that was me. No. Well, but hey, let let's get back on the what is reality track. Pretend we're the fire sign The theater. I know. Oh, Dave's not here. Um, a classic. Um, I've been, you know, so, so my wife is constantly telling me about things Trump's that this Trump's doing that's really awful. And I go, ""How do you know it's true?"" Right? I keep coming back to the how do you know it's true? She's getting told all sorts of things. And, you know, here here's examples that I've heard. You know, I heard rumor that some grad student got kicked out of Princeton chemistry for jaywalking or something, right? And got sent home, right? So, I called called a friend or I emailed a friend who was a former colleague who's not princon. He said, ""Oh, it's much more nuanced than that. He was doing all sorts of [ __ ] up stuff."" Um, I've been told by someone who's collaborating with a friend at Harvard chemistry and they say that these prominent guys, these are really prominent guys are being told wrap up your program in the next two years because Harvard doesn't want to take any money out of their endowment to keep their their show going. You know, endowments are funny things that it they're they're so legally cordoned off. So, an endowment is not a big funible pot of money. So, when you know, David Einhorn donated 50 million to Cornell, but he donates it to do something and you can't legally do something else. Now, Stanford made the mistake years ago of actually not watching those dotted lines carefully and and someone was able to trace their their their donation or or they were able to trace federal dollars to the to the Harvard president um putting cedar lining in his closet, right? And it became this scandal, right? But but but that just meant that Harvard that Stanford just didn't was not rigorous about keeping the money in in their in their silos and and I I doubt there was no there was no corruption. It was just a sloppiness. So what do you make of the Harvard situation? I I don't know because I don't know what to believe. I I I mean these are guys like at least one of them is a potential Nobel Prize winner and he's he's being told wrap up your group in the next two years. because of money or or because of the nine billion I guess. Okay. And Trump's now attacking him saying um saying that, you know, he's he's going at their tax exempt status. I watched a disturbing exchange between um Elizabeth Warren and the head of the IRS which he kept reading a rule that says according she read it verbatim that says the IRS that no one can tell which includes the president no one can tell the IRS which taxpayers to be audited. Now we know they did that with with Biden, right? We know that. But forget about that the fact we know that, right? they went after all the conservative groups. Um but but let's say we don't care about that. Um and and the guy couldn't handle it. All he had to do is say, ""Well, let's start with the fact that Harvard's not a taxpayer, so that doesn't apply to them."" So I'm listening to this going, ""So Trump's telling him to make them a taxpayer."" And and then uh and then the other thing is um the other thing is is is the he didn't tell them to audit them. So the the word audit and taxpayer were the two outlets for the IRS commissioner. And he's he's like Homeman. Homeman is the right guy for Homeman's job. He is not the right guy to be the IRS commissioner. And this guy was like Homeman. He was like dumber than a brick. And so, you know, obviously bought his way into that position. Um no one will ever be lowest learner in that position though. So um um so I don't know what's going on. This is again this is my home field advantage. So as as I was getting ready to sort of go sit down with Tucker um I actually sent an email off to our president who's happens to be a friend also and said is there something you'd like unofficially um unofficially um discussed that's not official Cornell policy but you'd like to get out there. He sent me a bullet that listed some things that that we've done, for example, and we've asked like 70 kids to take a hike off the campus for being too disruptive and things like that. And um so I can't tell quite tell it's going. It seems obvious to me that um that some percentage of what Trump's doing where they're talking about um where where they're talking about taking away um taking away the federal money specifically to Cornell Harvard and one other it's it's because they haven't fought anti-semitism that seems like it's Apac flexing its muscles. Um but but but they've also supposedly cut off all the grants. Now, since I wrapped up my program, again, I'm not paying as close of attention as I should, but they they supposedly cut off all the funding to all the major agencies that fund universities. And go ahead. What I was going to say is I was watching the thing with Bill Aman this morning. I didn't get a chance to watch the whole thing and I I meant to meant to get back to it, but I was really busy where he was going over, you know, um the idea that, you know, Harvard's what $51 billion endowment or whatever. um that all too much of it in his opinion is tied up in private equity um venture capital and everything else is tied up in a lot of investments that when he know he is convinced is does not does not have a 51 mill billion dollar book value. Oh, marked the marked a myth is a big problem now, right? And that's and I think that may be part of what's going on here. And you know, um, that may be a secondary thing. Well, that's a secondary thing because that's but but but here and I'm not defending the so so here's here's my stance. The universities needed a bad wakeup call. They needed a fast ball right past their chin, right? There's no question. We'd gone super woke and there was a lot of [ __ ] Here's something I'll tell you and I don't want to pick on my own. You know, Cornell's ranked number one in the in the country of having the largest number of top 10 ranked departments in the country. We have 57, right? We're really very good at that. Um, our English department has 48 tenure tenure track faculty. Now, you now take away journalism, which is basically extinct, right? put it this way, journalism of the kind that requires you be able to write. Um, you take away you take away um all the writing that the sort of manual writing chores because you've got AI and you say crank it, edit it, move it on, right? So, you're at great risks there. So, you're not training people to write. If I were teaching an English course, I'd be getting computer written papers for my course, right? Um, and it would drive me nuts. I actually was going to teach a freshman writing seminar and I said, ""No, not doing it now."" Um, and yet we have 48 English professors. That means we've got 48 guys studying things like Chaucer. And what I'll tell you is you can't pay $300,000 a year and study Chaucer unless you come with a trust fund, right? And colleges are no longer about kids with trust funds, right? They used to be about kids with trust funds more. And so I think the liberal arts education is probably anacronistic. That's my guess that my if if if there if there's someone from Cornell or someone in the on the arts quad right now listening. I'm not saying this poratively, but but but but we are at the point now where you know there's no more Henry Blah. It's where you get an English major and then go make millions on Wall Street. That that's a fictional character now, right? And and so you can't just say, ""Look, you get the sheepkin from Cornell, you'll be you'll have it made."" No, you won't. If you study the wrong stuff, if you learn the wrong skills, you will not have it made. Now, the trust fund, the the um the endowment story is a is one that that it drives me nuts because people don't understand it at all. And that is it's these siloed allocations of money. What I did notice was a stat that showed that 48% of all the the the the money that's spun up on the endowment goes to financial aid. That means it goes to all the kids who can't afford college, right? And and then another 20 25% are for academic things. And it's a stunningly small amount that that that's got a label that you might say, well, you could trim that, right? You know, that sort of thing. So um so during 089 before it really got redot but it was starting to if you were paying attention I was sitting in my office with the vice provost of Harvard and he actually said in a moment of clarity which I think he was spilling his guts in a way he probably should not have been. He said we don't know how we're going to make payroll this month and it's the liquidity problem which you mentioned in terms of private equity. Now the universities are talking about getting rid of their private equity. I think they they're there are smart people here and they're saying this private equity is going to be a nightmare that the next crisis is going to have private all over where there's private debt or private equity. It's going to have crisis everywhere going to be private everywhere. Melody Wright is going to be private and I think the universities are trying to sneak out the back door the endowments. But it means that every other goddamn pension fund and stuff. So now they're trying to sell private equity to retail investors. Excuse me. That that that they're offloading the risk on the stupidest people in the room. Yeah, that's bucket shop behavior all over. That's bucket shot behavior. And so so that means it's over, right? That means it's game over. Private equity is done. And they're illquid. They don't mark to market and and and I know that these pensions that should have a ton of the crap and there's so many fees involved. So, we've been getting ripped off. I mean, it's it private equity is total bucket crap, bucket shop [ __ ] So, so so so the universities are in in in an odd situation where they're hated and some of it's right, but some of it's wrong. And and sure, uh I was kind of and I've been asking administrators why why don't we have people out on the circuit saying, ""Let me explain to you what an endowment is. Let me explain to you what overhead is. They say, 'Why do you need 62%. Right? And I go, well, I can explain it. Trivia, Tom, you'll understand this. If you take the chemistry building, you say, ""Look, what percentage is teaching? What percentage is research?"" It turns out it's about twothirds research. If you take what we bring in in overhead, we do not pay 2/3 of the of the utility bill because we send the air from the chem building out the stacks every two minutes. Imagine heating your house and air conditioning your house doing that. Mhm. And so it and it turns out a huge percentage of stuff going to fizer and merc and stuff you know drug lead candidates and stuff huge percentage of finds their roots from university research. It is a system we set up on purpose. Now didn't have to be set up that way. It could be changed. It could be it's not working or something which I I don't think it's failed. If I applied for an NIH grant in under normal circumstances, I'd have a one in 10 one in 20 chance of getting funded. Well, I mean 10 or 20% chance of getting funded. That's that's that's that's Darwinian, right? This this is not, oh, we all just wallow in money. This is you're getting your your ass slapped purple every [ __ ] application. Which is now why I'll point out that I went 21 in a row getting funded. [Laughter] That's a one and 10 to the 15th probability. So, so I'm a little confused by what I'm confused by what Trump's trying to achieve. Could be, you know, the fourth turning discussion could be that this is not just him throwing a fast ball past the chin. This is forth turning. Tear down institutions, NATO here, universities here, right? it. Jim's had his hand up for a while, so go ahead. Um, looking at this from a slightly different angle. Um, first of all, in the elite Ivy League schools, you have a kind of a different situation than all the others. Uh, because they they have been combination gentleman's finishing schools and elite research institutions for quite a while, for our lifetime really. Um, you know, before then they were pretty much uh uh gentleman's finishing schools. Um but they have that dual quality. Um and they're but but all of the universities have uh one essential deep deep problem now which is that they have been way overly politicized and in a very unappetizing way. You know it's it's not the 60s all over again. It's something quite a bit worse. you know, uh, uh, and it's so inverted and and perverse, you know, in the sense that, uh, wokery and DEI became literally reverse racism and and that's insidious and and awful. So, I agree with 100% of what you just said. So, I think that what Trump is doing is giving is whacking him upside the head with a fungal bat, telling them that they better get unpolitical fast, especially in this way. And and you know, they don't have to be political. It's it's been we take it for granted now that that uh college professors and and students all have to be activists in one way or another. I mean, it's become insane part of the program, but it's totally insane. And I think that the message from Trump is no, you're not supposed to be activists. You're supposed to be training young minds how to think and how to perform professionally. And so there's that angle which I think is important and separate and also to separate the Ivy League schools from everything else is important because you know the Ivy League schools are are as we've been saying you know in one way or another you know apart from the private equity problem and the quality of their investments they're much richer than everybody else but you have these thousands and thousands of lesser schools ranging from the major state unities ities down to all the little small colleges and small liberal arts schools and and community colleges. And I'm convinced that they're toast. They are not going to I think we might save we might save the community colleges and core out the middle. But you know, I don't think that they're going to be much more than than advanced BoseI schools when that happens. I would agree with you about that. That's a word I haven't heard in a long long time. What is that word in New York State? Boseies. I don't know what the I forget what the acronym represents, but what it means is we teach this is vocational training. You know, how to run bulldozers, how to be a cook, how to do all of these useful things and piping, welding. Yes. But I think the state universities are going to lose so much of their enrollment and and so and they're you know they've been through I went around the state universities as a lecture because of my urban design books back in the late 90s and early 2000s and the building programs that were underway in places like Michigan State and the University of Iowa or Iowa State, whichever one, you know, all of them. the building programs alone were so feronic and grandiose and insane, you know, uh that I just don't see any chance that they're going to survive operating at the scale that they thought they were going to be operating at. So, that's what I think. I think they're they're toast. They're going down and and you know what will remain will be professional training uh and um but you know, vocational training. Can I can I ask before we before we we get off on this, I think there's two other points to to to note here. First, that um I think we should realize that there's a political angle to this that's very very real. One, there's um a major reason why a lot of people have come from overseas to come here to study in order to spy on the on the country. And I think that's very important. I think we should also realize that that our Ivy League schools unfortunately have the reputation of being intelligence service recruitment schools as well. And I think that that's there's a national security angle to this I think is very that's very real. I'm not saying you know and you have you have Stanford being in bed with the with the CCP for decades. Exactly. So, we have a lot of that going on and I hate to and I I'm I'm not making I I'm I'm adding that into all the other things that have been said here because I I'm now at the same time I live in a very I live in a state that has way too much money. I live in Florida. I got news for you. The University of Florida is built has tripled the size of the physics department. They tripled the triple the the number of buildings. We were we were woefully underprepared as an engineering and and STEM school. We were un woefully under um we had the the woefully out of date infrastructure and they've b built unbelievable amounts of [ __ ] in the last every time I go to campus I'm like what are we building now and I'm like us the new physics building like holy [ __ ] and they're not building they're not adding on to Turlington which is the which is the liber which is the seat of the college of liberal arts and sciences no the the chemistry department has four buildings now when I was there they they had just built their second right so what we're what we're dealing with is is I think that the money is going to have to get shifted towards where it we we need it to go. And I think that the major universities are going to go back to being training grounds for professionals in the fields where you need to go to college to be able to I I just think we're going to be we're going to be re um rebalancing that money in kind of classic Austrian economics ar style argument of away from malinvestment in you know I hate to put it this way underwater basket weaving as my dad would put and back into chemistry, physics, and engineering and medical and all the rest of it. And you know, and that's that's where the hiring is at UF. And I can say and I see it. My my daughter got a job at the at the the college of the the department of dermatology. Harried her off the street as a 19-year-old, as an 18-year-old because they needed, you know, technicians. and um you know they'll train her up and and if she's good at she's good at what she does she'll they'll train her up and they'll make her into a permanent employee. That's but we have so much money in Florida they almost don't know what to do with it all. And so we're we're seeing um there means they're giving out really good scholarships to average students in a way that we that I hadn't seen when I was you know I haven't seen in the entire time I've been here. you know, it the state has the money to send the kids to college and um and to underwrite um and to underwrite the uh the education of of uh of the next generation of kids. And it depends, but again, it depends on the state. The bigger problem is whether or not the the big question we should all be asking is whether that that money that we tell pull out of taxes should go in to the federal government. How the federal government take its 35 to 75% cut and then to distribute the rest of it out to the to the universities that way. That's the question. How should the funding though? Should it happen at the state level? Should it happen at the federal level? You know, should it happen at the local level? I don't know. But I can tell you that where where we have money, ain't no worry about the University of For example, the University of Florida or even I mean even Santa Fe which used to be a community college. We used to have UF and Santa Fe in Gainesville because Santa Fe was a two-year community college. It is now Santa Fe College and it is a full-blown univer It is a full-blown four-year school that has 35,000 students. When I went to the University of Florida in the 80s, our enrollment was 35,000. Now you have the 75 to 80,000. Okay? Like you're going to ask yourself the question whether or not 110,000 kids a year should be going to college in Gainesville or not. That's I would ask myself the question, what what possible jobs are they going to land in? Well, so this I would argue that's and I would argue that same point. So now we have to if we but the problem with politics is the problem with money and politics is just money in politics. problem with education the money in education is there's money in education like it's the same thing you know you underwrites if you subsidize something you get more of it in that respect I so agree with Ron Paul and so if we stop subsidizing then we have to decide where our priorities lie I think nature is going to stop subsidizing western civ and you know that that's what I would base some of my expectations on fair enough a friend of mine's son just uh went for a semester in Ohio like a a mid- American American school, you know, 20,000 25,000. He he went for a seme he went for one semester and pronouns that was in the classes and then one of the uh professors gave everybody off a week to heal after Trump got reelected. Yeah, you're paying. So, so, so, so, so, so of all the Trump achievements, the one that was most dramatic was the knocking the wind out of the woke movement. That was the big thing. That was so instantaneous. That was so instantaneous. But people are goddamn sick of it. But they're still doing it though at the universities. It hasn't stopped. And they're going to be punished for it. They're That's right. They're going to be punished for it. The the the way things happen, Mike, is like everything else. Things don't things aren't state. Societal change isn't a state function. We don't go from on to off. They aren't diodes, you know. They are curves. They are processes. They are cycles. You hit your peak and then you start moving over. And we tend to focus on and we're good at it seeing the shifts. You know, you see that the you see this shift in the acceleration rate and to use it mathematic terms. Woke was positive acceleration and then it hit its peak, hit zero and now it's on the way down. But there's going to be places where it's still it's like putting out a forest fire. You're going to find patches of burning [ __ ] the firemen got to get to. I I saw I saw a web page of one of Cornell's bio departments. We have we have 500 and something biologically related faculty. 500 and something. And um and the website was it was like five paragraphs straight on woke. It wasn't just a a a you know a declaration at the top of the page. It really was it really sounded like it came out of gender studies or something. And uh so that stuff will take a while to clean out. Uh the Harvard University professor uh excuse me, president stood up on national news and he got interviewed and he somehow chose instead of to defend the research role of Harvard and the $9 billion, he said that we can't give up on DEI. Is this Garber? I don't know his name. At least he's not at least not Clotting Gay. Um, and um, and I'm thinking you you got $9 billion being jammed up your ass and you decide that you're going to actually fight that fight, which is not going to win. That's that's remarkably foolish. Um, well, you know, you know, it it does speak to their ridiculous sense of entitlement. And what what's curious to me is that uh a lot of the DEI hires who became the diversity deans uh act as privileged as the old Wasp uh plutoaucracy of old. You know, they they just instantly kind of uh segueed right into that kind of behavior with no problem. Well, Douglas Murray before destroying his career in one fell swoop um um was making the case that we're all laughing about how they wouldn't get jobs and they all got jobs. He goes, ""Holy [ __ ] I didn't see that coming."" Right? So well you know like for the the funny part about watching this period of history u as it's played out over the last seven months is that it's really obvious that whose underru are showing and be like Nigel Farage has now came out that he's fully city of London same thing with Douglas Murray like you can just see is MI6 at at the end of the day that's my clarity like everything to me is like it's really obvious you know it's like NAS they're like all NASCAR drivers now and they're just like sticking like advertisements on who they work for and I can just I don't know about you guys but I can just see it everywhere and and to Dave Dave your point originally that it's all [ __ ] Yeah. I'm like it's all fake and gay. This is what I've been saying for a while now. You know the all [ __ ] was so drilled up our asses when Kosh Patel and Banino sat up there and said Jeffrey Epstein hung himself. That was a very curious. You could also you could also look at them and go they also look like guys who were going through a struggle session. Like they look to me like they were like like they were scared of something like they got but that that's that's that same as like saying that JFK was killed by Oswald, right? There's no reason to say it, right? There was no reason. I would say that they do have a reason for saying it. We just don't know what it is. Right. We don't know what it is. Tom. Well, you know, Tom and Dave, when you mentioned, you know, we know where those people uh got their jobs, you know, after they uh went through the affirmative work for I I'd have to point out that how important it was that Trump disassembled the USID matrix because the the thousands and thousands of NOS's that were created out of that awful swamp of of of idiocy supported the entire leftist activist um core and in great style in in high style with pardon. We do we do we know it's gone? It's pretty well gone and and and it's been disassembled and uh you know now Marco Rubio is nominally in charge of USA ID but and um you know they haven't really started any serious as far as I know serious criminal inquiries but they are there waiting to be uncovered. Samantha Power for one you know who ran US ID and create helped to erect this armature of fraud that went on but those jobs are not there anymore. They don't have a conduit to that kind of comfort and security anymore. And you know, they're going to just be street thugs now. Well, what I would say what I would say to Dave's worried whether or not it's been truly dismantled or not is what I would say is they're all everybody who was formerly supported by this are are all the ones screaming. You can just see thing. You can I can see it every I don't know I don't know about you guys but I I can't like even give a chapter and verse at this point but every time I look around I'm like oh yeah there's another one who just lost their lost their money there's another one there's another one there's another they're everywhere and it's and I think that the department of education I think there some of the stuff in DoD like every one of the government departments what we're finding is that Medicaid like one of the things that came out the other day in the in the in the House version of the big beautiful tax bill budget reconciliation bill that went was that they inserted at the last moment which really burned Elizabeth Warren's tits. So that made me very happy which was um that they they found $800 billion dollar worth of outright [ __ ] Medicaid fraud to get rid of and it's all Medicaid to illegal immigrants that they were and then what happens is that that gets turned into headlines that say they've cut Medicaid. Exactly. Thank you Davos. Thank you, Davos, City of London Media, because that's what we [ __ ] have. Yeah. But but this is where this is where somewhere along the way, I need to be able to see a measurable decrease in the spending. I I need I need to see the numbers, not just the not just the headlines. But but they're reporting they're reporting though that I mean this new if it passes through the Senate, which it hasn't yet, but the spending is going up, I believe, from I mean the spending is already up from last year. Well, they haven't they're still running the old they're still running the bi the last year of the Biden remember the B the last year of the Biden budget doesn't October it's October like we we're and that money has been earmarked and has to be spent and we've got we've got Democrats running around screaming and and issuing uh getting judges to issue court injunctions to keep all the money flowing like you know we're at okay let's let's let's understand this we're already in a civil war guys, it's already here and the civil war is happening between is happening in the courts and it's happening in at the at the congressional level as well. So, let's start with the basics. Let's get this is what I was trying to say to everybody the other day. Two things, right? Because I I actually have been very angry with some of the knee-jerk libertarians on on my Twitter feed. I'm like I asked Clint Russell the Liberty Occupy the other day. He's like going on and on and on about that very point. I'm like, ""Huh, isn't it interesting?"" I'm gonna ask you a very simple question and I want to get I want a simple answer. Like, why is it that after 30 years of not trusting one goddamn government statistic that has been published by any government around the freaking world, all the libertarians are out there now running around quoting the CBO projections of what this bill is going to cost us and we don't know. Like all of a sudden, everybody now trusts government statistics because it fits their narrative, which their narrative is Trump's spending too much money because they didn't get all their cookies. They got a lot of cookies. Or that's the equivalent of holding his feet to the flames and saying, ""Make sure you do cut."" I'm sorry, say that again, Dave. I missed. It could be that what they're doing is saying they're putting pressure on him to say, ""Make sure you do cut."" I I tell you, I became desp I'm I'm at the point now where I'm at the point now where I I I know these people really well. I've traveled in these circles for 25 years. I know exactly what I'm dealing with. I'm dealing with people who have operate oppositional defiance disorder. They are critics who cannot handle actually being involved in building anything. They would rather argue about semicolons versus commas than actually [ __ ] build anything. ask you why you cannot watch my speech from the Mises Institute back in October and it's I'm telling you it's all downstream of that. I and it's dealing with academics who the worst kind of academics third rate academics I support the the M dash to the death. Um me too. What the M dash the M dash it's it's it's a the most powerful literary tool known to man. What is that? Okay. Sorry. I thought I I thought maybe that was a the like Yeah. Okay, fine. A metaphor. No, I'm talking the MD. No, I thought maybe it was like some metaphor for Thomas Massie or some [ __ ] who I just literally I'm like I'm with Trump on him. I'm like [ __ ] stopping grandstanding and actually start playing and actually start like trying to save the [ __ ] country you [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] Like he's really got my goat. Him and Paul both I'm like I'm off the [ __ ] train. It depends on what's actually happening. They might be right is my concern. I'm telling you that's the that's since the day after Trump survived Butler, Pennsylvania and they knew they were going to lose the election. These people have been trying to slice off pieces of the of the quote unquote MAGA movement like bit by bit by bit. I'm watching this every freaking day and I can just see it. I'm like, ""Oh, this here here's the latest SCOP coming out of GCHQ."" Every [ __ ] day I see the same I see something else from these people and it's I I've been watching this this is like I don't know. This is my Spidey sense at this point. This is like it's become, you know, Dexter White and I like it's become our superpower. And I'm like, can you not see it? It's like it's it's it's as obvious as the day is long. And it's really easy to get people who are anxious and worried about actually having people who are trying to fix things knowing full well that they've got an immense amount of opposition to this. You've got all this institutional inertia and then you've got nothing but a hostile freaking media and you've got, you know, we've got AI algorithms and and social media algorithms inflaming everybody's personal versions. But let's let's back it up a little bit. And and and this and this is the mess we have when at the end of the day, like I watched Trump go to I watched Trump go to the Middle East and in 10 days remake the freaking world. That was actually pretty amazing actually, I must admit. But I but for example, so when Trump first hit the airwaves and he signed executive orders sitting in the rotunda, right? Sitting right there. Um, which was impressive and I think it was actually teeing up the autopen scandal. I actually think that that that was intentional to show we should get to that too. Yeah, because that has great profound potential importance. But but but there are things that there are things that happened that were troubling. So for example, the juryy's still out and I think it might be being played brilliantly, but I gotta tell you when when it it looked for a while it's like Bobby Kennedy wasn't going to go near pharma and that he was going to take the colors out of our Froot Loops. And I'm going I'm going then then then that's that makes me despondent. when Pam Bondi who who brought out the the folders that were that were filled with publicly available information except for it was redacted you know so they redacted publicly available information and I can't I couldn't tell does she think that we don't have that information does she think that the average person doesn't realize that's all out there in the public know and then she said oh it's it's really awful and then it was nothing and I'm going, ""Is she that stupid?"" Which I could believe because I don't think she's that smart. Um, or did she just think we were that stupid? And I think just too frantically busy the first month that she was in she oversold it though. She really sold it. She really How about How about Well, but then but then how about how about she got [ __ ] Rick rolled by a bunch of by a bunch of um by a bunch of traders in the in the Southern District of New York, right? Is that not Is that not a plausible outcome? I'm not No, I don't I can't let her off that hook. I can't I can't let her off that hook because she said she said she had it on her desk and she said it's got awful stuff in it and then what she gave us had nothing. Well, she could have been sandbagged by people who gave her folders and said this is really important stuff. She said she had asking she didn't know it then. She didn't know it then. She was on the job for like four days at that point. Like, well, it's clear that Bondi is out of it's clear that Bondi is out of her out of her out of her league. I think there's a lot of That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And and so and and here's another thing. Trump was out of his league in 2016, 2017. Absolutely. Georgia Maloney was out of her league when she first took over in Italy, by the way, and she and she survived. So why don't we just watch the process and watch the machine and remember that's exact. So I tell my colleagues, I say, ""Look, ask yourself where are we going to be in a year? Stop looking where we're going to be next week. Ask where we're going to be in a year. And if you if if you're still okay and we're still okay and they've made progress, then then you got to give it time. You got to give it time."" I'm just I'm just what I'm doing is watching with I'm nervous because I see I see more headlines than reality that I can really wrap my arms around. Well, I said this last time, but you you have to you you have to consider that they are faced with the problem of having to build cases that are very profound and to do it very carefully and delicately and it is not easy to build legal cases. It takes Oh, DOJ should shut their mouths, but but they have shut their mouths for the most part. That's one of the reasons for all the frustration is because they're not leaking. No, I'm okay with that. I've been happy about that. It's when they sat up there and posted undeniably Jeffrey Epstein hung himself and I'm going, ""You didn't have to do it. You took a huge huge hit to do that."" Anyone with a half a brain was B. It might not be the end of the story, Dave. That's what I'm hoping. I'm just bringing it up. Yeah. No, I I I would agree with all of that. What I'll the other thing I'll say is that um we're in intense negotiations and sometimes like with the like with the with the tax bill like okay there's a couple things about the tax bill that I don't like. Like I didn't want them to give in on the salt tax. No offense to the New Yorkers in the audience but here in a state where we don't have state income the tyranny of state income tax. Like one of the greatest things about the original Trump tax cuts I thought was was limiting the salt deduction and that forcing forcing states that overspend and why should we be giving tax cuts tax breaks to people who live you know in that can't get their own the state legislatores under control. Well, but guess what? Some of the uh most of the other things in that bill I'm okay with. And at the end of the day, I don't want to [ __ ] the bed in order to die on a hill because this had to get done in order because the the grander plan here and I think the grander thing that is missed when we get into all these the details is you got to get this done so that Trump can ignore Congress for the next 18 months because we don't need Congress for [ __ ] anything else for the next 18 months until the midterms. interesting point. And in the meantime, you know, we I think Trump is really preoccupied with uh finance and the economy uh and and the the banking system and I think that they're all quite worried about the bond market. Oh, they should be. So, so as always we're as long as as we're going there on that and then we make sure we talk have time for the autopen stuff, too. But, uh, the bond market, you know, I I I wonder I want to get you guys thought on this, you know, cuz Japan, from what I'm reading, I mean, that's I mean, Tom, is that the red flashing light right now? We need to be watching. No, I I'm watching all this [ __ ] and and all I see is the same thing I saw a month ago. Synthetic Libore ends on on the 31st of March. Trump announces the Liberation Day tariffs on the 2nd. By Friday that week, they start the they start the attack on the sofa strip versus the 10 versus the 10-year. I I watched an insane amount of unbelievable [ __ ] attack on our on our money markets on sofur, which we no crisis, little bit of, okay, we had a dip in the in the Dow, you know, we had some volatility. They attacked the bond market. Everybody and their brother wrote every [ __ ] headline. imaginable. The bots were out in full. Bloomberg was out there jumping out of [ __ ] windows. I'm on the floor of the uh the the New York Stock Exchange with Newsmax that week watching Jim Kramer literally four feet away from Jim Kramer like trying to slam the world. I'm like I'm watching this going, ""Okay, am I watching like you want to talk about [ __ ] You want to talk about fake and gay?"" I said it then and I'll say it now. That was Europe. That was Davos. That was City of London. attacking our bond markets. They failed a month later. Oh, we can't attack the US bond market directly. Let's go through Japan. And they timed that hit with a with with with budgetary battles going on in the diet in J in Japan at the same time. So, who's blowing now? All of a sudden, we come out with a booties downgrade on Friday and then Monday morning we're back to everybody stayed at a holiday and express on Sunday night and is now an expert in the [ __ ] Japanese carry trade. Well, the so the so the carry trade some number of months ago they said the carry trade was broken and then all a sudden serious players were saying and it's over now and I go you got a like a 30-year carry trade that ended in three days. Is that really what your story is? It was. So the question is though, someone has got to be getting blown up right now because of that Japanese bond market. Who's getting blown up? I'm going to I'm going to go on a on a limb here and I'm going to tell you that well if it's a limb for me. Uh who's been complaining about who's been complaining about who's been complaining about dollar liquidity? Who's been who writes a paper saying that that gold um represents an existential threat to the European banking system? I don't remember. Oh, you see Dave, this is part of been the problem part of the problem with Twitter recently. Twitter hasn't been working well for about the last week because Vince Launchie and me and Brent Johnson, we've been all over the [ __ ] like a [ __ ] rat. Well, so the bond market, so there's a couple things that are going to go out. So what happened this morning? The ECB came out this morning and said, ""We're not going to implement Basel 3 for another year."" Why? Because the United States said, ""Oh, by the way, we're not implementing Basel 3 because we're not going to disadvantage our banks relative to European banks."" As Jamie Diamond's been screaming about for two years. I was told six months ago by people in by by people in the banking industry like ain't no way we're ever going to implement Basel 3. So that affects all the reserve ratios and everything. Yeah. Well, so so on top of the SLR and I did a podcast with Caitlyn Long um a couple weeks ago, episode 213 of the Gold Goats and Guns podcast. I'm not here pimping myself, folks. Caitlyn Long crushed it and pushed it like hit crushed it like Henry Aaron. Like she was off the freaking charts good. And she went through and she tied together the stable coin bill. She ti the RSAR, the the supplemental leverage ratio and all of that stuff in our bond markets. It's just like they're setting up uh all new markets for the US Treasury market and we're going to get rid of the SLR. That's talked about it today. We're probably going to get rid of it. Yeah. Because it's upwards of $500 billion worth of new reserves for the banks. Kaitlin like like it never made any sense that the that we have to hold excess reserves against the risk-free asset on bank balance sheets. Makes no sense. Our star is the freaking 10-year. Why do we have to hold excess leverage against the risk-free rate? I mean, I'm not This is not my a I'm not like putting on my Austrian hat here. My Austrian hat says there is no such thing as a risk-free rate, right? But I'm talking about in like, you know, in terms of what was the justification for it? The justification for it is, as always, guys, is to bring down is to disadvantage our banking system relative to everybody else's. It's no different than tax harmonization through the OECD or any of this other [ __ ] It's all about making propping up Scoratica Europe and ensuring that our money tax money and our deficit all goes over there to keep them to to to to supplement them. That's over. Trump is literally setting up with tariffs and all the I can see it all in front of me like the tariffs, the um the changes to the banking system. They are going to enforce a domestic par on the dollar domestically that is lower than the offshore dollar markets. We have the power. We have sulfur. We don't have libore anymore. For most of our lives, we lived under a system where the euro dollar system enforced par on the Federal Reserve, not the Federal Reserve enforcing par on the Euro dollar system. That has flipped. That's where we are. That's what that is what everybody is really screaming about. Where does that leave the Europeans? Seeing is downstream of that. Where does that leave the Europeans? It leaves them on the It leaves them desperately trying to cobble together a digital euro. It leaves them needing to [ __ ] fight a tie us into a war in Ukraine. It leaves us It leaves them Trump is going around the world literally cutting everybody off, cutting the Europeans off on all their forms of of physical capital. you they just installed Mark Carney in Canada to try and set them up as as an offshore shadow bank and and dollar liquidity pool to attack us with. And I got news for you. Trump's gonna is going to kneecap them because British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan all want to leave now. I just got back from Calgary like two like five days ago. They're all like frothing at the mouth ready to like secede from Canada. I'm like not yet. You guys have a lot of work to do. Yeah, but I'm not dead serious. I'm not talking about like scripts here. I'm talking about people who are are prominent members of Alberta's economy. Yeah. And they're like they're done like and all across Canada like it's sinc what's what's this is this is the story that nobody can that the the the the the individual headlines can't tell you. You have to take the step back and ask yourself what is Trump doing on Thursday and Friday to set the talking points for the next week. He does this every week. Now, if you haven't noticed, on somewhere around Wednesday, this we have like peak volatility during the week where everybody's like fighting amongst themselves. Trump comes out and he moves in on Thursday and he says something different. He goes like 90 degrees in a different direction, says some goddamn thing, pisses everybody off. We get into Friday, they respond some other way. And then they spend all weekend coordinating their talking points as to what they're going to do on on how they're going to open the markets on Monday morning. They write their little things to Emily's list and everybody gets their their talking points and you see it on Bloomberg and Financial Times and all the rest of it. And then we have a Monday and Tuesday they run their thing and this week it was the Japanese yen carry trade. When the Japanese finally have a 40-year bond rate yield that's somewhere close to their inflation rate. That's all it is. And everybody's like, ""Oh my god."" Like they're widening their hair. No, but it's it becomes like [ __ ] It becomes an oh my god when you consider the number of possible people who were counting on that not being true. So it's not back to the private equity guys and all the other guys who I was talking about earlier and what Bill Aman's talking about with all the endowments. I think those are the ones who are are in the biggest amount of trouble. But I just don't think at this point anybody in in Capitol Hill gives a [ __ ] I'm dead serious. I'm like Trump just said it the other day. We have a we have a [ __ ] country to save and I'm not worried about this [ __ ] Pass the goddamn bill today. It's the entire pension system, not just the endowments. Sure. But we've been at four and a half% on the Fed funds rate or higher for over two years now. Right. We're not at 1% Dave. No, I know. I know. And and and people there are commodity stocks out there. There are commodity stocks out there that are sitting in the [ __ ] dirt trading at six times earnings throwing off 6%. Well, they're not hard to find. Well, I Yeah, I guess not that hard to find. They're trading at nine times earnings or seven times earnings. I was looking at my Dude, I was looking at my portfolio this morning going, ""How in the [ __ ] are these things trading at this at the at this this level?"" Well, they can be dividend traps, too. You can sit there be looking at a commodity stock. Great examples, the platinum miners where they were trading at, you know, PE of six and dividend yields of six. Next thing you know, their pees are are infinity because they don't have earnings and they have no dividends left. You go, what the [ __ ] just happened, right? That's not what's happening. I'm literally looking at REITs that are like raising their dividends and their stock price is falling and they're trading and and they're trading at four and a half% for a REIT. Anything over three and a half on a REIT is like, holy [ __ ] It's like, you know, could you could you could be mana from heaven? No. No, because a re could be like the the epitome of junk bondage. I mean, it just it just we've got a real estate problem coming at us in a big way. And so the REITs could all get I'm trying not to give away the the actual stock I'm talking about here because it's a kind of a unique stock, but it's actually also a REIT. Um because I, you know, I do have to protect my business in some way, man, shape, or form. But I'm like looking at this going, how in the stock, how in the [ __ ] is this stock trading at 4.7%. It makes no sense. But other than the fact that because the rest of the REIT market isn't [ __ ] we're the baby the babies get to run out with the bath bar. There are plenty of gems out there. There are plenty of gems out there. Um and the market is taking its time trying to find them. And what I'm beginning to watch now just the market's also the market's also completely and utterly failing to price discover. Of course, we're in a we're in a world of fake money. I know it's not established that the world is fake and No, no, but when it discovers how to price discover when it when it disco when it redefineses price discovery, all these seemingly great investments are all going to get real ugly real fast. Agreed. Um, have anybody looked at the DAX recently? Yeah, it's gone hyperbolic. Hyperbolic. It's just completely nuts. Yes, it's a failing economy with an with an exponential growth in the Well, so that's my So the so the German bun market is also fake and gay because money is moving into German stocks because nobody wants to buy buns. The only person buying buns is Christine Lagarde. But it showed it control in the United States how fake the market is. Like for example, you know the energy that people talk about energy. Well, the price of oil is pretty low and if it stays low, these energy companies are going to quit paying dividends. Agreed. A lot of them aren't paying dividends. Some of them aren't paying dividends. But I'm I'm watching like I Dude, I just went over Shell's earnings the other day. Shell's doing just fine. trading in, you know, within 10 15 within 15% of his all-time high, facing between just trading in a range between 60 and 75 a share, then throwing off 6%. Trading at a PED and nine. I asked Rock this morning, it's like, what's where we where are we in LG global LG prices up? And Shell's more of a of an LG company than they are an oil major. Well, so I had a long chat with Chris Martinson last night who called and I just shoot the [ __ ] and uh and and and and he seemed to support what I've been picking up and that is that the that the LG market's rolling over that the supply demand curve is getting all [ __ ] up. Maybe now that could influence the price, but I'm not sure what it does to companies who need to sell LNG. Well, I you know the the the fun part about this is that there's a world one of the thing I I think we should actually back up and we should really ask ourselves what's going on with the tariffs. I was talking to a friend of mine this morning. He's like, ""Dude, I'm working at Walmart right now and the prices haven't moved."" I'm like, ""Explain that to me."" I'm like, ""Well, isn't the consumer sovereign? Producers aren't."" The tariffs just seem to be levers to me then and they're just moving up and down constantly now. and they're totally in flux and I I don't think anybody nothing has settled with that. I think that's part I think that's part of the reason why we're seeing the volatility that we're seeing in markets. I think it's going to be that way for a little while and I think that there's a lot of people out there whose baywicks are being are are being um impinged upon. I I you know like look we're at a moment in time when like the global forex market is going to change. Mhm. It is. But I do I do think that they will eventually be settled and settled in the direction of I I hate to use this word, but I'll use it anyway. They'll be settled in in the direction of more equity between the trading partners. Yeah. Yeah. I I I agreed. I agreed. I think so because Trump is going to force it to happen. Well, think of it this way. What Trump has basically said, you know, I I I mean, I've been thinking I've been talking about this like for, you know, months now. We've all been talking about this for months. And I finally like hit on that. I'm like I reminded myself of basically first principles. Who's sovereign in a market? The guy with the money or the guy with the good. The guy with the money. You've got as the producer, you have to convince me to open up my [ __ ] wallet like Jack Benny and, you know, not pull flies out, right? Like that's, you know, that's how old I am. Like we I know the crowd. I could So who's got the money? Who's got the money? Nobody. That's the point. So that's my point. That's I understand that, Dave. But in how you deal with um rebalancing global trade, what we've been doing for years is we've been saying to the US consumer, not only are you going to subsidize offshore production, you're then going to pay a premium to buy that stuff back. So, it's a it we're get we were getting [ __ ] going coming and going and all and all Trump is doing is saying, ""Hey, why don't we um why don't we like why don't we tell the American consumer you're sovereign and you guys pay and you guys produce [ __ ] and we'll uh and you know, pay it to our markets."" Like, did you see what he did to the European Union this morning? That's why the DAX is going to roll over now because he just came out this morning. He said, ""Look, I've been trying to negotiate with these people, but these people are insane because they hate us."" By the way, Europe hates us. They always have. Can I can I throw in something here, too? And this is other, you know, conversations I've had with my friend Matt Smith several times, and I think I might even brought it up last time with you guys. Um, so I forgive me if bringing up again, but are we moving towards a model similar to China where the United States is looking at China's model and saying this is what works and that's what the re-industrialization right now of the of What part of it are you talking about that works? What part of that works? What part of China's model? Because some of it doesn't work at all. Well, I think the I think what they're saying I think in that convers those conversations I had with him in reference to having some uh some western uh western am I getting my word de democ western um companies that have invested in China where now the manufacturing is there we need to start manufacturing bring that stuff back to what Tom had said but also um you know build our manufacturing base up so it's you know runs similar to what China's model is because China's Are they consist of an offshore onshore yuan? Yeah. Are they still part of it? I agree with that. That's what we're moving towards. Are they still a communist country? Do you do you still consider China a communist country? They have a dictator, but no, not not the governance. I think politically they are. I just don't think economically they are. But I don't see Trump aiming at that as the aiming at anything like that. I think he is trying to disconnect uh as much as possible from all of these connections and make uh the USA as independent as possible of all of it long enough for us to rebuild some kind of a production capacity so that we can get through the what is going to be the real crisis ahead of of uh the collapse of of of Western Civ. So the end of glo the end of globalism and the Monroe doctrine kind of rolled together into one joint. Yeah. Yeah. We we we really do have to get get away from this. Like I globalism is a is a cancer. Um and the what we call free trade is not free trade. Like well someone said there's no such thing as free trade. There's no such thing as fair trade. There's such a thing as balanced trade. Yeah. I think that's about right from an international perspective. I agree with that. And then, you know, you you roll that into the the conundrums that we're suffering from with currencies and and and the lack of uh the essential function of markets that Dave just mentioned, price discovery, and you don't know the price of anything, including the price of currencies or or the value of currencies and and and the value of uh you know, or whether the money is even there. I mean I I that my position for the last 20 years has been that much of what we consider to be our reserve capital is not really there. It's a figment of it's a figment of uh a system that's gone off the rails. Agreed. And that's why you're watching gold refusing to back down. Yeah. Gold went up like 60 points today or 58 points. I didn't even look I I've been so busy. I didn't even look had a chance and I just looked at it a few minutes ago. I' I've been too busy myself. But that's a surprise after the you know the uh back off that it just came came down from. So it's been it's it the the fact that gold and and then silver. Oh wow. Silver closed to 3360 today. That's nice. Now the big one the thing that I'm looking forward the I'm looking at I'm just watching copper at this point. Watching copper and silver as my leading indicators for um another round of commodity cost push inflation. That and gasoline of course. So what do you see in copper? Copper closed today at 486. It's up 16. It's up 18 cents today into into the weekly close. Well, but copper also has that schizophrenia where it also can respond to the downside when the economy goes to [ __ ] So, so, so if we have a stagflation, copper could go up in price while while the demand for copper is down, right? That sort of thing. Um, so Dr. copper maybe have a price discovery problem too is my concern maybe. But and I I worry that that the gold the gold silver ratio crowd which I understand the argument. I worry that they that that the current story is not about it's not a bi metallic story. It's sovereign states buying gold and saying we don't give one [ __ ] about silver. No, they don't. And so so that maybe that maintain that silver's industrial metal for a long time. Well, but maybe that arbitrage will eventually pay. I I worry it'll pay by by gold going down. Um yeah, but there's that. But but but um you know, by the way, if you're unexposed to precious metals and you want to somehow get exposure, the gold silver paradox um is is offering an opportunity to uh to to get into precious metals without buying into a what appears to be a frothy market. So silver is not frothy. No, not at all. No, you want the least exact opposite of that. The least frothy market turns out to be platinum, which I've been chatting with a lot of people about. Platinum's been dead. Money flattered a pancake. It looks like a looks like some line in the ER where the patients now got rigabortis. Is that because 10 years? Is that because for the last 10 years there's been this expectation that there would be producing far fewer catalytic catalytic converters. Um they all moved over to palladium ages ago. Palladium is the catalytic converter. Oh, they can go back and forth. But the other thing is is that um is that apparently apparently hybrids use more than than ICE. So the guys who think and I I think we're going to stop at hybrids. I don't think we're going to go all the way to EVs. I think we're going to stop at hybrids because I don't think you want to depend on that charge. I think you want to have that gas tank there, too. And I sure as hell wouldn't go hybrids are really good. I think hybrids are really good technology. And I think that the mixture of high torque especially I mean I've been arguing for years that like hybrid hybrid designs for trucks makes the most sense where you on demand torque to move a large mass right is a is a really powerful thing. I I don't see hybrids for small cars being all that useful. I think for trucks on the other hand where you need Ram's been been doing that their you know e torque version of that where they it gives you know it's an it doesn't have a a classic automatic transmission. has a it has an electric motor that effectively assists the gear changes and um I it's been I think it's fraught with problems and everything else but basic the basic idea is when you need torque and you need you're trying to move a 6,000lb truck plus possibly a load that extra ondemand torque that is generated from an electric motor is is something that you you can't beat with you can't create that with an internal combustion engine. But once you're at the dynamic coefficient of friction as opposed to the static coefficient of friction, now you're now the IC is a far more useful thing. So I've always argued for that and you know me, I'm a petrol head. So I mean like died in the wool give me my internal combustion engine, but I will you know but from that perspective I think that it's very useful. Um, the thing about platinum and I I every time I every time, you know, somebody says, ""Could you look at platinum for me, please?"" And I've been asked I've been asked the same question and every year I look at the USGS supply and demand numbers for platinum. And because platinum is so freaking rare, every gram of platinum that is used is recycled and put back into the market. And I don't see a there. What I see is it's year every year. It's like one of the few markets where supply and demand are in kind of per almost perfect harmony and the only effect you get in the price of rising fall in the price of platinum is you know is monetary inflation. I just don't think my suspicion maybe I'm wrong but maybe that'll change. you look if you look at a platinum chart the last 10 years has been so flat that it looks pegged to me and that gets me to a geopolitical question of why that could be something like hurt hurt the Russians you know that sort of thing I hey I I I I'm I'm you know me I I love arguments like that platinum is the one is the one metal that I just I'm like yeah like I've looked at it it's like in the remaining time we have can we get move on to auto pen thing. Sure. Because we're getting into really esoteric metal arguments here. Fair enough. And if we have some time after, can we do can we talk about Bitcoin if we have time? Go ahead, Jim. Let's do the autopen. Well, so you know the what what should have been a big question for for quite a while now for many months the question of whether Joe Biden was even capable enough to do to act in any way as president and it was pretty obvious that he couldn't and finally this question is being called and uh I think that representative comr is threat threatening to bring all these former White House people into his committee and have them start talking about what that was about. I do think that there's going to be a determination to find out exactly who was acting as president and we probably have a fair idea now, you know, just by process of elimination. and the name. Well, there there's um Biden's insiders, Steve Reti and Mike Donlin and uh uh an I forgot her last name and something. I heard Anita Dunn. Excuse me. they need it done. And um but you know there are a number of others uh I think uh uh Susan Rice who is really just hiding in a burrow through the whole three I guess three plus years that she was in the Biden uh administration and no one heard a peep out of her and she was supposedly the domestic uh affairs advisor and she just hid and yet you know you have the feeling that she was must have been in charge of something important if not just transmitting messages from Calorama where Obama was hiding out a neighborhood uh north of uh the White House to the people running Obama. So there was a whole operation going on that's not even the Biden pen could even be the Biden pen was like a photocopier in a room and you went to the Biden pen room. It wasn't much more than an elaborate uh version of that. But then the question is what about all the the what about the bills that he signed and the the executive orders that he signed not just the pardons and things and uh are they going to is there legitimacy going to be questioned and if so what happens then and what's the process and uh is there going to be any kind of uh criminal accountability for all this because it does seem like a nefarious conspiracy to hide a very important piece of truth from the American people about how their government is being run. This isn't just Edith Bowling covering for uh Woodro Wilson in in a much more primitive type of political setup. This is a very elaborate thing, especially with the uh the own goal of them having to deal with that plus the her tapes, right? the release of the partial interview from Michael her on Friday of last week or Thursday Friday perfectly timed perfectly timed so the question is downgrade that happens at the same time and then on Monday they have to come out with oh poor Joe's got cancer that's an own goal because dude no one like it's a very low order order probability Dexter White and I did a podcast yesterday which I haven't had a chance to to publish yet which I'll get out tomorrow morning where we go over this for like most to the podcast. We just go through a lot of the the the mechanics of you know prostate cancer this that and all of these things and we're like they knew in the the high probability of men is that they knew in 2020 that he had it was obviously a tool. I mean all all of the 2020 they knew before 2020. check. I mean, on the vascular dementia side of things, I agree. On the on the pro on the prostate cancer thing, that they had absolutely no business running him in 2024. They were trying to do so in order to have him die in office and then put over whoever they want and deny the American people their [ __ ] democracy again. Mhm. Treasonous behavior. And and as a parallel as a parallel to that uh big question about who was running Joe Biden is what are we going to do about these lawfare ninjas, the Norm Eisens and Mark Elias's and and Mary McCords and and and that whole gang that has basically set in motion a giant engine of uh obstruction to prevent the executive branch from operating. uh is there, you know, none of us are lawyers, but there's got to be some kind of federal statute that says you can't run a conspiracy like that. It's a sedicious conspiracy. It's an it's obstruction of justice and and sedition. So, uh you know, how long does that continue? And how is a guy who is so obviously wicked as Norm Eisen just allowed to continue giggling on on uh uh uh Twitter or X, which he's doing. He's standing there laughing at us constantly. Are any of you following the ex account called the researcher? Do you know him? No. No. He he he he he uh uh seems to concentrate on Norm Eisen's misadventures as the chief lawfare ninja ninja and it's he's very he's worth following and uh uh you know these people are making it impossible to govern. Yes. So what do you suppose what do you suppose can be done about them or or what do you see developing out of this? Evidently, not much. No, I was I was going to leave it to Dave. So, I think it, as you said, I think for the DOJ to build a case just against one person takes enormous resources. Yes. Um, I I'm listening I finished actually an audio book on Sons of Sam, and you wouldn't believe the resources that went into studying uh David Burkowitz's network. Not just David Burkowitz. It turns out David Burkowitz was part of a very large network. What was that? I've never heard of this network ever. I thought he was just a lone wolf. Yeah, that's the story that they wanted to tell you. It turns out it's heritage was tied to this vast network of of Satanists which on the surface you go Satanist. It turns out I I really think the Satanists are the bottom rung of the ladder. Above that there's all sorts of power plays, drugs, all sorts of p of political things and stuff like that. So the the Satanist produced kind of a standing army of wackadoodles to do [ __ ] But Perkowitz, for example, the son of Fam's killings, which I was in New York for some of them, um he did a couple and a whole a large number of them were done by other people and they ultimately tra trace it to this guy named Mory Terry. Um traces it to to uh satanic cult networks that trace to Manson and all sorts of different networks that that that that persist to this day actually. and and the connections are spectacular. There's there's obviously they're threads connecting them. So it turns out the problem with it there were there was supposedly 22 people who were who were complic who were who were tied together. So when Burkwoods first got arrested when he got arrested, they got arrested. He said, ""I've been waiting for you."" Right? They literally, you know, poke a gun in the car and he says, ""I've been waiting for you."" And his apartment's all [ __ ] up and he looks like a wackadoodle. And when they interview him, he he acts like he's completely psychotic. And then amazingly, about a year or two later, he's talking to this journalist um and he's losing his psychosis very quickly and and all of a sudden he's not insane at all. And he starts throwing out these cryptic hints. He starts talking about crimes that he shouldn't know about that were committed by this group. And he says there's thousands of them. and and so so so just tracking something like that for example can take huge resources and and you're in some sense I don't know if these guys are Satanists or not um but but they are a a conspiracy a vast network um one of the problems that they had with this with the network that and these are these are networks they have like hubs in in in North Dakota and Los Angeles and it's it's really it's really a very complicated and and and one of things they do is when someone becomes risky, like they're they're hot on someone's trail, they just whack them. So, so the the the the 22 that that that Burkowitz said were invol the sort of in the this immediate cult, um at least half of them got whacked before they could get anything out of him. And and why didn't Burkowitz get whacked? Because whacking someone in prison is the easiest thing to do. Well, it turns out he wasn't ratting out anyone who was alive. Mhm. And and he says, ""I can't rat out anyone who's alive."" But he was he was terrified actually. He he one of the reason he was mad when they talked to some cop and he'd spill his guts and he'd say, ""I'm not talking to you anymore. You just [ __ ] up."" Um and so at the end like 10 years later, there's an inside edition on him where they interviewed him. He's still alive, isn't he? Yeah, I think so. And um and and it there's these weird connections. So it's sort of like um and this is true with politics too, right? So and and I the reason I'm reading about it because I think the two are the same network. I I really do think that the political system is filled with people who are so profoundly compromised. And so what you're trying to do is get justice out of a system that is like trying to say, well, why don't we just go, you know, arrest Sam Gotti? And you go because it doesn't work that well, you know? I mean, you really takes a huge amount of work and to to pull one of these one of these organizations apart. I think I I think they're all I think the CIA and the FBI, I think they're all organized crime and and and some of them pretend to be legit. Someone said the difference between the FBI and the KGB is the KGB never profess to be legit. Well, you do have to wonder what John Ratcliffe is doing. He's been awful quiet. Well, Comey's in trouble, right? Look at this [ __ ] Comey has neo Marxist roots. Goes back to the Frankfurt school. Bad roots. And then all a sudden his daughter's involved in Epstein trials and Gain Maxwell trials and stuff like that. You go, Comey's daughter. How'd that happen? And then then Comey does the 8647 thing in the sand. You saw that this week. And then pretends like pretends like he didn't know what it meant. I'm going, you're the head of the FBI. Do you know what 86 means? You don't know what 47 means? I don't think so. I mean, I saw I saw I saw a video of Gretchen Whitmer from 2020 or something like that during co. She had a little 8645 thing in the corner of of She did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was like right there. She's like on CNN or whatever, but in the corner down there, she had a little little thing. It's an 8645. It was like It was like a can. It was like a a kids c a candle you would see on is that kind of thing. It was a little piece of plastic but it could easily have like a been you know made out of wax right that kind of I think that Comey is going to go through the process. I think that they are going to at least put him through some kind of process that's going to cost him his book royalties at least. Well it's you know interestingly enough he's not it's possible he had to throw himself under the bus. Maybe that whole thing was this. Maybe that was like when Prince Andrew did his interview that looked awful. Maybe Comey was told, ""Now it's your time. You're going to go up and make an [ __ ] yourself and then we're going to raise holy hell and you're not going to go to prison."" But but you're going to fall on your sword. Well, we'll see what happens. He's always been a very He's been always been a very um loyal Clintonista. Always always a very loyal Clintonista. person, you know, and what what I wrote in in my blog this morning, Friday morning, was that uh the original sin that Jake Tapper uh turned into the title of his book, speaking of douchebags, the original sin really is uh Hillary Clinton. You know, it all starts with with her being uh uh running behind in the 2016 election and jinning up the Russia collusion thing. And absolutely everything that the Democratic Party has done since the summer of 2016 has been in one way or another an ass covering operation that included some other sort of political crime and that and it all runs and it all runs through MI6 and every bit of it runs through MI6. So So Clinton goes I I think I told you guys about the JFK reading the poem of Monica Lewinsky when she was 9 years old. I told you that story. What? Okay. So, JFK Jr. is being interviewed on Jay Leno. He he's on Jay Leno 1998 right before he mysteriously got whack because he's going to run for the Senate that Hillary got. Um but but Leno and he are heading towards him reading. It's clearly planned. It wasn't just they weren't just winging it. And JFK Jr. pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket. You can get it on YouTube. Just go search JFK Jr. Leno and you'll find it. Um, and he pulls out this letter and he says this piece of paper and he says he's and he as he's pulling out he says, ""Oh, I'm so going to burn in hell for saying for doing this."" And then he reads this this this poem written by a nine-year-old girl. And and the first line told me um she's been she's been she's been trafficked. He's the poem starts out says, ""I am a very yummy nine-year-old girl."" I go, ""Red flag."" Right? And she says, ""I am yummy in a very weird kind of way. Red flag."" And then she says, ""Think of me as a big piece of dough with all the toppings."" I go, ""Big [ __ ] red flag."" So, so, so JFK and Leno don't seem to understand that this is classic pedophile language. Is it pizza talk, by the way? Yeah, that's the pizza talk. That's That's right. That's exactly right. And then it turns out it was 9-year-old Monica Lewinsky. Now, why is that important? It's important because it just rewrote the whole Monica Lewinsky scandal. This chick has been a trafficked MK Ultra chick from the start. And and and then and then I replay the tape and you know the picture of Bill Clinton meeting JFK senior. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Has it ever struck you as the probability of that photo? Well, yeah, a little bit. But but you know the chronology is there and and you know Clinton's ambitions even at an early age got him to where he he came from a fatherless a fatherless home. He was a hick and all of a sudden there he is. Yeah. But he was look he obviously became a very skilled charismatic charming politician. Well is it possible he was already on the track? Of course. I don't know. I have a hard a hard time thinking that every person in America is being trafficked. If No, no. But if you read about the trafficking, one of the things they do is first first they break you, but then they train you. So I was on a Zoom call with Kathy O'Brien, which if you've paid attention to this [ __ ] she's famous famous, and a woman named Juliet Angle, and I was quizzing Angel about her memories and things like that, but um they break you down, and she ended up getting an MD degree. They they build you back up. They they Jason Bourne they you know they they build you back up and I've talked to Brian extensively about this. He says it's a science at this point breaking you down. They break you down in awful awful ways. And then they What do we know about Monica Lewinsky? She was just a uh you know a kid in some uh kind of middle class Jewish household in Los Angeles. It doesn't seem that doesn't add up. That's where the kids come from. That's the most astonishing thing. They're they're coming. These are that if you read about this [ __ ] what you find is that the kids are coming from what seem like normal middle class families and on the weekends they're being sent out. The families are trafficking them. Yeah. You you when you read this [ __ ] you can't you just can't believe it. But I've again long What's in it for the families? Yeah. Do they realize it? Do they know where they're being sent to? Yes, they do. The the families are themselves in it. It's a multi-generational cluster [ __ ] And so the families traffic their kids in. It's You've researched a lot of this and I have researched none of it. So I don't find Yeah. I'm not this is not my skeptical phase. This is my absorbing phase. Well, so so so what you what you find is that it's it's so incredible that that that you can't process it, but but the people who have processed it um like Church of Scientology is a is a total recruiting tool for wackadoodles to do bad [ __ ] The Church of Scientology is an unbelievably bizarre organization and and and and so what you do is so so if you listen to these survivors they first they get shredded. I mean I'm talking tortured abused the satanic [ __ ] I think is part of breaking their will. they get dissociative identity disorder, did and and they have all these different personalities. They get fragmented and then they sort of piece them back together and they go, ""You're going to be an assassin."" And like um Anakah Lucas, who's one of the more famous ones, said, ""You know, we were all taught to kill. We're all taught to kill."" And and and then there's other ones they go, ""Oh, this one's fant this one's a social."" So some are trained to be espionage. Juliet Engel said that she was she was her job was to target important people. She was kind of an Epstein type, but but but she she wouldn't know who the person was and why, but she she'd be pointed and say, ""That's the guy I got to get the dirt on."" Do you have any reason to believe that the Biden family was involved in any of that or? Um, I think Well, first of all, you've got the problem with Joe's daughter and the [ __ ] she wrote in her diary being weird as [ __ ] Um, then you got you got those those pictures of of Joe with Jill where Jill doesn't look at day over 16. She was their babysitter. Mhm. And having she wasn't she married at the time that that they carried on. Well, one could argue that maybe they carried on when she was 16. Okay. And it was years before when before his wife was she was their babysitter. Uhhuh. Right. And that seems she seems like an utter like an utter [ __ ] now. Well, she certainly she seems sociopathic, right? Yeah. And she seems like she hates Joe. Well, not just that, but she left him. Yeah. She left him in harm's way because of her desire or her taking commands from someone. So, so I've gone down this rabbit hole and it's it's a very difficult rabbit hole because you almost never get anything 100% definitive. It it really requires extrapolations over information gaps and things like that. But I I think it's undeniable. It's just that you never know when you're being duped and when you you've got a real case. But there are there are definitely these these these um these networks that have been uncovered. A great a one of the most interesting ones to me is the finders because three independent police organizations got onto the same network independently of each other and then the FBI came in and wrapped it up and it was over. What are these are these all internationally connected to each other? Because I'm assuming they're all well there's there's degrees, right? And so it's and and some are internationally. Um, I think Europe has a bigger problem than the US because of its bloodlines and its ancient histories and its royalties and [ __ ] like that. I think the entire royal family is [ __ ] beyond comprehension. I I think the entire royal family is just just bizarre. I think Prince Andrew is just a tip of the iceberg and um Belgium has a particularly cute problem. But but for example, there's this uh it's called harvest season when there's a crisis. So, the Clinton Foundation um was harvesting kids from Haiti repeatedly. I think that's the their Haitian connection and and and several Clinton Foundation members got thrown in Haitian prisons for it and they had to go bail them out. She had a woman named Laura Silsby and um Oh, this is above the fold news. They had to go get her out of a Haitian Haitian prison must not be fun. Yeah, I wouldn't think so. But um but any Haitian society wouldn't be fun, right? Compared to Haitian prison. Well, where's there a crisis? So supposedly Eastern Europe has been a terrible source because first of all it's it's kind of third world. Second of all um the kids are appealing. Blondhaired blue-eyed kids bring a lot of money. A guy named Ted Gunderson who was a shortlister for to run the FBI said that in back in 1992 he said a blondhaired blue-eyed kid will bring 50 grand on the open market. And um and and so where would you get kids now? Well let's start with Ukraine. Ukraine was already a trafficking hub and then the Ukraine war starts. Where do you think all the orphans went, right? And this this is the problem now. Now no different than the than Poland or Hungary or any of these other places in the 90s. The official numbers the official numbers whether it's FBI, CIA, you know, various organizations on traffic are like in the million people a year, million kids a year. Those are official numbers. They all accept those kind of numbers. And then you say, ""Name one person who's been arrested for receiving one of those kids."" Zero. If I can name one, I I can name some now, but the one that people might get was Denny Hastard. Okay. Right. Former Speaker of the House. That's right. Um, again, there was this famous interview of guy named Janice. So, I'm on this Zoom call with these two generals and one of them happens to mention Janda. I go, ""Wait a minute, orthopedic surgeon, right?"" And he goes, ""Yeah."" And I go, ""Is he a good guy or a bad guy?"" And he goes, ""Oh, he's a real good guy."" And um and and because Jana was being interviewed and and and he he was under secretary of something to do with health and I think was under Bush Jr. Um, and he's sitting there the first week on the job with a guy in in inside the beltway. And the guy says, ""Whatever you do, never go to a private party. Never."" And Janice says, ""Why?"" And the guy says, guy says, ""Because you'll wake up in the morning in a total fog. You won't know what happened and you'll have a Polaroid clipped to your shirt with you and a 5-year-old."" And then that hit me like a truck because I realized they don't have to corrupt you. They just have to slip a Mickey into your drink. That's all they need to do. Do they teach? Do you think that somebody would have kind of figured that out, gone to a private party, managed to not drink anything, right? And and figured out what's going on. And then they end up or Mike up or can't be killed. there there are cement collages and like the whole thing just it's it's like this Burkowitz um you can even read about this Burkowitz network in Wikipedia it's watered down as [ __ ] but it's even in Wikipedia at this point um and and again the people within the cult as as as information about the cult migrated the people got whacked they just whacked it's like it's like the nine cops who saw um Anthony Weiner 's laptop. You know that story, right? Nine cops saw Anthony Weiner's laptop. Those nine cops are now dead. Don't you think that Patel and Bonino had a little kind of deer in the headlight look when they were asked about Epstein? Absolutely. Absolutely. They were they they they had they knew they were lying. They knew they were lying. Yeah. They they had to I'm not sure that that's going to be the end of it. Neither. Well, I I I agree with that, but I still don't understand. Here's what I would do in that situ. I'd say I someone said, ""Look, I would say, look, obviously something's very screwy there. It's going to take years to figure it out."" And then move on, right? You don't have to say something patently stupid. Sure. Yeah. Well, they they're in positions where they can make things happen and I I wouldn't be surprised if they make some stuff happen about that and that they're just, you know, playing for time. And I think that's I think that's part of this and and going back to all the things that I remember when I when I go like on one of my antiqu Europe rants or whatever, what I'm really going on going on is an antithese people rant. What I'm really it's like anti these people rant what Dave is just talking about and that and that the way you ultimately you have to take you have to get you have to take apart these people's money systems where they're constantly getting our money or you know they're getting they're getting the ability to launder free money to them to do X And so all of the things that we've talked about today are aspects of that dismantling. And one of the things that I think we should all remind ourselves of is that um what Trump and Elon Musk said at the beginning of the administration, look, we're going to make mistakes. We're going to deport the wrong people. We're going to do we're going to we're going to do this. We're going to do we're we have to go at this with a shotgun and then ask for forgiveness later. And we're in a news cycle and that is designed to highlight every mistake and radicalize people for every mistake. So, they're going to highlight every mistake and ignore all the other other other stuff because it's attacking, I think, all the stuff that Dave just talked about. It's surprised to the upside. The guy who's surprised to the upside is is um Rubio. Yes. Foam party Marco. Who would have thought? He's very poised, very self-possessed and and a great fighter. And interestingly enough, what I it it goes back to what I you know, Marco Rubio's primmaaccia evidence in my mind of somebody with what I call the what we call the manila envelope quotient. Someone is in control of the manila envelopes of Marco Rubio that wasn't in control of them previously. Previously, these people were in control of the middle manila envelopes. Now Trump's in charge of them for lack of or what Trump is. You know, you put air quotes around Trump, what Trump represents. And that has freed Marco to now to now we actually get to start seeing in some way what the real Marco looks like. Yeah. Who is and he's a chameleon, but I think he's gotten enough shark bites and he's got enough I think he knows how to spar. Yeah. And one thing I was thinking when I was watching him in action this week, uh, testif testifying in front of a Senate committee is that, let let's face it, he was, wasn't he formerly the chairman of the Senate Intel Committee for a while? And, uh, you know, he knows the the Senate Intel Committee. He knows how sinister uh, it is. He knows what it was doing, what he knows what Senator Mark Warner was doing behind the scenes. And I I I think he's out for blood with these guys. I hope so. I yeah, we all hope so. Like, and again, these are networks that are I mean, when you start to talk about this stuff, start to talk about this stuff in really historical context, you're talking about relationships and networks of people that are hundreds of years old. That's That's exactly right. So, here's the way I des This week it hit me. You go down a rabbit hole and you discover that you just hit Gobecley. [Laughter] Is he related to Vladepus? No. Gobecley Te is this 10,000y old city underground. This huge labyrinth. Oh, you got to look it up. Yeah. You've never you've never heard of Go? I have. Never heard of it. Oh, it's thisant. It's this. Oh, it's very You should Sounds like a Tolken invention. No, no, no, no, no. It turns out it's a huge underground city. In the olden days, you know, our images that they live up on castles on hills. No, they went underground. How do you spell that? G O B E K L I T E P E. It's fascinating archaeology. It's It's one of the most It's probably the most important archae Where is this place supposedly? I think it's in India, Turkey. No, it's it's in it's in that area. What's in the Middle East? Um, it's tied directly into it's tied directly into the 12,000 year disaster cycle. Say it again. Exactly. Graham Hancock thing. Say it again. All Graham Hancock, Ben Davidson, all that stuff. So, are there physical ruins of it? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. And interestingly enough, Joe Rogan had the leading Egyptologist on a couple weeks ago, and that guy has been the biggest gatekeeper of the of of the [ __ ] story that we built the pyramid by moving by moving rocks on sleds like which, you know, interestingly enough, I've my wife and I are my wife is obsessed with this stuff as well. And so I've heard, you know, I've been I've been down this rabbit hole. This is one of the rabbit holes I've been down. This is the hydraulic the hydraulic engineering. No, no, no. The whole the whole, you know, what are the pyramids? What's going on? Why are there all these underground ruins? Blah, blah, blah. We get into that. So, we don't have time for that today. Let's just that would take a month. What Dave is using to go back here as is a metaphor for how deep the rabbit hole of this goes. What I'm what I was saying is that and I I was having a I had a chat with Ian Berling game about you know um uh about the history of basically what amounts to the western conspiracy against humanity going back to the Dutch takeover of the of England and all this stuff. What you come to realize is like all this is happening and now we have an American pope. Where did that guy come from? Like and I and and and and I'm here to say my the jury in my mind is still out as to what that means. It could mean a variety of different things. We're not here yet. I've been I'm watching Italian politics very carefully because if if I see if I see the dismantling of the modern version of the Italian deep state at the political level, i.e. if Sergio Materella leaves the um the uh whoever replaces him as president of Italy will tell you a lot. But Italy is a very important fulcrum on the the future of European politics. Last week, this will be the tell if he reverses the excommunication of Vagani. Vagani the money guy in the Vatican. Vagatti is the guy who called out all the bad guys and called the world leaders pedophiles. There's there's one um another thing another is just on Materella remember Materella and Maloney and all that. What did we have last week? We had JD Vance, not the president, but the vice president, the least powerful person in Washington DC, the vice president fortify Georgia Maloney at a summit in Rome where they summoned who? Ursula Bonder. I love Maloney, by the way. Ursula of Wonderland. I know. She's phenomenal. I I I love her. And when I'm They summoned who? Ursula Vander Satan. Vonda Satan. Vander Satan. You mean Vander Lane? Vonda. That's my name for her now. She's Vander Satan. Vander Satan. It's like it's like queer Stalin like in in in England. He's Que Stalin. He's not you know. So these people are are such cartoon characters we have to create names for. So they're self memeing. They're self-meing. Yeah, they are. They're self-meing these people. Like so. Um, but Italy is very important because if we're if if if if I'm if my in my my instinct is on what Trump is trying to do with Europe is correct, what he's trying to do is destroy the the French, Germanic, Dutch cabal that has that runs Europe and city of London and create rump Europe by fortifying the northern Mediterranean coast i.e. by cleaving off Spain, Italy, fortifying Greece, blessing um Erdigans, take over Syria and Turkey and all of that because the goal is you take away their physical collateral. How you beat these people is you take away their access to physical collateral and their only and their only source of it right now after Trump just bought Ukraine with the with that quote unquote mineral deal and the fact that most likely there's going to be day between the United States and Russia that's coming the last thing left is Canada which is why they had to move more carney into Canada. You don't think Putin's upset with the mineral deal with Russia then? No not with Ukraine. Okay. No, here here's a funny one. Because Putin and Trump have already have have already cut a deal to have Russian ga to control the price of Russian gas going into Europe by having us buy Nordstream too and Gasprom and and Ros, you know, and have gas is very optimistic about a deal between US and Russia to dice up Ukraine and and amazingly he seems optimistic about a two-state solution on Israel. Now, here's there's a real and Trump made a note about this. Yes. Yes. And Trump all of a sudden seems to turn down on on Netanyahu. Have you has anybody else noticed that every time Trump's house somebody at the White House that struggle sessions aren't just for anti-communists anymore, but for actual communists. Every time he brings a communist into the White House, he does a 35 minute struggle session with him. He did it to Queer Stalin. He did it to to to Emanuel Macarron. He did it to the guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [ __ ] Netanyahu twice. So, here's a funny conspiracy theory. I was I've been I've been tracking uh you know the Macron married to a dude story, right? And I've been I've been tracking Candace Owens who's not stupid. And and at first I thought she was doing a comma. She was doing a uh um I thought she was going down some funny path. And it turns out that she's been able to piece together that Macron's um Macron's wife has an origin story that's very difficult to track. And her conclusion seems to be that Macron's wife was not only a dude, but Macron's father. That's bad. Yeah, I know. I saw that father. Macron's wife is Macron's father. That sounds like that old uh folk song I'm my own grandpa. That's an Asher diagram. It brings new It It brings new um It brings It brings new definition of the term Uncle Daddy. It It's like Do you know Do you know the conspiracy theory where where where so so they say Epstein's carcass wasn't Epstein? You know that one where it didn't look like Epstein? And I didn't think it did. And then they someone found a guy who looked just like Epstein who had died uh who looked just like the carcass who had died three weeks earlier. And it turns out there was no fanfare, no explanation. Just sort of quietly he went and went to the light. And it turns out it was Hillary's brother. I've heard that. Yeah. Oh, it really does look like the guy in the gurnie. And I'm sitting there going, you know, if I'm CIA and I got to find a body to to replace Epstein, I go, ""Oh, look at this."" You can see the guy sitting there over beer going, ""We have got to do this one. We've got to."" And so one of the one of the theories was it was a this is a gag, you mean? Well, or or a message to Hillary or as a message to Hillary. But but if you saw that relationship, you're going, ""Oh my god, we we can't pass on this. This is Hall of Fame [ __ ] for us."" Yeah. Really? And and I don't even care if it's right or not. is the funniest theory in history, right? Yeah. Yeah, I wrote about that one. That was a funny one. That was a really funny one. Yeah, it's about that time, Jim. But yeah, this has been fun, guys. Um, this the last point is like there's a lot going on. Watch Italian politics carefully here and watch the new pop. Yeah, thanks for the tip because I haven't been paying attention. M a couple a couple weeks ago, Materella came out and said he was old and he's tired and he was sick and he was like, I want out. And then the question and then and then the first name the the EU sends out there to replace him is Mario Draghi. Like he hasn't already [ __ ] up Italian politics enough, which is a big tell. And they got a deep bench. But if you get if you get if you get somebody I've got people in in in in Italy keeping me a breast of what's going on. If we get somebody to replace Materella at some point this summer. I hate that those guys. I hate London. then then we know who's in charge in Italy, which is that Maloney is finally in charge in such a way that she can actually affect real change and change the the political dynamic in within the EU and either upgrade Italy to be in charge, not France and Germany, or to set Italy up for the big escape. And as always, folks, dogs make everything better, even Dave's ugly Boston Terriers. You ever you ever you ever watch Maloney tear into Macron? I mean, beautiful. She she tears him to shreds. And then there was this great meme that showed Maloney and it was it it had this the sound effect was a race car going and it was it was imitating Maloney speaking. Look guys, you have to realize that this is something I I know about this. I've talked about it before. We don't talk about it on this show all when we get together all that often, but go back and look up the treaty of Karani from a couple years ago, which Materella signed around the prime minister, which effectively gave France the ability to invade northern and take control of northern Italy. We talked about that one day. We didn't talk about that. Jesus. And so Maloney [ __ ] hates Macron. She hates and Trump is crazy about Maloney. I thought Elon was I thought Elon was going for it, but he seems to be doing younger with Come on. Well, you got Ashley Sinclair, right? That was the Ashley Sinclair story is very complicated, Mike. It's all about sliding those DMs. He's all about I think I think Ashley's I think Ashley's MSAD. And then right when when that's surfacing all of a sudden there's a picture and I hate to say this because I like the guy and I really think he's very smart but there's a picture of Ashley with Mike Benz right I've never heard that what is what what are Ashley and Mike Benz doing together and you know Mike is a fountain of information so project I've always I've always looked at Mike as as kind of um as as advanced recon to tell you what we're gonna what we're going to be talking about next. He's got a team. Yes, he's got a team. Absolutely. All right, guys. Real quick, Tom, where can people find you? Tom, where can people find you? Uh, TFL1728 on Twitter and Patreon and Guns.

kCW_15nLsMk,25599,167,7,Mikey and JJ Are IMMORTAL in Minecraft (Maizen),20250525,"Let's go outside. I wonder what's going on out there. Huh? Someone has placed metal spikes on the street. It looks like they want to kill us, but they won't succeed because today we're immortal. In fact, we must punish those who put those metal spikes on the street. Yes, I agree with you. I'm very resilient. You can't kill me with that kind of nonsense. I can even prove it. I can easily swim in a lava lake. Let me show you. It'll be like a hot spring. I know that you can safely swim in the lava. We have a lot of hearts today, so we are very hearty and almost impossible to kill. It's so nice. Would you like to swim with me? It's really comfortable. H Mikey, let's do something more useful than swimming in lava. There's a golem house nearby. Let's go there. Oh, I want to compete with the golems. Imagine how cool it would be to make fun of the golems. They think they can beat everyone with one punch, but they can't. I love it. It's going to be really funny. All right, we've come to the house where the golems live. Hi. Let us into your house. We want to have a party. Hey golems, let us in or we'll beat you up. Do you know where you're going? You better get out before we beat you up. You've come to the wrong house. We're the strongest in the village. We can knock anyone out with one punch. Don't make me laugh. I'm sure that if you hit us, we won't even feel anything. Come on. You're going to try to hit me. And if it doesn't hurt, then you're going to let us into your house. What? Is that possible? I'll hit you again. You can't take the second one. That's the best you can do. I thought your punches would be strong. Come on, let's go to their house. And they can't even leave us. Come on, get out of our house. How dare you come in here. Let me hit you again. And if you can stand it. Great. I like it here. It's cozy. Great. Hey, I think the golems are having lunch. I'm starving. Thanks for the food. You're very generous. Are you trying to die? How dare you steal our food? Next time you should have sent a cake. I really like sweets. But in principle, you did a good job. Give me some more food. Otherwise, I'm not full. This is so much fun. Get it. Great. I told you it would be more fun here than swimming in lava. In fact, the golems have such a funny expression on their faces. When they couldn't hurt me, I didn't even have to hit them. They fell down from exhaustion on their own. I behaved brazenly on purpose to make them angry and I really did it. How I like to make fun of them. It was really funny. I haven't laughed like that in a long time. It was really funny. All right, let's go home. What have you done? I saw you beat the golems. Soon it will be night. And who will protect us then? Without the golems, our village will be destroyed. And it's all because of you. Maybe we can wake up at least one of the golems. Why did you even beat the golems? Who will protect us from zombies and marauders? Soon it will be night and the village will be attacked by monsters. We're sorry we didn't think of that. I'm sure there's still time before the golems wake up. Huh? It's getting dark so fast. That's too bad. Come on. We're all going to die. What are we going to do now? This is just awful. Well, since we're the reason the golems can't defend the village, we'll guard the village tonight. We have a lot of hearts anyway. So, we'll have no problem defeating all the monsters and proving to everyone that we're very tough. The zombies are coming soon, so we have to be on guard. Okay, I like your idea. It's going to be very funny. To be honest, I just wanted to fight against the crowd. Come here. You can't even scratch me. I can single-handedly defeat all of you. Great. It was even easier than I thought. The morning came so fast. The best part is we were able to defeat all the zombies with just the two of us. Although I knew we could do it, so I'm not surprised. All right, that's villagers. You are unbelievable. I still can't believe you could defeat so many zombies by yourself. I saw you fight. It was incredible. Take these emeralds. You deserve them. You're the strongest and toughest in the village. It's a good thing you're helping us out. Great. I love emeralds. Now I can buy something. To be honest, you're even stronger than the golems. We were able to defeat the zombies very quickly. The golems are awake, but they're still hurt. But I think next night they'll be fine. Huh? Mikey, get down from there. Why did you get up there in the first place? Or did you want to do a trick and jump off the roof? Listen, JJ, I see a bandit camp in the distance, and they're very close. To be honest, I don't have very good feelings. H Come here and see for yourself. If you don't believe me, go up the stairs. They're too close. I think they want to attack the village. Okay, I almost got in. It would actually be interesting to fight against the bandits. Mikey, if you decide to make fun of me like that, I will be very angry. H I'm a practical guy. Where did you see the bandit camp? There are two tents over there. They are near the village. It looks like they found out that the golems can't defend the village now and decided to try to attack. There are two robbers there. Let's go punish them. I'm sure it will be a lot of fun. Listen, Mikey, these are scouts. They came to find out what's going on in the village. If we beat them now, the bandits will come here. And if we let them go, bandits will come here anyway to loot the village. And what are we going to do then? Let's just find all the bandits and beat them. That's the best thing. You and I are very tough and we can beat them all. We don't know how many bandits there are. I think there could be a whole army of them and then it would be very complicated. What are we going to do then? What's the plan? I have one idea. We will make all the residents like us. They will have a lot of hearts and they will become very resilient. Activate the lever of the shirt. This device has made us immortal. Yep. You'll be amazed when the bandits come to this village. It's going to be unbelievably cool. Let's go through this device again. Then we'll become practically immortal. I actually like your plan. Although it's sad that we won't be unique. Okay, listen villager. The village will be attacked by bandits soon. To protect the village, you must go through this device. It will make you immortal and you will be able to defeat the bandits. You are very strong. So why can't you defeat the bandits? There are too many of them and they are very well trained. While we are fighting a part of the bandit army, another part of the army will destroy the village. So, we need help. All right, we'll believe you. If you say you can't do it alone, we'll help you. Especially if we want to protect our village. Well, I went through your device, but I'm not sure if it worked. I practically don't feel anything. It seems to me that nothing worked. Let's check it somehow. Well, if it makes you feel better, let's check it out. Stand against this wall and we'll shoot you with a real bow. You won't even feel the damage. Now you become the same as us. So, it's going to be very cool. You can fight forever. You won't get tired and you won't feel the damage. Are you guys sure you should be doing this? To be honest, I'm really scared. If you hit me with an arrow, I'll be dead for sure. Why don't you fight the bandits yourself? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. You're invulnerable now, so the arrow won't hurt you. We saved this village, so trust us. You also went through a device that makes you the same as us. What do you think? You didn't feel any pain at all, did you? Yeah, I didn't feel anything at all. It's just incredibly cool. I'm really immortal like you guys. Now I can beat anyone. Great. Now tell everyone else about it. Make sure everyone knows it's true. Then they won't be nervous. That's the best. Guys, it's all true. I've become immortal. If you pass through this device, you will also become immortal. And then we will be able to defeat the bandits. Yes. Without your help, we can't do it and we can't defeat them. So, please go through this device. You must hurry. Soon the bandits will come to the village and then they will destroy everything here. Great. Now we have the villagers on our side. Now we can definitely defeat these bandits. Let's hurry up and go to the place where the bandits camp was. I'm sure they will try to attack from this side. We will defeat these bandits and they won't dare to attack us anymore. You're right. There's a whole army of bandits coming towards our village. We must defeat them all. They'll be here soon. Great. You can't defeat us. We are now immortal and your attacks don't even damage me. We won't let you destroy our village. We will defend you. You picked the wrong village to rob. What a funny look on your faces. Great. The villagers are doing fine on their own without our help. The bandits have a funny look on their faces. They came here to beat the villagers and now they're beating them. We have a problem, JJ. Two scouts ran right under the attached one. We have to leave them before more bandits come to the village. Wait a minute, scouts. We'll catch up with you anyway. H We will bring an army of bandits here and then there will be nothing left of your village and then we will defeat you. Those bandits who came to the village were just the beginning. The rest will come here soon. Wait, cowards. You have nowhere to run. What? Where did you jump? I can't believe they jumped into the water from such a height. H I have a bow and arrow for just such an occasion. I can't let them run to the bandits. It'll be their punishment for daring to attack our village at all. They're leaving. You have to hit them. Great. You're very small. I can't believe you hit them from such a distance. Listen, what are we going to do next? What's your plan? H Let's go back to the village. The most important thing is that we were able to defeat these scouts and now they won't be able to call for help. A fire started in our village. Apparently, one of the bandits set fire to the village when he realized that he would not be able h to rob the village. The battle was on and we won. We were able to beat the bandits, but now we need to put out the fire before the whole village burns down. Let's ask that villager what happened here and where the fire came from. Listen, villagers, tell us what happened here. We were able to defeat the bandits, but then the bandits ran off in different directions. H I think one of them started the fire. Please help us put out the fire and kill the remaining bandits. Well, let's put this fire out first because I'm afraid it might spread to the houses and then the whole village will really burn down. Actually, I don't have a good feeling about it. So, we have to be on the lookout for any remaining bandits that might attack us at any moment. In fact, today was a crazy day. But the most important thing is that we managed to defeat almost all the bandits and that the village was not damaged. Mikey, help me put out the fire. I can't do it alone. There's too much fire. How would I help you if you hadn't noticed? By the way, I've already put out the fire. Listen, we have to find those bandits who ran away. They are somewhere in the village. I'm sure they are now thinking how to destroy and take revenge on the village. So, we must hurry. You'd better help me. You said you were putting out the fire, too. But for some reason, it seems to me that I'm working alone. In fact, I don't understand why none of the villager extinguishes the fire. It's not as difficult as it seems. Okay, it doesn't matter because I've already put out most of the fire, so I don't need your help. Although there's still a fire left and it needs to be put out. To be honest, I'm so tired. But I have to finish with the fire. Otherwise, if it is not extinguished, the fire will spread to the houses. Thank you for helping us. I don't know what I would do without you. You help us all the time, so we are in your debt. If you need anything, you can tell us. We will do it right away. I'm so tired, but I was able to put out most of the fire. Now, I'm sure the fire won't spread any further. Okay, now we have to find those bandits who ran away from the villagers. I want to teach them a lesson because it was because of them that I had to put out this whole fire. I know where they are. The bandits are putting TNT in the village. You must defeat them. If they blow up that TNT, at least half the village will be destroyed. Great. Now this village will be destroyed. Great. I've activated the TNT, and in a couple of seconds, the village will explode. You didn't stop me. I'll come back and destroy the other half of the village. I won't rest until I'm done. You can't leave me. I'm too strong. How come he's too fast? I didn't have time to hit him with a bow. How annoying it all is. He not only ran away, but also managed to activate TNT. It's good that I sorted it quickly and scared him off and he didn't have time to arrange TNT. You're very fast, Mikey. So why didn't you run after him? I thought you were going to hit him with an arrow, so I didn't run. Okay, let's see what happened to the village. H I wonder how badly the villager's house was damaged. The most important thing is that no one was injured and the house can be repaired. So, don't worry, villager. I just did the repairs yesterday. Why am I so unlucky? It's not fair. Although, I'm lucky the whole house didn't explode. I don't even have the resources to fix the house. What am I supposed to do then? We have extra resources at home. We don't need them anyway. So, we'll fix your house. Okay, let's hurry up, Mikey. Honestly, today has been a crazy day, and I want to go get some rest, but we have to help villager fix his house. I don't think that bandit attacked us anymore. I'm 100% sure of it, so we don't even have to think about it. Okay, I think these resources should be enough to fix Villager's house. H. We're lucky his house isn't too big, and we'll be able to repair it quickly. Look, I think the golems are getting better. We need them to guard the village from any looters, and so on. H, you're right, but let's focus on fixing the house now. We have brought resources. We will help you rebuild your house. We just have all the necessary resources for this. Your house is not very big, so we can do everything quickly. Thank you very much. I do not even know how to refine you. You always help the village. So, we all owe you a favor. When you fix my house, I will cook the most delicious pie in the world for you. You will definitely like it when you receive it. I've almost finished rebuilding the house. There's still some left. We were lucky that the robber didn't have time to set up more TNT. Then the whole house would have been destroyed. I have already completed the renovation in the floor area. Now you need to make walls and windows and then your house will be fully completed. In fact, you're lucky that I had the resources for your home at home. There's not much left. Great. I did it. I was able to restore the house. It wasn't as difficult as it seemed to me from the very beginning. Okay, today was such a hard day. I want to eat ice cream or pizza. What do you say, Mikey? Let's go to a restaurant. We have to go because we saved the village. To be honest, today was a really crazy day. The most important thing is that the village is safe and no one is threatening us anymore.",0.12,0.697,0.183,0.9997

As the rapper's federal trial for sex trafficking and racketeering continues, his former assistant, David James, shared that he often carried around 25 to 30 undisclosed pill bottles, including a set of pills that had the 44th president's face on them. James said on the witness stand Per People magazine, who had reporters in the courtroom, there were various pills, but one was in the form of a former president's face. And when asked to specify the former United States leader, James noted President Obama. E-News has reached out to Obama's team regarding James testimony, but has not yet heard back. Comb stash of pills, which James testified he regularly traveled with, also included vials of Viagra, Tylenol, Percoet, Advil, ecstasy, water pills, and pills to quote increase sperm count. According to NBC News, who also had reporters in the courtroom, James testified that his former employer also required at least $10,000 in cash amid his travels, adding, ""And sometimes much more."" Elsewhere in his testimony, James noted that Combmes required him to purchase baby oil, lubricant, and condoms with cash and would personally reimburse him for the purchases so they would remain off company books. And while James, who signed a profer prior to his testimony, noted that he did not find Combmes to be a gracious boss, he reached a point of no return in 2008 when he decided to vacate his position following an incident in which Combmes allegedly threatened music rival Suge Knight with firearms. Knight is currently serving a 28-year prison sentence for manslaughter following a 2015 hit and run. James said on the witness stand per NBC News of the incident, ""I was really shook up by it. This was the first time as his assistant that I realized my life was in danger. I told them I want to leave, but gave 6 months notice so I could train the next assistant. Comb's trial is expected to last until July. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has also maintained his innocence in separate allegations of sexual assault that have come out since his arrest. [Music]",0.074,0.85,0.076,-0.2597

Welcome to today's encouragement from our daily bread. Our reading titled Hope Renewed was written by Jasmine Go and read by Roshelle Trout. 1 Thessalonians 5:es 4-15. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep sleep at night, and those who get drunk get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath, but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him. Therefore, encourage one another and build each other up just as in fact you are doing. Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord, and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard and love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive. Encourage the disheartened. Help the weak. Be patient with everyone. Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else. Hope Renewed written by Jasmine Go. Theo was puzzled. Why was his 18-year-old son spending so much time in the library these days? His son, who was autistic and rarely spoke to anyone, would usually return straight home after class. What changed? When pressed, his son finally replied, ""Studying with Navin."" Navan, it turned out, was a classmate who'd noticed that Thea's son was struggling in class and had invited him to study together. This budding friendship, the first in 18 years, greatly encouraged the disheartened father who'd given up hope of his son ever having a friend. Hope was renewed because one person cared enough to come alongside another who needed help. In Paul's ministry to the early church, he knew this also applied to our hope of salvation. For believers in Jesus to be awake and sober, living in the hope of his return, they had to help one another, especially those who were struggling. That's why even though these believers led lives of love that pleased God, Paul reminded them to encourage the disheartened, help the weak. When we notice believers in Christ who are fearful, anxious, or despondent, and we come alongside them, whether to listen, offer a kind word, or sit quietly together, God can use us to give them the strength and courage to hold on to their hope in Jesus. Let's pray. Lord, please give us eyes to see and hearts to care for those who are struggling, offering them our support and our friendship. May we be instruments of your love to those who are struggling. Thank you, Lord. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. As you go about your day, reflect on these questions. Who in your community can you come alongside this week? What can you do to show them care and attention? [Music]",0.116,0.643,0.24,0.9986
rH_Onf5CybM,3932,975,105,Catch a Better Life - Daily Devotional and Fishing Tip May 25th,20250525,"You know, we see lots of fish now with our forward facing sonar. I use a Garmin forward facing sonar and it just works really well. Live scope and sometimes we can find schools of fish. You find several fishing, 15 or 20 fish in a school and a lot of times we find them, we can't catch them. But what's one thing that is pretty well given fact that will happen that will cause us to u to really have success with those fish? Something that you just do that causes causes them all to bite. [Music] Good morning, guys and girls. May 25. May 25. Chilly out here this morning. 61 degrees, I believe. I'm kind of cool myself. May 21. Reading from Revelation. Revelation 22:15. The last book in the Bible. This is talking about the end times. The end times. And it says, ""Outside the city are all the evil people. those who do evil magic, those who sin sexually, those who murder, those who worship idols, and those who love lies, and those who tell lies. Oh my gosh, we don't want to be in that group. What are you going to do when you retire? What are you going to do when you retire? I hear that question a lot. I've been hearing it for about the last 20 years. To a lot of us, including me, retirement means that we're going to go fishing. That's right. We're going fishing. I've got many retired friends who friends who fish almost every single day. I mean almost every single day unless the weather's really really rotten. Sometimes they even go to rotten days. Almost everyone I know who is anywhere close to my age is retired. Almost every everyone. The ones that are not thinking right off hand, Bill Dance and Roland Martin, and they're older than me. They're both five years older than me. The rest of us are dreaming of all those great spring days ahead when we'll fish away our retirement. [Laughter] We will fish away our retirement. God, I asked Chris uh actually recently, ""Honey, are you ready for retire?"" And she said, ""Yes."" I said, ""You want me to retire and be with you here every day at Twin Eagle Ranch?"" And she said, ""Yes, please."" And I told her, ""Well, I'll think about that. I'll think about that."" The ultimate retirement though, the ultimate retirement, it's not something that'll last 15 or 20 years, even a hundred years or a thousand years. It's forever. It's forever. The ultimate retirement is forever. And we have only two places to spend that forever in. We'll either be in heaven or we'll be in hell. My God, my God that I serve has made it pretty plain about who will spend their forever retirement with him and who will spend it somewhere else. He's left the choice up to us. You know, God won't send anybody to hell. I've heard it said, ""Why would a good, great, awesome God send somebody to hell?"" Well, he won't. He won't. He leaves that choice up to us. I know. I know he's guaranteed my retirement in heaven with him. How about you? You got that guarantee? Yeah. Here's our tip for today. We was talking about school and bass. Sometimes you can see schools of fish on your locator and can't get on a bite. If you can just get one bass in a school to bite. Sometimes just one bass in a school to bite, it often starts a feeding frenzy. So don't give up on them. If you can't get them to bite really quickly, don't give up on them. Try several different lures, several different techniques. If you've got a school of bass found, if you just want them to bite, it might turn on the whole school. I read a deal years and years ago about a guy that was skin diver and he would go down and locate these big schools of fish. Then he'd have his buddy try to catch them and he would go down there and video him catching these fish. And I read about one time when they found a big school of fish, 20 or 30 bass, and and his buddy was throwing the lure down there. And he'd go back up and he said, ""Your lure is going all around them. They're not paying a bit of attention to it. Not paying any attention at all."" And uh and he he go back down there and he'd throw some other lures and try different things. And pretty soon he said that those bass started like moving their fins a little bit more. They getting just a little bit more active maybe. And then they started opening their mouth and closing almost like they were yawning like they'd waking up or something, you know? and uh and and so anyway, they started moving around a little bit and pretty soon a bait come out and one of them bit it and then the rest of them sort of got a little bit more active and pretty soon he was catching them cast after cast after cast. So if you find a school of fish with your your life scope y gar don't give up on them. Make sure you give them a really really good try before you go elsewhere. Guys and girls, go out there and have you a great one. Fish are biting right now just about everywhere. Most of the fish in shallow water. Top water bites are beginning to pick up. Fish lucky. And remember, I surely love you.",0.057,0.785,0.159,0.9988

Oh, yeah. I know. I've I've read I've read everything so far. I've read everything so far. All right. Am I in the US? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Big I I I'm just Let's wait on on on the menntau because I saw the news of everybody traveling. Um he's supposed to go according to some people who know. So, I guess we'll find out soon um on that because he he should it'd be very strange if he doesn't considering the players who are going. Um he's supposed to anyway. Um will you be in New Jersey? No, I'll be in Chicago. I'm not going to go to the other games though in in the in the rest of the states. Um we'll see. We'll see. Um how do you get a Muppeteer's logo next to the game? Well, really good question. What you do is below the video there's a button that says what does it say guys? You tell me. Um because I actually don't know. It says to join and then you you kind of you kind of join and then like that's it. Um you click join. Yeah. Right below next to the thing and then you can become a member of the Muppeteers. So it is what it is. Um, but yeah, no, they released their official list and he's and and Menato's not on it, but I'm I'm a little confused, but uh um we'll see about that. Uh all right. Um we'll see what changes very short time. I will make a video with the guys on on uh on Paddock. I will make a video with the guys on the view in person. We'll be doing plenty of things this summer. Don't you worry about that. Um, obviously, you know, the first thing I actually wanted to discuss today was um the game a little bit because like I feel like it's it's worth discussing. Hang on. Go. Because like what the hell guys? Let me just refresh this really quick. Like what what happened? What happened? Where was this? Where was this on Wednesday? Where was this previously? Where was this? Where were you when we needed you with this performance? what happened? You know, I'm I'm it's it's it's uh it's mind-blowing, you know, and and I said in the pre-match that what did they want to do? They want Ruben Amarim wanted to put the same team out there that played in the final and have them show for it what they can do and show better than what they did in the final. and they came out and it was like what the hell man you know what the hell I mean look there was the same issues as ever that we'll talk about but this was an absolutely dominant performance from the team from start to finish you know um however ever. What I will say is it's the same thing as ever. We should have scored two, three goals before our first even happened. We should have scored a couple of games goals before the red card. This should have been a blowout of epic proportions. But this guy cannot [ __ ] score a goal. He cannot score a goal. And Mesa Mount can't either. Mason Mount was better today performance-wise, but he just can't put it in the net. He had plenty of really good chances to put it in the net. These guys don't score. And Ahmad Ahmad once again, once he moved out wide to the right wing back position in the second half, instant double on his influence on the game. Once we subbed um uh move subbed Dow Ahmad moved out wide instantly doubled his impact on the game from the wide areas. Um so you know it's like one Ruben next year don't [ __ ] this up. Don't [ __ ] this up. Stop putting Ahmad at the 10. Stop putting Ahmad at the 10. Okay. Put him out wide. um f first of all, but I I think we I think he will because we'll get to that because we're looking to sign three 10 three tens, not three tens, three forwards. Like I've been saying for for two weeks now, we want three forwards. We want three forwards, three forwards, three forwards, three forwards, three forwards. And it's being confirmed kind of left and right. So, the other thing I noticed, um, this looks crappy now from the substitutions, which is kind of frustrating, but I had a picture. Let me find the picture. Hold on a second. Let me find the picture because I posted it at halftime because I was really happy. Uh, I was really, really happy with with how it looked Midame. Um, it wasn't even actually Midame, but this is this this is it. Hold on. All right. Hold on. Let me make sure I do this right. This right here. This This is how it is supposed to look. This is how it's supposed to be in attack. 316 325. The same as any top team. You need to get box occupation. You need numbers. The first time we've seen these wing backs show the bravery that they should be showing where your midfield is staggered where your wing backs are getting forward and interplaying with the number 10's. This is what it's supposed to look like and your extra midfielders joining the attack. It's not supposed to be so defensive. Lewis, welcome to the promo bet. Thanks for joining, buddy. Appreciate that. Um, you know, it's this is what it's supposed to look like. You're supposed to have your right wing backs interplay with the 10ens. You're supposed to have that that because they're supposed to be wingers and then you're supposed to get those runners going through there. The 10ens were running into the channels all game. Mount was receiving the ball in the channels. Ahmad and Mazari receiving it in the channels. The the movements, everything was the way you wanted it to be. And it worked. You could see the box occupation. You could see everybody moving where they were supposed to. You could see the movement around the box. You could see the attacks, the angles we were creating, chance after chance after chance after chance for the tens and the forwards. And it was not all running through Bruno. That's one other thing I I want to make as an important point that I think is really necessary to to analyze. It was not all running through Bruno in the first half when it was all working, which is not, it shouldn't be. It's supposed to run from the wide areas into the middle, out wide, in, out, then in, out, then in, and it was doing that. Um, and then it and and it worked. And then when we got to 10 men, finally, you know, we could get the breakthrough from Ahmad making a crashing run at uh at right wing back. The crosses were there, the cutbacks were there. Um, the positions. This is rightwing back. Look at how high up Maz Rawi is. Maz Rowi has not been this high in his life. I know that cuz he's he's someone who doesn't uh drink or use substances as well. He has not been this high in his entire life. Look at how high up he was. This is a wing back playing wing back finally. Patrick Dorgu I thought was really good again. Look at this. This is a winger. This is basically a winger. This could have been, you know, Gacho's heat map for many games. Doru here. This is what you want. This is where you're supposed to be. And it was working. It was working. No, Hen would not have scored if Martinez didn't take him down, unfortunately. Um, this is where he's supposed to be. Uh, the [ __ ] that happens when there is no pressure. I know, I know, I know, I know. Um, anominous mango, sorry for being late, Yoko Cararish. We'll talk about Yokish in a minute. Yeah, I think Doru was really solid, you know, but I'm so just I I was actually really angry during the game for a large part because I was like, where were you guys, man? When we needed you, where were you? Mass was there when he played as a 10. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're right. Where were these guys, man? Where was this performance from so many of these players when it mattered? You know, that's really disappointing to me. But that's kind of where I'm I'm sitting there going, maybe we do blow it up. Maybe we do because I feel like it's tainted. I feel like this this club, the locker room, I feel like the personnel, like the people involved are just they're tainted. You know what I mean? Like they can't do it. Um Steuart 10 memberships. Joe Shepard, Bando Boys, Ronnie, Leo, Conor, MA. No, Warren Ma. Thank you. Uh first MKO, Sammy Ball. Hey, Sammy one ball. I look Hey, that's my guy. Jonathan Ball. Hey, look. There's a second ball for you, Sammy. Uh, thank you, Stuart, as always. You're amazing, man. I really appreciate that. Um, that's awesome. Thank you so much. But yeah, I mean, I I it's really like um it's really it just it it it's it's frustrating. But I do feel as though you look in the dressing room and you think it's people who they don't have it in them. They just don't have it in them. I I I don't I don't know what the deal is. Um, but I really do worry that, you know, we just I don't know, man. There's something wrong and I think it's hard to to move um forward with some of these players. I was really impressed with Aiden Heaven as well, by the way. Top top top player. really impressed with him again. He's so good. His body shape, the way that he defends, the way that he pushes players off the ball without fouling. Absolutely. You can see it. The pace to get back, the coverage, the legs. Aiden Heaven is the total package as a center back. I am so impressed with him and I can see why um you know, we haven't seen like a huge push for a center back as of yet. Scott Harrison, James, there's an issue with your join button. For example, the button is not visible on other channels homepage. Uh, I'll check that out. I don't know. I don't know why. Maybe it's my location though. Maybe that matters. I really don't know. Hello from London. Um Um, just remember I shipped out 17 players. He looks amazing for the type of money, you know, that he is. Um, it's it's it it is really really special to see that. You don't really that is a steal and a half of a player. You you can see it. He's played in the Premier League now and it's like great and he's fine. I think it was a pretty much a pre-planned substitution anyway. He went down, came off, sprinted back on, played, continued. He'll be fine. He's only had one injury, guys. He's not injuryprone. He's had one injury that he had to work back from because he had some like, you know, just it just didn't fully Angles can be tricky. Ankles can be tricky. You got to be careful with them. I think the rest after the, you know, for the for the next four or six weeks will do well for him. Um, you're in the US as well. I'll check it out, Scott, but I truly have no idea to be honest. May depend on the browser. I I actually have no idea if you're using a VPN or something. I don't know. Um, but no, I was I was upset. And and the other thing is that I would say is that like when you look at it, uh, it was nice to see Erikson get a penalty as a sendoff. Um, Dallow got 26 minutes. That's all good. Um I thought Cheeto was, you know, in there. But the other thing that bothers me, um, exactly. We have Flip. We have some base of this team for five plus years. Except the Bruno money. Rebuild six players for the 11. We could have similar next year. I agree. I agree. I I also agree, Lewis. We took too many random shots. I totally agree with that. But this is this is my thing that I've been saying for a while now that I truly believe. I watch us play Chelsea, I'm not impressed. I watch us play City, we go toe-to-toe with them. I watch us play Arsenal, we go toe-to-toe with them. I watch us go into Anfield, we go toe-to-toe with them. Newcastle ran all over us to be fair. That the we we started Erikson in the midfield. It was just a disaster, right? We play Aston Villa, we win. We play Forest, we should have won. We play Brighton, I think we got spanked by Brighton. We play Bournemouth, I think we should have won that game as well. We drew, right? Um, we play Brenford, we come back. I I just look at it and I think we actually looked better against a lot of these teams in the last few months playing the last time we played them than worse. You know what I mean? I thought we looked good against most of those teams really outside of Newcastle because Newcastle just destroyed us. We looked good against Liverpool, Arsenal, City, Chelsea, Aston. In in many cases, you could argue we were the better side in those games, couldn't you? I think we should have beaten Arsenal. Um it was David Reya had an insane performance. Man City, we should have won that game. Chelsea, they were nothing special at all, like at all. You know, we had Yeah, we did have higher xG in most of those. Outside of Newcastle, I really don't think we were that much worse. But my point is is not to cope and say, ""Oh, well, then we're good enough."" My point on it is that um my point on that is that we um there's not that much gap between all of these clubs. There's just not that much gap between them. We're not better than them because we can't get the job done. Even if it's just because of a striker, even it's just because of a goalkeeper, it doesn't matter. They're still part of the team. In in the Arsenal game, David Rehea saved it their ass and ours didn't. We didn't make good saves. You know what I mean? So, that's still our players. So, we don't deserve it. Another positive is our half record goes on. Yes, it does, Dwayne. Good point. So, we Yeah, it doesn't mean we're better than them because it means our striker's worse, our goalkeeper worse, but we're not that much worse. I know the gap is 30 points. Well, it's not 30 points, it's 20 points. But it's sort of like how many onegoal games, how many draws, how many close, you know, things in there were there that that led to that situation. It's just it's just crazy. Who gifted me a second ball? Thank you. There you go. With the right five or six pieces, we should be top six or close. A striker tends. Yeah, I mean, I agree with all of that, but again, it's not that we're better than them, but I don't think the gap is that big. Kieran, welcome to the the Pro Muppet. I just don't I really don't think the gap is that big between all of these teams because whenever we go head-to-head, I'm not impressed. I'm not impressed. Obviously, over the course of the season, a lot of them are able to sustain things in a better way than we are, and that's a problem. That's about squad depth and thing like that. But with a game a week next year, all of our focused on the league every single week, then we'll see. Exclusive semiball merch coming hopefully soon. I would like us to get to 65 points to 70 points next year. Yeah, these guys did this in one season as well, you know, from like 17th or whatever. Um, but yeah, I would like to. So, it's an interesting it's an interesting one. I think that what you saw today is a big big middle finger to the idea that this system can't produce chances, that the system can't be attacking, that the system cannot control games, that the system cannot create sustainable chances, that it's long ball only, that it's individual brilliance only or things like that. We created so many good chances in this game that were all really quite ordinary, sustainable, somewhat boring chances. Cut backs, crosses, the things you want to do all the time. It's about personnel. It's about performance. You've got to have athletes at the back that pick up when someone runs on the break and they get through the initial press. You need these wing backs to be very brave, to get high up the pitch to win it quickly. Um, you need the press organization to be right so that you can counter press and sustain your attacks. Um, I hate possession systems because if you don't score, keeping the ball don't matter after. Just like going unbeaten and not winning the final. Mhm. Agreed. So, I don't think that it it it particularly matters. I think that it's up to the players to perform. We need them to perform. We need them to do the business for this system to work. We just have to. And we need a better keeper. We got a little lucky. Like because you know what's crazy, right? Let's let's let's let's be honest for one second right here even though we should have been winning this game. Villa very easily could have had a goal and it could have been one zero at that point with the mistake by by India. I I'm I'm I'm I go back and forth a little bit because technically the ball was between his hands, but you can't really complain if that had been a goal for Aston Villa, even though we've had tons of chances up to there, you know. Um you can't really complain. It you know, it was it was like we could have been losing this. This could have been easily another 1-0 loss. Easily. Because we couldn't take our chances and we made a mistake out the back. It's the same story every single game. We got a little lucky this time. It's a goal, right? You guys think it's a goal? Like, let's let's pull that real quick. What do you guys think? Yeah, I don't know what the hell he was doing, but I think it's a goal. He kind of had his hands on it, but I think it was a goal. I'm I'm I'm not going to lie. I cannot see a world where that isn't a goal. I know, technically not a goal, but it seems like a bad call. Like if they hadn't blown the whistle, V would have turned it over. Like he had his hands around it, which is technically the rule if it's two hands on it, but he didn't have control. Yeah, he lost control of the ball. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, most people think it was a goal. So, I agree with you. And I think that what that what's scary about that is that point being um you know the point being is that we could have very easily been down 1 zero despite performing way better. And then what would the narrative be? Oh, this [ __ ] system, you know, this [ __ ] thing doesn't work. We can't create chances. We can't score goals. You can't coach a win in the Premier League. down against 10 against 10 men concede, you know, but come on. You know what I mean? Like, come on. This is the reality. [Music] Um, this is the reality. So, you know, this is the reality. This is the point being we need a keeper because that mistake could have cost us. But this is what has happened so many times this season. missing chances up front and mistakes like that out the back and you can't survive that kind of [ __ ] Um, uh, Alberto Madrid for 50 million over a matter of time. Well, they just finished their thing, but let's let's take a look at something here. This is the table for the league for the year. Based on XG, we had a higher chances created by a fairly significant number um than Nottingham Forest. Look at this. We created almost 4 and a half more expected goals, but we scored 14 fewer expected goals. Not amazing, but obviously not as bad as our record would indicate on the season. Um, and we need to do a lot better. I'm kind of interested if you go from like here, what does it look like? Yeah. I mean, if you go from here, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. If you go from here, we've earned five points during this period, but created the 10th most chances and defensively we were one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. You realize how crazy that is? Since March 18th, um, we conceded the eighth fewest chances and had we had the eighth worst defense, eighth, eighth best defense because we're in the top 10 and the 10th best chance creation and we got five points. 17th 18th most points. So during this period, we should have been like eighth or ninth in that in that period with the same squad and we finished and we got 18th in in these in these point in in our points during this period of time. That's wild, man. That's absolutely wild to me. That is absolutely crazy just how badly we've underperformed during this period of time. Look, we have a positive goal differential on expected and we have minus7 minus 7 and we lose a final the same way. Our expected points was 14. Well, there's the best way to look at it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. Our expected points was 14. Our expected points was eight. Eight. and we got 18th during that period of time. That's crazy. That's pretty crazy, you know. It's It's just crazy. We lost the final because we couldn't break down Spurs. Yeah. I mean, and they kind of knew it, but we can't score. We can't score. Creating once we're already down doesn't mean it's not true, you know? It's just it is what it is. Um Oh, I know. There was a point like what 65 minutes Amram looks so pissed. Kick he kicks the water bottle. He's so upset about it, you know, like it's just it's it's wild. It's wild. But I got to say this about it, like the whole the whole the whole thing. Um this is my view on it. All right. Um and then we'll talk about some transfers, we'll talk about some news, we'll talk about things like that that are that are going on. Um, a second. I apologize. Just um anyway, um, what was I going to say? This is my view in general. Okay, here's where I'm at. Scott Harrison, welcome to to the promo. I appreciate you. Um there's enough to me evidence across multiple games, especially big games, big performances, Liverpool, Anfield, um some of those games like that, this this one to end the season, there's enough evidence to me that the system can work, that it can compete in big games away to Bill Bao, away, you know, Leon, these all of these these games that the system can work, can create chances. How good it can be, we don't know where it will be, where it will end up, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need a major reset at United. We need a major reset at United in terms of the squad. When you're talking about culture, you're talking about players who shouldn't be here, players who need to leave, players who need to change what they're doing, all of that. Um, you talk about playing in a final and putting in stinkers and then going into the final day against a team that's trying to get Champions League and performing extremely well because you cannot know whether a system is going to make it or not. But it doesn't matter. You don't know if the coach will make it or not. But it doesn't matter. It doesn't actually matter because you know you need to change the team. You know you have to change the team. That is inexorable. You it has to be done. The team has to be ripped up. It has to be changed at its core. It has to be finished. It has to be fixed. It has to be beaten. It has to be rebuilt. Whether Amarim is a good enough manager at the end to win you titles is not the question at the moment. Actually, the question at the moment is who is the right manager to oversee a rebuild of United and to lay down principles. And of that, Ruben Amram is the right guy. And of that, Ruben Amram has done it before. And of that, Ruben Amram has rebuilt a team that hadn't won in 20 years to now become easily the powerhouse in Portugal. There is a like he said three games in, he saw it immediately because it's about changing the way so many things are happening. Some of that's changing, you know, just changing players and all that. Some of that is, you know, the way that you you do things, but the patterns, the the actions, the way that things are done. But it but his speech, like he said, he said, you know, after three games, and I think it was a great speech. Um, but I think because he means it and there's truth. He said that there was going to be storm and now he says it's going to be the good times are coming. He gets it. He gets it and he knows what it takes. And one of the biggest factors in this is this matter of, you know, athleticism of being able to deal with the Premier League. And there is a big focus on Prem Proven as we can see. Um, you know, we go for here, let's take a look. Um, we're going for goal scorers. Well, you've got Kuna, the eighth highest goal scorer in the Premier League with six assists on the season. We're going for him. Um, Brian Bumo, number five on the list. Number five on the list with 20 goals, seven assists. We're very interested in him. Um, and then you move down the list. All right, Liam Dap. Fine. He's 16th on the list in terms of 12 goals. But here's the issue, right? Where do you find your first United player? Let's see. We're on page two. Any United players? Page three. Any United players? Page four. There you go. Bruno Fernandez with eight goals. 34th. So you're talking about getting in terms of targets two three players who are significantly better than um anybody else right now. MT welcome to the prouppet. Thank you. Uh significantly better than anyone else uh that we could get. anybody else in our team right now. Massive amounts of goals. Even if we went for Jean Philippe Mateta for striker, by the way, which I'm not against, he's a good player. If we couldn't get Dilaper Yokerish, even if we ended up targeting him, he's still on the first page of goal scored. Like, we're talking about players who are in a different stratosphere to ours. It's embarrassing. You know how many pages you have to go to find our striker? Here we go. Let's see. Page page n 10. Page 10. 92nd in the league. Our striker with zero assists. 92nd. You understand that? You understand that there are there are there are only if you if you just pick the front three, not even just strikers, there are 91 players better than Rasmus Handland in terms of goal scoring. It's an embarrassment to this club. Not him. I'm not I'm not even trying to say like he's an embarrassment. I'm saying it is an embarrassment that this is what we've ended up with in a situation where our striker is 92nd in the league in goal scoring. Our striker I mean maybe you could how do you maybe I could filter it like how do I filter this? Is there a way to filter by like oh yeah forwards. Let's go. All right. How close is he to the front or back on in terms of forwards? Okay, there's 13 pages of forwards. So, he's on the he's 29th as far as forwards go. So, that means that there's like 60 midfielders who've scored more and defenders who've scored more goals than than Rasmus Hilen. I don't know, man. I don't know what to say. It's It's shocking. It's really, really shocking stuff. Um, he's just far out of his depth, you know. I mean, look at the players above him. Ataro with 620 minutes. Oh, it's pretty crazy. Oh, you know what? I'm actually looking I just realized I It's actually worse than I just did because I was looking at the wrong dates. No, no, no. That was just above. Never mind. No, we're good. We're good. But it is crazy. It is crazy. I thought I was looking at the wrong dates. I thought it was even worse, but it's not worse. Um, you know, look at the minutes of the players below him. These are guys who don't play football. These are part-time footballers. You see that? These are part-time football. The closest is Anthony Gordon, but at least he has six and five assists to go with it. It's 11 versus four. You know, these are But below him, it's part-time footballers, basically. It's embarrassing, man. And that but that's where we are. That's the That's the reality of it. That's why we are where we are in the table. That's why we finished the season where we are in the in the in the table. Um, you know, that that's the crazy part. Uh it's it's quite it's quite incredible. You said uh somebody said what what did you want me to do? Uh you wanted me to sort it by non-penalty xG. Now I mean I don't think I can actually but I mean uh let's do how do we how do we let's go a,200 minutes so we get like some starters in here. [Music] Um, XG per 90. Could do that. Oh, you know what? Some people are being classified as midfielders. I just realized that. What is going on with this? What did I do wrong here? Oh, you know what? I just realized why that filter isn't working. It's because it's only considering games that they're classified as a forward when sometimes they're classified as a midfielder. Those three possibly Yokish makes a big difference. Agreed, Owen. Agreed. Reuben knows the aura farming tactics. I trust him. Yeah, Dwayne. Exactly. Exactly. I was like, why does this look weird? Like, what what am I missing here? I'm getting it wrong. Something's wrong with that picture. I'm surprised at how high up Mateta is on the XG per 90 table, by the way. Pretty wild. We're at the crazy madness. Um, but anyway, there's Ahmad with eight and six. That's not bad. So, regardless, I think it makes a big difference. Makes a huge, huge difference. Whista is really good, too. Whissa is doing amazing work over there, isn't he? Incredible stuff. Yeah. Look, I mean, look, you can you can look at people's overperformance and stuff like that. But then, you know, if you look at it by minute, he was improving upon last season's numbers. Is it sustainable at 20? Uh, probably not. Probably not. Is he Is he over overperforming a bit? Probably not. But these are really good numbers for what it's worth. Like you're talking 17 goal contributions, 15 like these are still good numbers. It's not like Ambuma like 20 goals is a wild number. If he gets 13 and if he gets 15 to 20 goals and assists, that would be great. Uh that's fine with me. You know, whether he's overperforming or not is all good. Same goes for Kuna. If you look at Kuna, he's actually, you know, he's overperforming on his goals pretty heavily, but he's actually slightly underperforming on assists. You still, you still have to produce. Um, I don't think they're necessarily like one season wonders. Whissa's actually underproduced, which is pretty crazy that he's been able to do that so much this year. We need power and technique in midfield, not just attackers. I like to see him go after Battle, but no, I don't think we'll do that. Um, is Ederson number one target for the midfield? I I think so. I think so. Um, yeah, good finishers overperform, bad finishers underperform. It's pretty normal. But yeah, look, I mean, regardless, the truth of the matter is, so here's where we're at as of today. All right. Um, here's where we're at as of now. Look at this whole team. I gotta do the gotta take the picture for the team. I mean, they're all flying. Um, it's pretty funny. Uh, sorry. Just noticed they post like this big old picture flying to uh flying to Malaysia. Some of them smiling, a lot of them not smiling. It's kind of cracks me up. Um, anyway, sorry, I'm getting really distracted. If I'm not going to improve as defending, right-wing back is his. Yes. Yes, I agree. Um, I I completely agree. Um, but look, so what's the where are we at today? All right. Where are we at today? Number one, it is they're flying out right now. They're flying right now. So, because they've committed to this tour. Look, this is a press and marketing and money tour. Okay, that's the reality. It's a tour to go out and see the fans in Asia, wake up at crazy hours to watch the game who commit to United. You know, it's it's to do that. Yes, there's money to make. Yes, of course, there's money to make. Obviously, it's for the money, but at the same time, it's good to go out there and see the fans. And they've got events. Some they're doing events in India. Onana, Maguire, Dalo, I think are going to India to do something like they're there to represent the club and to sure, you know, help with the fan base. You know, they don't deserve a rest. Who cares? They can sleep on the plane. They'll be fine. You know, this is how you end the season is one more week of work, then you go on holiday for a while, then you come back and train. Not a big deal. They'll be fine. Don't worry about them. A lot of kids there, a lot of people to travel. It's just respecting the fan base and it makes money. Where we are right now, Kuna is essentially done. We've kind of we've known this for a long time. Um we've known this for a while. Basically agreed all of the terms a week ago. We'll be playing paying the clause um very shortly for him to get done um this week. He should be ready to go. That's never been in question. Kuna is going to be joining United for that position on the left 10. Um the second forward Dilap or Yokerish. Um Dilap will be as we knew before the end of June basically making his decision on where he wants to go um on who he wants to join and we'll find out what happens um from there. We don't know. uh yet who he who he's going to inform and all of that. Should he not pick United? Obviously, Yokerish is one we're going to really need to try to do. Um uh uh Alvo Fernandez, Alvo Carreras, the money that's coming apparently from that is very likely to help us uh to pay some money to give us a bit more revenue to to buy players. Um, you know, so we will see. I'm But United want to try. That's That's what I've been saying. They want to try. Yokerish uh Sporting just finished their final cup game. Um, Yokerish scores in the 100th minute. Draws a penalty when they're down 1 zero. Scores in the final minute of the game to get a penalty to score to draw it level. Sporting go on to win in extra time. Absolutely amazing. Look, end of the day, this is I I'm I'm almost I I this is why I said before, like I I really truly believe that analysis can just go too far. This is a guy who scores an unbelievable amount of goals. And the thing that you cannot teach in football is what would be the what's the I'm trying to think of the word because I've described it so many times. What is the the word for it? It maybe it's determination. Maybe it's it's it's that mental magic that happens that players have where it doesn't really matter. You can you can you can analyze them all you want. It doesn't matter. They can have weird fundamentals. They can have weird quirks. They can have all these things. But but you cannot teach the determination and just Instinct is a part of it. But I think instinct is a is a very definable skill. It's more than that. Some players just have it. They just make something happen when it's time and when it's needed and when it's needed most. They just get it done. And it's like it's like it is like magic. It's like they just always have it. It's like, you know, it's like Jordan in the playoffs. like you just that just just happens at a certain point, you know, and there's nothing you can do about it. Um, and Yoko Carerish has that. Nobody scores that kind of goal, those numbers of goals and the situations that he scored in big games and all of that without having it. You know, it's like someone was telling me he had a bad game when he scored a hat-tick against Man City. I don't give a [ __ ] He had a a hat-tick in the Champions League against Man City. It's It's just there. It just happens, you know? Like I don't care if he plays bad. Clutch. Yeah. Clutch. Yeah. You know, it's like I you if a guy can play bad but still manage to get a hat-tick in the Champions League at Sporting against Manchester City, then all that tells me is that that's someone who just is going to make it work. He's just gonna make it happen because I'm watching guys have bad games and not score and I'm watching guys have good games and not score. I just want a guy who puts the ball in the net no matter what. You know, and that is to me where where analysis goes too far because you cannot measure I'm going to channel my inner I'm gonna I'm gonna channel my inner Philip De Bruyne on this. All right, my good friend. Um they're human beings. They're human beings gen. And you cannot measure human beings that way. There is a drive, a determination, and a mental aspect that you just cannot beat when it's there. And people miss that. People miss that. Um, you have to do it. Um, uh, and and and I think it's I think it's cra it'd be crazy to miss out on a player like him. It would be crazy if we have a chance. If we have a chance. If you have a chance. Oh yeah, my accents are absolutely terrible. But it would be uh it would be crazy to miss it out. Human beings jeans. But yeah, Portugal is a good league to buy from, too. And and it's it's all good. Um [Laughter] Um Oh, man. But yeah, you can't measure certain things. It's called intangibles, right? It's intangibles. People, we talk about that in sports a lot. We hear about intangibles a lot in the US. Um, in America, they always say intangibles and that you cannot measure the intangibles. There are players who just have it and there are players who don't. Um, and the intangibles, you you the numbers that he's producing and the moments that he's producing are on another planet. And I think that it would be a shame to miss out on that. I think it would be an absolute shame to miss out on that. I do not see the intangibles. Dilap's been really bad for the last couple months, too, by the way. Really bad. Like shockingly poor for a couple of months. That is concerning. Um yeah, I really I Manto must be injured because he was supposed to be going on this tour. He must be injured. must um he has to be injured. He was supposed to go on this tour. Um he should be there, but he he must be injured. I I don't know what else to say about it. Um so yeah, must be something in that. Very very strange. He pulled out of the Euros. No, he pulled out of the English the England team also. So I it just must be an injury or something. I I don't know what the what the issue is, but it must be that um cuz he should have been ideally around the first team a bit more towards the end and you know, but uh it must be injury related or something unfortunately. But we'll see. I'm sure he'll be able we'll see him in in July hopefully. Hopefully we'll see him in July. Um regardless, but yeah. Um Kuna Dunn, striker, that's the situation we should find out from Dilap next week. Yo Carish will want to be letting people know of his decisions after this after Sunday. Um I don't know how Yokerish screams bust. He's doing numbers that nobody who has not been literally great of the game have done. Literally he's doing numbers that only the greats have done. Messi, Ronaldo, Luendowski, um, Zlatan, like the numbers he is reaching, nobody has done except all-time great players. If it was like anyone could do it, then others would be doing it. Nobody's doing it. Nobody's 83 or something goals and assists in a [ __ ] No, 73 in a season. Are you kidding me? That's insane. Insane. Insane. So, the striker situation is there. Mateta still an option, you know, as well that could be looked at. Um, when you look at, you know, that then we also want a third 10. Uh, a third a third forward, another 10. Um, another 10 in there. Um they were absolutely not Jardell and Hulk were absolutely not doing it. I I mean people are you people are not really understanding um this the scope the scope of these numbers man like you're not you're not getting the scope of it when when you say he was people were doing those kinds of numbers. First of all, here let's look let's look at let's look at let's look at Hulk for example 36 right very good no doubt first of all that was back in 2010 2010 okay 15 years comparing the leagues by then is is is whatever um that's like half you know that's like half of of What? What do you mean Jardell was doing it? Am I missing something here? What am I missing? Did I get the wrong Jardell or something? Um, but like this that was Bastos was not even close. And and he's not actually a bum. I mean, that's kind of the funny part. Bastos is not a it's not a bum. He did get 34 in the league at one point back in 2016. 38 total, which is pretty impressive, not gonna lie. But he was not a bum though. He never got a move. He was 27 years old at the time. He scored he had a 20 goal assist in Germany before that as well. He had 39 in the Dutch League, you know, but he was pretty good. So, we want um Darwin Nunes hit about half and it was again it was it was one season. It was one season and you have to also factor in Champions League. You have to factor in all of those performances, too. Uh, how does it not concern you that the club's way better than us who also need a striker don't want him? That's my one concern. I mean, does it matter? Club's way better than us. Didn't didn't do didn't sign Lenoro, you know, and we got him, you know, Madrid put it off and we got him, you know. Um, the other thing I would say again that I just really want to point out with Yokarish is look at the trend from the Championship through this is not like something crazy. He's doing unheard of numbers and in the Champions League, but he's also been improving year over year over year over year over year consistently. If you look at these other ones, that's not the case. Arsenal does want him. Um, Artetta doesn't. Um, other clubs may want him, but you know, going for different targets, different money, different priorities. A lot of clubs have strikers. Newcastle has a striker. City have a striker. Um, you know, it's just weird. I I don't know, man. Like, why did nobody else try to buy Xiao Nez, you know, people, you know, it's like, does that make him [ __ ] just because PSG got him? They have a tricky track record. Dembele was a flop, you know, and now he's Ballindor, you know. Rafinho was leaving leadeds and people said, ""Oh, he's shit."" Um, I mean, it's it's whatever. Um, but we don't know, you know, regardless, it it doesn't matter. Um, it's a sort of an an irrelevant point on it. Um, so we'll see. So, you know, it it doesn't matter to me. Those types of things don't really bother me at all. Um, so then there Yeah. Then the third the third forward the rightsided 10. Uh Brian and Bumo, Brian and Bumo, um uh Tyler Dibling, uh Antoine Semeno. Now, if you move to S for Semeno, I still feel Semeno more strongly fits into the right wing back profile of player rather than the right 10. Um um yeah, but similar similar there and and and the interesting thing is they're all like fairly proven, you know, players proven in the Premier League or proven, you know, in in Amaram system before and things like that. Um, but you know that's the start of where we want to go. Um, and I think that that's really really impressive. So like if we looked at what our targets wanted now I don't we can get that without even selling um Bruno right now like here we can we can look like if we can do this right just we'll just look at the starting 11 for a moment. Um, if we can do this, um, let's just say we can afford this with Alvaro or something. We sell Ganacho, we can get Embo. You know, I guess the thing that's sort of a little bit odd when you look at the players. If you're going for Abumo, then what happens to Bruno? Are you playing him deep all year? Because I think that would be a huge, huge mistake. Um, I mean, Ugarte and Bruno actually worked pretty well, but Ugarte hasn't been playing at the end of the season, so we don't know. Ederson Bruno would definitely not work. Uh, for me, that that that's a that's an absolute no. Um, Ederson is is is much more attacking you. And I don't think you have the money to buy some big deep um midfielder. I don't think he can be deep in the midfield. This is a lot of money to spend on a player who may not play there, you know. So, I'm a little bit confused. I'm a little bit confused on on that basis. If if if like you can have good players, I totally agree, but if you're going that big on like Embumo, then I don't think it works. I don't I don't see how um I don't see how it works. That's that's kind of my biggest question at the moment. Um I'm again going to run this out and I think this is this is the direction of travel at the moment. You know, let's say you go for like then we definitely need a keeper. There's just no doubt about that. We kind of don't know this yet. Um, do you do you not get inbumo? Do you go for someone younger? Do you you keep if you keeping Bruno here? Uh, who are you putting here? Do you go do you try to buy Dibling as a young player? Now, I don't think you should be paying 80 million or something like that. Um, but if you can get him for 40 to 50, would they want to do that? Because he's really highly admired as well. And do you just run with this? Is this what you do if you cannot get dibbling? I don't know. Ahmad is is is just so ineffective at right 10 in comparison to wing back. So ineffective comparably. These are the questions we don't quite have the answer to that we're going to find out tomorrow or the next day or in the next couple of days. Um, will Bruno stay or not. Um, we don't know. We don't know. Uh, and how does that change things? We just don't know yet how it changes the whole setup, how it changes the whole structure of things. Um, these are definite definite unknowns. Um, it seems unlikely that Bruno would leave, but I'm what I'm wondering here is are we baiting out the are we baiting out European moves now? Because this this is what I've wondered for a while. Like if we're looking at it and saying, ""Oh, yeah, he might be willing to go uh to, you know, to be willing to leave or he's considering it."" Is it going to bait out moves to Europe instead? Um I don't know. I don't have the answer to that. I don't take stock much in the public public talk over things in terms of indications on what people are going to do in their careers or things like that. It it's you know it's dangerous to do so by wrote a whole big letter about how he's going to be here next year. That's unlikely. Um you never know. You know, two weeks ago, people were telling me that Amarim loves Carnacho. Well, I told you. Six months ago, people said we were definitely not going to get a keeper. I told you. Like, you can't take too much stock in what is said publicly at any point in time. Like you say, like if we didn't have a report about Gacho being kicked out, then people would be looking at him on the plane and saying he's he's with the team. he's he's he's staying for the long haul, you know. Um I don't think that's true. Well, obviously it's not true in the case of Garnacho, but it's a question because like if you were going to start me off next season with what we're just able to get, I mean, what we're able to get without anything else. This is where we would be in my opinion for the right like the best pairings I think would be this way. Um, which is still better. uh you know with another year under everybody's belt and all of that. Um so the question becomes where we go from here. Do we buy a backup? I understand what Amaram said, but it it kind of doesn't matter, you know, like you guys forget cicada sequa cicada, you know, like it doesn't matter. People say [ __ ] everybody makes their decisions. Um, this is the present. If we can get a striker, Yokerish or Dilap, right? Um, then we just don't know yet based on Bruno. We need to know is he staying for sure or not? because we'll either be buying, you know, a backup or if he stays, we have to buy a starting 10, but then we don't have the money for a midfielder. You understand that? Like, if we just sell Garacho and we buy Embo, we don't have the money for a midfielder. No, Hamza. No, you know, we don't have the money for a midfielder. If you sell uh just Garnacho and buy like Embumo for this, who we're interested in, there's no money for a midfielder. So, what are you going to do? Nobody's nobody with any relevance has said we're selling agarte unfortunately. No matter how much you want to cope on that when somebody says it then we'll talk about it. Nobody has said Ugart is for sale. You do realize that. So you you can you can you can make whatever up in your head that you want. Nobody has said that Ugart is for sale. If you can link me somebody of any sort of relevance saying it, not people making it up because they don't like him, then we'll talk about it. But we need money. If you do this after selling Garnacho, we don't have the money to do a midfield. We don't have the money. I agree. If you move Bruno in here, you need you need a different Well, maybe maybe not. I mean, the pairing has worked. The pairing has worked. Um, to be fair, we actually won six games out of like 10. Um, so it could work. But it's not ideal. I can say that for sure. Um, with one game a week with with the current situation, we we could run it, but I don't like it. I don't think it's the right concept in terms of a pairing. Am I concerned Ugart hasn't played recently? Not really. I mean, I don't care what what happens this summer happens. I'm fine with us doing whatever in the summer, selling whoever, doing whatever. The season's over. I'm ready for whatever needs to happen. Don't I'm not attached to anybody bar probably like Lenny Yoro and Doru in heaven. I don't really care. Um, have I discussed the Embu link by Sully? Yeah, I've been talking about that. We've wanted three forwards and Bumo is on the list as well. Um, yeah. I just I don't care. It's just, yeah, we don't we don't have an answer yet. That's the unknown. This is where because we didn't get Champions League, we have to wait and see. by selling Gacho. Um, you know, by selling Gacho, by selling some other players, we could afford this, but uh, we need to play, but we can't afford to rebuild the midfield. So, I just don't see how I don't think that's the plan unless we were going to run this team out because we'd be out of money, basically. barring other significant sales that weren't that would be hard to do. If we sold Bruno, then you can add to the midfield and it would make some sense. So, I don't know. Yeah, I I really don't know. That's the question. That's our main question. So, we'll kind of wrap it up there. I'm going to do some videos this week and and we'll we'll find out because the unknowns right now, the next questions that need to be answered are one, will Liam Dilap choose United over anybody else? We don't know yet, but we should find out this week. Two, will Yokerish be willing to join United? We should find out this week if there's anything in that still. Three, will Bruno Fernandez leave? These are all unknowns as of today. They are unknowns. We don't have the answers yet, but what we know is we want three forwards. So based on those answers, it's going to determine what we do in the market after the first one to two, you know, signings because then how do we afford a midfield to add to it? Can we get a keeper out? So it's in stages, but Kuna Dunn striker will find out Dilaperish this week very likely. Um, then we'll find out on Bruno. Then we'll find out on the tens. Then we'll find out in the midfield what we can do. So, we're moving in stages, but I want them to be getting this done early. That's the most important thing to me. Get it done early. Um, get it done early. Um, that's the most important. Get the signings we need in quick. Get it wrapped so we know what we're intending to to to do. like all these questions, we can't be waiting until mid to late July to find out like we usually do. Um, obviously a 10 and a striker early would would tell us a lot. Um, but at the same time, um, we need these other questions answered very very very very early on in the window so we know where we're going. Because if if we get a 10, a striker in, and Bruno is settled, then we know we need to sell to buy other players. We know the next a number another forward is the next guy that we're buying and at least we can focus on that point and then a midfielder. So, they got to be quick. We got to get answers to this. And yeah, goalkeeper will for sure happen. Goalkeeper will for sure happen. No, I'm not sure of anything about Ugarte, but I'm not also going to make things up that people want just to uh just to make them happy. Um, a cell stream. Yes. So, what I'm going to do tomorrow is I'm going to make a video on the book of values remaining for um all the players that are potentially being sold. And then we will from there um we can I can go through and talk about where they're at, how much that might help us, what it might what gain it might give us, what we can spend with that um and everything and and that would help us a lot. Um yeah, I mean look, Bruno in the pivot I think will work in games where we expect to be against a very very deep block, but otherwise it's a it's a big risk. definitely a big risk and then uh and all of that. Um so I I'll do that. I'll make that video tomorrow. So hopefully that helps us figure out like helps understand where we're at. Um the Li article had something in the Yeah, it said he had a struggle to adjust to the speed of the Premier League. That's normal. That's probably talking about the early months and things like that as well. Um that also could just be from Tenhog. I mean, we could talk about that article briefly if you wanted, uh, about some of the things in it. Um, you know, we could we could put that we could we could talk about that for a second. Um, I don't know what what people are are reacting so heavily to it. By the way, while we're here, 1100 people here, 173 likes. Get it. Give me at least like two 300. There's a lot of you here. Just go just click the like button while you're watching. But I genuinely wasn't sure when I saw the article and I read it. I'm I'm genuinely unsure what what are people um what are people reacting to so heavily in that article that they feel is is so negative. What is it? What what's the issue? Because I didn't get it. Um, I didn't get what was the uh what was the issue. I didn't I didn't see what was like such a big deal. I mean, 90% of it we knew already. It's just like a summary of things that we've talked about in the past. I mean, one of the things that will be ignored by some people who were pushing an agenda is that it said it was Will Cox who had some concerns about how to rebuild the team of the three at the back and that it would take some time to get there. People were trying to say, ""Well, Ashworth knew."" No, all Ashworth was doing was suggesting shitty English managers, you know, nothing else. Um 150k a week on on on DAP. Yeah, we we kind of knew that that we had made that offer a little while ago. Um, but yeah, I I didn't really think there was anything in it of of note. I mean, I think people are overanalyzing some really um basic stuff and like I don't know. I mean, how how is a good manager? Sure, but he's also at Newcastle. But I don't know. Oh, that one seems suspicious given that he and Ashworth didn't get along according to their reporter. So, I don't know about that one. Um, you know, but like I don't know. Um, you know, Marco Silva, Graham Potter, like whatever. Um, but yeah, I didn't I really didn't see anything in the article that was concerning. It's like it's just it's just funny to me like what what's the big deal? It's it's a lot of normal stuff. There was there was something about Jim Ratcliffe coming in and talking to like the masseuses or whatever and asking them for uh you know to email them what they do and talking about how he stretches before. Like have you ever worked in a business? Like owners always do [ __ ] like that. It's just normal like, ""Oh, I'm working. Oh, there's the the higherup executive walks down to yap about [ __ ] to ask what people are doing, to get a finger on the pulse, to do these kinds of things."" Whether they should or they shouldn't, they all do it. Every single one of them. Like, it's that or I guess, you know, you complain about them being involved, complain about them sitting in Florida not answering phone calls when you're trying to get transfers done. Like, I don't know. Uh, Dwayne, do you think Casook stays if Bruno stays or he goes? I don't think it's relevant to each other. I think that Casemir will go if we find someone to take him. Uh yeah, the only thing new was Amaram going, but I think the thing is is that with that with that meeting for sure is that he just wanted to be involved and make sure he's on the same page. I think he wanted to be able to tell them, you know, this is what I'm going to do with the squad. Probably talked about the Garnacho situation a bit uh and a few other things. So, you know, that part is interesting. uh the the shooting, you know, I I I don't know. There there's quite a bit of um there's quite a bit of uh of narrative in there to be fair to the journalists involved because claiming that the shootout specialist helped us win shootouts. You can't prove that. You don't have any idea. I mean, we beat Arsenal in a shootout without them. I mean, it's like uh there was a few things where I was like, ""Okay, that's a little bit negative. Here we go."" Oh, there we go. Uh Kuna, here we go. He's It's done. There we go. Boom. As expected, we're through. It's over. Um there it is. Kuna done. United have here we go. verbal agreement in place between all parties. Um Kuno will sign until June 2030 with option till 2031. Wolves to receive 62.5 million clause value in installments. Formal steps contract to be checked next week. Boom. May 25th, best left 10 in the league. Joins Manchester United after a 15th place finish. We're just built different. We're just built different. It's United. That's it. It's It's It's 3:57. Um 3:57 my time on the 25th. There we go. There we go. That's what I'm talking about. You know what's crazy about this? And maybe I'll revise my thoughts later, but I genuinely think this guy is going to be the most impactful player we can sign this summer. Like I I don't know why I think that. Well, I do know why I think that because, you know, he just he's he seems like a player who's ready to just to bust. You know, I'm Oh, Lord, I'm ready to bust. You know what I mean? I might be the only account live for the Here we go. I know it's 11 p.m. in the UK. Woo! Woo! It's me. I'm live. I'm here. Come join. Hold on. I'm gonna pull up the tweet and and everything in one second here. All right. Um, all right. There we go. Boom. Amazing. Amazing stuff. Oh lord. He fa he fa he f amazing. I am so happy. I am so happy. But no, seriously, I I I think that Yeah, update the title to get viewers. Good idea. Let me Let me pop this over for a second. And then I'll have to make a video on Kuna tomorrow as well. Oh, good lord. Lots to lots to do. I'll have to make that tonight probably. See, I don't know how to do YouTube. So, like, that's a good idea. You tell me update the title and I'm like, sweet. I didn't even know I could do that. Like the video. I just updated the title to Kuna done. All of that. So, go for it. Like the video. Do all of that. Smash a like for Kuna. Um, beautiful stuff. Beautiful stuff. No, no, I I did I did as well. Let me let me hop on over to to Twitter though real quick. Here we go. I always hear it in Fabitio's voice now whenever he tweets here, you know, whenever he tweets. Like, can you guys hear it in Fabitio's voice? Here we go. In his in his uh his little Italian accent because I always can. Um Matis Ka is here we go. But yeah, look, the nice part about this release clause is we get to play it in three installments. Um, so we get to split it up a bit. That is really cool. Um, and so guys, Matias Kuna is here. We go. It is done. Inos Manchester United have presented. It starts to fade once I do like five words. Once I do like three words, it fades into a different accent and I can't keep it going. But but I can do a few. I'm not mocking him. It It's very fun to me. Jonathan Hammond, one out of done. Start of our rebuilding of our historic club. Yes, absolutely. Right after the game two, quick signings, Dwayne. There we go. I agree. I agree. Let's get the striker. It's it's it's Yes, it turns into conte. It was better. It was better. Right. The Italian is a little better. I've spent enough time around Italians being from Chicago to get it a little bit better. A little bit better. I've listened to Fitzio enough time. Um, Brazilian too, I got to tell you. Wait, quick question. Quick question. Will Matias Kuna become the best Brazilian to have ever played for Manchester United when it's all said and done? Not like considering Casemiro, we're not counting his accomplishments at at Madrid, right at United. Will Kuna become the best Brazilian to have ever played for this club? Right now, it's Fred, honestly. Maybe Casemiro. Will he? I think Couna will I know Anderson, Raphael, these are good players. I think Couna will be better. The bar is not that high. Anderson is probably first. You're right. But the bar is not that high, Fred. I think I I know he won titles, but what did what did he do? What did he do? I like Anderson and Raphael for sure, but I think that Kuna will become individually on his performances the best Brazilian that we've had. It's possible. It's possible. [ __ ] off with the Anthony [ __ ] It's possible. We were so close to Ronaldo. We were so close to Ronaldo, man. We were so close. We were so close to Ronaldo. We were so close. But look, when I look at Kuno, the reason why I think Oh, we could just It's It's like dark and stormy out here, too. So, even the light on my own computer blasts me like crazy. But the reason I think he's going to be so good is look at this, man. Look at how few touches the guy is getting in terms of receiving the ball. You give him the touches we've been giving to Garnacho and it's like he's gonna blow up, man. He's going to blow up. He's going to blow up. Which almost signing would we rewind back to? Me, it's Ronaldo because he's like one of my favorite players of all time. If we had somehow gotten Ronaldo, maybe my favorite player of all time who's not a United player is Ronaldo. So to me, that's always the big one, the almost signing. I wish we got is Ronaldo. This is such a perfect signing. Like there's so few times where I felt like you look at a team and you just go, ""Oh yeah, that's the guy. That guy fits every single thing we want to do."" Um, but that's Kuna. He fits everything. He's exactly the right player. same system, same league, all of that, then we wouldn't have signed CR7 maybe. I mean, obviously that changes the whole circumstances, but but in but regardless of consequence, I'm saying Ronaldo is my favorite player that we almost signed. Uh, Romano did a video updates on Onana and Garnacho. Both can leave. Says again, we're looking at Savage says plan. Okay. So, keeper, keeper, keeper, keeper, keeper, keeper, keeper, keeper. Couna, striker. If we get Kuna, a striker, and a keeper by July 1st, can you believe that? Imagine we have Couna, a striker, and a keeper by June. It's like the biggest problem solved. The biggest possible problem solved um in immediately like come on man Dwayne dribbler kick and run shoot a b dribbler kick and run. He's perfect. He's perfect. People are will see he's like a garnacho if he could shoot pass or create chances for others you know. Um, it's wild. It's like we've been planning for this, though. Keeper, keeper, keeper. I like Vana. I like Vana. He's big. He's tall. He's massive. He's [ __ ] huge. Um, I like Vana. Uh, Garcia. It sounds like Barcelona. I'm guessing we won't be able to compete with Barcelona. I like the idea of of of Malinkovic. He's huge. He's a shots stopper. Um, big ass shots stopper. one of the best in the in the in the world. Um, Emer has serious green flag in his eye for player. Well, fair enough. You don't like a system. But that's where I was saying, look, whether you do or you don't, I think he knows players. I really think he knows talent. I think he knows personality. I think he knows what he's doing on that front. But let's get let's get this big ass Donnarum sized goalkeeper in our net instead of a guy who's 6'2 but plays like he's 5 foot three and whose arms are, you know, shorter than Jordan Pigfers apparently. You know, let's get a big ass guy. Okay, that's that's what I want. Stops shots, claims crosses. That's all I care about. And I think that that's that's Vana. That's the the in that lame mens is obviously like a high potential young player but Vana Vana Vana for me is the one in that respect. Like if if if you would ask me what I would prefer, I I would I I would probably at the end say that Yeah, I'm freak. This is exciting. I cannot believe this is happening already. It's so early. It makes me very, very happy. We've Is this the difference between planning for a window and reacting once the the window is started? I think so. Experienced sevenfooter and goal. Give me that, too. There you go, Dwayne. I'm with you there. Vana, this is this is very exciting. I I'm definitely old-fashioned now in my goalkeeper view. Just get me someone who can save the ball. But the fact that Kuna will also be there all season. Oh my god. Did you guys hear that? Can you guys hear the thunder, the storm? I might lose power. If I do, I'll be gone. Nothing I can do about it and I apologize in that case. Um, we got a big big old storm. Um, big old storm here. Good deal. Primary target. Just realize that we already know. We already know. Yeah. It was agreed a week ago. Yeah. We already know today that that we will only we will not have to watch Alejandro Granacho run up and down that wing taking pot shots from 30 yards out next season. We're saved. We're saved. We are saved. That's very very That's very very good to me. Vanyasar, that's a good one. Van Vanyasara, nice. Okay, I like that. We are saved. Yeah, it doesn't matter. He starts July 1. I really don't care. Um, yeah, a very strong storm here in Denver. Yeah, Juan, you're here, right? I feel like I've seen your name and you've said you're here in Denver. Yeah, it's a big one. We've been getting hail. We've been getting all sorts of [ __ ] There's a lot of thunder. Um, we'll see. We'll see. um that it it probably made me the the angriest I've been this season while watching us play has probably been watching um um has probably been watching Garnacho take pot shots from from 25 yards out, you know, over and over and over again. Now we'll see Kuna doing it. That's great. But he's got an amazing long shot on him, by the way. He's an incredible long shooter. Yeah. All right, guys. Um, well, we got the Here we go on COA. I've got a bunch of videos to make tomorrow. Um, thanks for hanging out with me today. It's getting late. I got to get to everything else in my life. So, thanks for hanging out with me, guys. I appreciate you all. Um, first here we go. of the day, of the season, of the summer, the best signing so far for us and maybe the best signing we will make this year uh already in the door in Matias Kuna. Very exciting stuff. Have a good one everybody and thank you for all the donations. Thank you for all the joints. Thank you for all the memberships. Smash a like on the way out. Let's make sure we get as many as possible in here. I really appreciate you guys. Um uh we'll be back with a whole bunch of stuff this week. We got a lot to do now.",0.056,0.787,0.157,1.0
WjmXXef87Tw,7229,207,48,NEW BMW M2 CS in Brooklyn Grey - Review & Unveil,20250525,"Hey guys, welcome to Lake Oman and welcome to Villa Urba. We're here on the Saturday before the Concord on Sunday because we're going to show you something very cool. You already have seen the sister car of this one and this is the BMW M2CS in Brooklyn Gray. We shot that car actually a couple of days ago. We haven't done a YouTube video on it yet only Instagram. So, I'm here to show you once again this one. So, let's start with the design. I can't talk too much about specs. I'll mention what I can today. But there you go. front end design. As I said, it is based on the M2. The biggest differentiation, it's the Kenny grill. You can see right there, it's completely different. More air opening to cool the engine down. You have the M2CS sign, which is unique. Then on the bottom here, you can see there is no carbon fiber splitter. You're getting this, not even plastic. It's more of a rubber type of thing. Apparently, there was a little bit complicated to do this to get the carbon fiber splitter geometry right, especially because of this setup on this car compared to the M3 and M4. So, that's the reason why they haven't done it apparently. Same thing with the yellow lights. Um, a limitation apparently also on the engineering side of things and some home logations issues as well. So, this is why it doesn't get uh the yellow daytime running lights like the other CS model, which is a pity because that's such a staple thing. So that's kind of the only change at the front. If you go to the side, you will get the CS wheels. You can see the bronze color right there and the red calipers, CM brakes. Essentially the same wheels as on the other CS models. You are starting to get some carbon fiber here. So you have a mirror cap and of course you can see the roof as well right there. But from the side you will see really no change whatsoever. It's really just the M2 design. But if you go here, you will notice the ducttail. So ask for your go right there. That's the ducttail. That's probably the biggest addition to the car. And of course the M2CS badge right there with this black and red color. Very cool. The exhaust is unchanged. So same exhaust and you have this new carbon fiber diffuser which is nicely sculpted. A little bit better than you get on the regular M2. But once again, the biggest story is really the duct tail. You can see it right there. I do wish they would have changed the tail lights a little bit, but I guess maybe they'll do it in the future for other cars or maybe not. We'll we'll see. So, once again, biggest story ducttail. Absolutely beautiful. So, now if you look inside, I've talked about this in the other video as well. It starts right there. You're getting an CS badge right there. So, that's one thing. flat bottom steering wheel with a 12:00 red marker and then carbon fiber galore right there. Then of course the same CS console as in the other ones with the CS name right there also on the door seal too. One option carbon bucket seats. No other option. Beautiful black with Alcantara right there. And then of course you got the M colors all around and clearly it's got carbon fiber back right there which is nice. But as always you can see how limited space is for four people. A car for two. So this are pretty much the only changes inside. Nothing else has changed really. That's not marino leather. Some people thought it's really just the typical dashboard that you see in the M2. Nothing else. It's different. So that once again that's the interior the BMW M2 CS. Now So, I can do that. Let me pop up the hood and you can see what's hiding underneath there. You will see the bracing that we've seen on the M2 as well. Lots of braces right there to handle the stiffness of the front end of course and the power which is being communicated. 530 PS, 479 lbft of torque, 650 new m of torque as well. S58 3.0 L. So, really no change there. other fact that it's getting more power than in the regular M2. And it matches now the M3 and M4. And right there, you would expect probably to see a carbon fiber hood, but you're not. It's your typical M2 hood, but I'm going to show you the trunk one more time because that one is actually quite light. It is made of carbon fiber. So, we can close this up. I'm going to go to the back and I'll show you the dock tail one more time. So, you see, super light. I mean, honestly, you expect it to be quite heavy, but it's carbon fiber, so of course it's going to be quite light right there. You can see the carbon fiber all around. Quite quite light. And this is why they communicated about a 30 kilo weight loss compared to the M2 automatic for the European spec. It will vary in the US a little bit because the cars are configured differently. But yeah, this is kind of cool. It's integrated, you know, this duct tail into the trunk and it's quite light, so you are saving some weight there, which is awesome. All right, so this is the BMW M2CS. Once again, it's here at Villa Urba. Will be here tomorrow as well. I have a chance I had a chance to drive I had a chance to film the BMW M2 in velvet blue and I think out of the two color that I've seen so far, I'm leaning more towards the velvet blue. Even though this one, it is pretty cool. pool. I mean, it's a typical Brooklyn gray, so it looks nice under certain light conditions. And you can see right there, I mean, typical gray, but I think in a world full of grays, might as well go for that velvet blue, which I think it is fantastic. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Welcome to this very small but nice event and it feels always great to be back here at the Vesta, the Lago de Ko. It's such a great feeling. It's great to be here with you and Oliver and I decided this year to bring something special uh as a surprise. And as you can see, it's hidden underneath here. And for sure, what's hidden underneath here will also be a future classic and collector car. But before I keep on talking about something you can't see, I'd say maybe Oliver, we should already unveil it now. Let's do it now. [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Well, there it is. The all new BMW M2 CS, the second generation of a very iconic car built upon the already iconic BMW M2 series. Well, the CS models themselves, they play a very special role in our portfolio and all of them became collector cars. Now, this one actually has a lot of properties and I would like to address a few of them. Of course, outstanding agility is one of them, but also a significant increase in power output and that combined with supreme driving dynamics and also in regards to design particularly sporty design features that make this car actually the top of the lead in its segment. Now, a few figures about the car because I said increased power output. We upped the power of this 6cylinder airline engine to 530 horsepower. All on the rear with 650 Newton meters. We took out 30 kg of weight by the use of a lot of carbon fiber meaningful plastic components on the exterior but also on the interior. And it will only be a limited production run for a short period of time. So it will also be a limited production. Now [Music] At BMW M, we always are designing for the performance perspective for B aspects. But in this car, in this specially designed, our intent was to really enable this kind of pure driving experience. We increase the aerodynamic downforce. That's what you see in the front with the splitter. you really you're going to see something else. Um below the weight, we mentioned it already. And uh last but not least, we try to um reduce let's say the the thickness of every element in the air intakes outside as well as in the kidney. And you see for instance this air intake is so thin that we had this kind of crossbar in order to to let it be um let it stay stable. Coming to that side, I think I really like as well this kind of protein ray with the smart clothes. Carbon fiber is one of the key elements for lightweight. So, mirror caps for carbon fiber entire carbon fiber as well as um the deck for the trunk. And maybe that's I'd say from my perspective one of the most impulsive perspective to see a really high D So this carp stands for something else something and we did the same in interior. So again performance reasons that's all. So if you enter the car first of all you see this kind of door with a specific CS logo in it carbon fiber seats covered fiber center console and um something that you might be able to see from now there's this little Easter egg in the doors. So this night you're going to see this kind of this uh local shine by so everything really made on point. Um an amazing car. I would love to have one. We we still need to discuss it. Um but I think Yeah. Well, that's from my perspective. It's not what you say. Yeah. I think you said everything and in racing there's this one question and it is is your car a fast car? And the answer in racing always is if it looks fast, it is fast. And you are responsible for making it look fast. So thank you very much for that. And now thank you to everyone here. Just come around and have a look at the car. I think uh yeah, it's party time. Thank you very much. [Applause]",0.019,0.848,0.134,0.9997
pHBowUMqnn8,4228,373,39,"New Hero ""J"" Review | Guardian Tales",20250525,"What's up, guys? Welcome back to... Hero Review In today's video, we're going to review J Yes, her name is just...... J  She is a water element hero. She has normal attack and skill damage party buff. she's a ranged hero. But... Is she good in Colloseum, Arena, Guild Raid, etc.? Well, let's find out Agent J's Kit Her normal attack is shooting an arrow at your enemy Her skill action, Ripple Step, lets her dash to a nearby location doesn't sound special, huh? But wait until you unlock her special ability Her special ability makes her normal attack increase her defense by 30% on hit. Her ripple step also boosts her attack by 30% And when her HP drops below 35%, she gains a shield equal to 40% of her HP Pretty cool, right? What? You're not satisfied yet? Then wait until you get her exclusive weapon. When she equips her exclusive weapon, her ripple step boosts normal attack damage by 25% and movement speed by 20% for 7 seconds. Even better, the ripple steps cooldown is only 5 seconds, so she can keep the boost up constantly. If there's a map race, I'm very sure she'll be the winner. What the fu You're still not satisfied? Then wait until you evolve her and her weapon to 6 star, she will deal even more damage due to massively increased stats. Let me guess. Still not satisfied? Yeah I want  something like Plague Doctor an all content hero Get the hell out of here, greedy player! Anyway, let's get back to her kit. Her weapon skill, Sonic Wave, deals AOE damage to enemies in front of her. Her chain skill, Dolphin Dive, summons three dolphins to deal range damage to enemies in the attack area. As we can see from her kit, I think she'll be a good damage dealer. But unfortunately, she lacks a def reduction debuff or any damage increasing buff. Can she still be used in guild raid? Let's test her out. This is the current best water range team, and this is the new team I want to test. This is my build. Alright, let's start the testing. first, the current best team. Then, the new team. During the new water team test, the boss kept targeting J, so the results are kind of invalid. But don't worry, I found a run where the boss targets me instead. Here's the total damage. As we can see from the results, the current best team still deals more damage than the new one And even when it does deal more, the difference is tiny and hard to get. So yeah she's not really worth building if you're focused on this content I wanted to try a team with J as leader, but I realized that would skew the test and lead to the wrong conclusion In conclusion, she is good in this content just because she's a 6 star hero She lacks def reduction debuff and attack increasing buff Well, she has attack increasing buff in her leader skill, but it only lasts for 15 seconds Speaking of her leader skill, I haven't covered it in her kit yet, have I? It shoots multiple arrows at the enemies and deals AOE damage That's so cool! Alright, next content, Colosseum. Before we test her in Colosseum, let's see how she performs in the battle first. One, she's a single target hero. Her arrows only hit one enemy. Two, her weapon skill deals AOE damage, but I think the damage isn't hurt enough The cooldown is pretty slow and you need to land it twice to get chain skill. And three, she doesn't provide any buff or debuff Hmm, seems like she's not a good hero here either. Anyway, let's start the testing First, I'll test her as the leader. Why can't she stay still, bro? What the heck was that damage? So weak yeaah I don't think it's gonna work well. Let's test her as a team member. Oh my God, what is she doing? Don't jump into enemy territory, you're not a tank. Damn, she really likes running around Even when it'll kill her. Okay, I guess we're ready to make a conclusion.  in conclusion One, she is not a good leader in Colosseum. Two, she is not that good either as a party member LOL. Always running around here and there, like a silly child But I must say her party buff is useful So I'll leave room for doubt maybe the team I'm using just isn't right for her If you've had good results with her in Colosseum, drop a comment below. Last content, arena and death match I'm just gonna say it right now. Yes, she is good in both content It's basically the rule of thumb for Guardian Tails heroes They must be good in one of these content If they're not good in Colosseum and Guild Raid, that means they'll be good in Arena or Deathmatch To prove my point, here are some clips of me playing with her. Very cool, right? She is so good that she carried me from Gold to Top 3 in Deathmatch. Next, I'll show you my arena clip. Wow. Damn. Holy cow, she is so OP from what we saw in those clips, I think we can conclude that one, she is meta in arena and death match Her strength lies in her speed and her painful, very painful, normal attack. How to use her? Well, it's actually very simple Just keep your distance and keep attacking your opponent Don't forget to boost her speed with Ripple Step One more trick. Right after Ripple Step, hit Dash to shift even farther and stay safe from your opponent's attacks It also allows you to attack immediately. This is my J-Build And this is the comp I use. J relies on normal attack, so I think it's better to go with full damage comp. being said, I think we know who benefit the most from summoning her. With that Yes, it's player who focus on arena and death match And that's it from my J review As always, if you guys have a question or different opinion, feel free to comment below Thank you guys for watching. See you in the next video.",0.183,0.631,0.186,-0.9417
J9uEXb5TzBE,2554,231,45,Little Debbie Nutty Buddy Cakes & Entenmann’s Tropical Pineapple Little Bites Review,20250525,"Today, Kevin and I have some new snack cakes to try for you. We have the Little Debbie Nutty Buddy cakes, and mine are the tropical pineapple little bites mini muffins. So, the these were both bought at Kroger. The Little Debbie Nutty Buddy Cakes. This is a big pack. This is 360 g. So, for 360 g it was 5.49. 49. So Kevin's, how many grams is yours? Um 234 for 234 g. It was 579. So 5.49. 579. You're getting the better deal with these, but we'll see which one tastes the best. Uh so we're going to be trying the Nutty Buddy cakes first. I like the little dog on there, though. He's got the little hat on with the tropical pineapple on top. And you can see him. D. Yeah. Okay. So, this you get 10 cakes individually wrapped. Nutty buddy cakes. Twinkies. That's exactly what I was going to say. No, they you know. Oh, they're so small. Yeah. On the package that makes it look really big. I thought we were getting something big. No, it's the size of a Twinkie. It's literally I think it's smaller than a Twinkie. It might I don't know. That's a tiny little tiny thing. Twinkies are smaller than you think they are. I thought we were getting something big. Well, from the from the appearance of the look, when you don't have anything to like u compare it to, like they didn't stick anything on the front of the package to to judge the size by like somebody holding it. It makes it look like it's really big. And even when people are holding stuff, they hold it in their hand for pictures. Yeah. Look. Yeah. To make it way back here. Make it look really big. Yeah. Okay. So, these are um 170 calories for one cake. And what is there no description at all? I don't think there's there's literally no description whatsoever. My description is going to be Oh gosh, let me try it. A white cake with a peanut butter filling and a chocolate coating. That's it. It's not Twinky like at all. It's It's more cupcake texture like a cup like a cupcake or a It's just cake. I don't hate it. I don't know if I'll love it either. I don't hate. I feel the same. They're like, ""Yeah, I'd rather eat just a regular old nutty bite."" The bars. Oh, I mean, I don't know why you would choose these over the bars. The crunchy like wafer bars. I don't either. This This is the second attempt. Actually, the third attempt by Little Debbie if you count the ice cream. Hudsonville ice cream. Yep. This is like the third way that I know of where they've tried to reinvent the Nutty Buddy. Um, and really had something inspired by, right? Does this say it doesn't? These are nutty buddy cakes. Um, I I think you should stick with the original Nutty Buddies. If you like those, those are they're they're hard to beat. Yeah. If you like those, you're not going to go, ""Oh, let's try this and switch over."" Cuz this is not going to Well, you might try these. You probably will try these if you switch. But you're not going to be happy with it. Yeah. Um they do have there is a peanut butter flavor. Um it's really light though. It's just, you know, I would I've we've had dipped Twinkies before and I think dipped Twinkies are the best Twinkies when they dunk those in something. Uh, they're better. And I think I would rather have a chocolate dipped Twinkie than have this. Um, this is not the same texture as a Twinkie, though. Twinkies have a little bit of a chew to them and they're more dense. These are these are literally cake. Mhm. And the chocolate's that traditional regular chocolate coating you get in any of these snack cakes. Like I said, I don't hate it. I just don't love it. It's just It's just kind of in the middle. It's just kind of It's It's not bad. It has a little salt. There's some salt there. You do get the peanut flavor. You get a little bit of the chocolate. You do get a nice coating on the outside. Um it's not that it tastes bad. Um if I don't know, there's just so many other Little Debbie cakes I would rather have. If I want a peanut butter snack cake, then I'm going to go for the Little Debbie the big peanut butter sandwiches. Yeah, those are really good. Or at least they were the last time we had them. Oh, yeah. They were. Yeah, they were good. I'd go for a Nutty Buddy. That's literally the de facto standard peanut butter like snack. Yeah, that is the best. If Yeah, if I'm wanting Nutty Buddy and they had those other ones there right next to these, the other ones that we tried, which I was like, no way I would ever buy those again, I would pick these over those. The round ones. I would pick these over those. But ultimately, I'm just going to buy the original. Yeah. if if I'm in the mood for that. I think these are if you're looking for that nutty buddy flavor in a snack cake, this is going to miss the marker. I guess these are for the people who don't like wafer. I've heard from people who say, ""I don't like wafer."" And I'm like, ""Oh, wow. Okay."" But I mean, there's people who don't like everything, so that makes sense. I just never heard that before. Yeah. If you didn't like the wafers, this is their alternative, but it's not a good alternative. But this is better than the other ones. These are better than the round ones. So if you if you don't like the wafer, maybe you'll like these. No, get the other like you said, the Little Debbie peanut butter. I'd say if you want peanut butter, get the sandwiches. That's what I'm saying. Okay, so now these are going to be interesting. Intimmen's Little Bites. New tropical limited edition tropical pineapple muffins made with real pineapple. No artificial colors. No high fructose corn syrup. All right. So, are the intimins just in case you didn't know? Intimins. Yes. Intimins. Intimins. Intimins. Okay. One pouch is 200 calories. The whole box is 999. 990 calories. Hey, our grandson could have eaten the whole box. The whole box. I think he has before. I think he has too. Cuz you buy them, you're like, ""Well, there goes that box."" Mhm. Yeah. Uh, Bimbo Bakeries in Pennsylvania. They smell good. They smell like pineapple. They taste like pineapple. Yeah. Not bad pineapple flavor. I wonder how many kids will like that. I don't know. They're sweet. Mhm. They are. It honestly it um it would remind you of the pineapple upside down cake without all the um the goo sticky and Yeah, it reminds you of the base cake. Pineapple upside down cake. Just the base cake with the pineapple. Plenty sweet. Uh I actually like those. I do too. They're very fresh. They have a good pineapple flavor. They don't have any weird flavors or textures or anything like that going on. It's It's so easy to eat. Um, so if your kid likes that and you could even if you wanted to be bad, you could even take those and dip them into some whipped cream. That would be really good. Some cold whipped cool whip is what I made. Cool whip. Some cold cool whip with that. Dip it in there and pop it your pop the whole thing in your mouth. That's actually really good. Um, so I like these. Yeah, I would pick these. I would pick the intims over the little dubby. Yeah, the little bites are much better. Mhm. Yeah. for this for this particular flavor. I really like these. Uh so not so much the little I mean the they're fine. They're just kind of like okay, you made them, but I don't know. We'll see how long they stay around cuz they're not bad. They're just okay. There's nothing spectacular about them. Yeah. I don't know how much going to be repurchased. If the peanut butter had been a better peanut butter, then I might have been better. Yeah. I would have been like, ""Oh, those were worth making."" But as it is, it's just okay peanut butter. So, it's like, h whatever. You know, I can take it or leave it. So, I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching. [Music]",0.036,0.755,0.209,0.9998
Q_13tOzuXt8,1575,69,11,iPhone 16 Pro Still Worth the Hype? (8-Month Long-Term Review),20250525,"Hey everyone, what's up? Welcome back to the channel. So, it's been like eight whole months since the iPhone 16 Prodrived back in September 2024. And, you know, I've been using this thing as my daily driver ever since. We're talking calls, endless gaming, snapping tons of photos, tethering to my Mac, pretty much everything. You know, Apple's been at this since like 2007 with that original little 3.5 in iPhone. Each year they tweak it, they refine it, but that core idea uh a super premium pocketable gadget where the the hardware and software just like click that's still there. And this iPhone 16 Pro, well, it definitely follows that path. It's got a bigger 6.3 in screen this time, which is actually a first for the Pro models not being a Max uh and a bunch of new hardware. So, today I'm going to give you the lowdown, my honest thoughts after living with this most advanced iPhone ever for a good chunk of a year. Is it all hype or is it actually worth your cash in 2025? Let's get started. All right, so first up, the design and feel. You know, it's got those familiar pro iPhone vibes. Flat edges, a shiny side button, matte glass back, but the big new thing, well, it's this grade 5 titanium frame. Apple says it's incredibly strong and impressively light. And honestly, holding it, it does feel super sturdy. It's got this new textured titanium that I mean just feels more premium than last year's iPhone 15 Pro. I've got the desert titanium finish here, which is this cool new earthy bronze color. It looks pretty slick and doesn't get all fingerprinty, which is a plus. Now, it's around 199 g. So, yeah, it's it's got some heft. Definitely heavier than those super slim aluminum phones, but and this is the kicker, thanks to that titanium, it's actually lighter than the stainless steel 14 Pro. Even though the 16 Pro is a bit bigger, I usually only notice the weight if I'm like holding it up for ages. But for normal calls or one-handed scrolling, it's comfy enough. The seams are tight. It doesn't scratch easily, and the flat edges actually give a pretty good grip. Oh, and they kept the action button from the 15 Pro, which is cool. But what's really new is this camera control button on the lower right. Took me about a week to get the hang of it. But now, seriously, uh, a quick tap or hold opens the camera. Um, and you can drag your finger on it to adjust zoom or exposure. It's quicker than fumbling through menus for sure. And the display borders, they're even thinner. Apple's got this new tech that makes the black bezels almost like disappear into the frame. You really notice it next to an older model. The screen just seems to pop more. Ergonomically, it is larger than the 15 Pro. I can mostly reach the screen one-handed, but uh not quite the very top without a little shimmy. And yeah, it's a bit tall and wide, so stashing it in a slim pocket is a little trickier. It's not like uncomfortably huge, but it's definitely a larger device. Okay, let's talk about this screen. The 16 Pro has a new 6.3 in Super Retina XDR OLED panel. That's a slight bump up from the 6.1 in on the 15 Pro. In practice, it's like a tenth of an inch wider and taller, but you actually notice more content. My home screen icons, some apps even show an extra row. Watching Netflix or YouTube, way more immersive for me. 6.3 in is kind of the sweet spot. Big enough for easy reading in media, but I can still, you know, manage it one-handed if I need to. Brightness and color are classic Apple OLED. vivid inky blacks and HDR content looks amazing. Apple rates it at 1,000 nits typical up to 2,000 nits outdoors. Performance-wise, we've got Apple's A18 Pro chip. Apple claims it's about 15% faster on the CPU and 20% on the GPU than the A17 Pro. And honestly, this phone feels insanely fast. Apps launch instantly. Scrolling is smooth. Multitasking with a dozen apps open. No sweat. Gaming is where it really flexes. AAA titles run at full detail, no problem. Now, let's talk thermals because that's a big deal. So, Apple actually put in a new thermal system in the 16 Pro, like a better aluminum heat substructure and some glass tweaks. And Apple says this gives it up to 20% better sustained performance than the 15 Pro, which basically means it prevents overheating, much better than last year's model. In my experience, thermals are pretty well controlled. It can get a bit warm during, you know, really heavy 3D games or if I'm rendering 4K video for a while. Uh, but it hasn't like throttled badly on me or gotten uncomfortably hot. It just settles at a warm temperature. So, that improved thermal system definitely seems to be doing its job. Then there's Apple intelligence, their ondevice AI stuff. Photo searching, speech recognition, those new generative features, they all run smoothly. Siri actually feels snappier and it can even tap into chat GPT for some answers if you enable it. Speaking of Siri, it's gotten better with iOS 18. It can remember context between questions now, which is pretty neat. Like I can ask to see photos from Paris, then say also include my dog, and it gets it. That said, some of the really advanced AI stuff is still ongoing uh by Apple. So, you know, don't expect the full AI revolution today. And yes, USBC 3.0 is here. Thank goodness. Transferring big video files is way faster. You can even connect an external SSD and record video directly to it, which is a huge deal for filmmakers. All right, the cameras. This is always a big one for iPhones. The 16 Pro has a triple lens setup, a 48 megapixel main, a first 48 megapixel ultrawide on an iPhone, and get this, for the first time on the smaller Pro model, a 12 megapixel 5x telephoto lens. That periscope lens used to be only on the Pro Max. Video is, as usual, a powerhouse. But here's a really cool new thing. It can record 4K at 120 fps, so you can get some seriously smooth slow motion footage. like really at 4K resolution, which is pretty awesome. And if you're shooting in ProRes, you can even record that 4K 120 fps directly to an external SSD. Plus, you've still got that super steady action mode. And they even added audio mix, which uses multiple mics to isolate voices and reduce wind noise. And it actually works. Plus, with that new camera control button, which I've set to zoom, it's just easier to quickly switch lenses and adjust things. Battery life. The iPhone 16 Pro has a 3582 millia hour battery, which is about 9% larger than the 15 Pros. And let me tell you, it's noticeably longerlasting. On a typical day for me, streaming music, web browse, social media, some calls, photos, light gaming, and an hour of video, I'm usually ending the day with like 30 to 40% left. That's easily a full 18 to 20 hours. Tom's Guide even found it lasted about 3 hours longer in their web surfing test compared to the 15 Pro. Charging is via USBC and it's fast with a 20 watt adapter about 50% in 30 minutes. But the new thing is 25 watt MagSafe wireless charging. If you get Apple's new 30 watt adapter and cable, that's a nice jump from 15 watt. I tested it and it's definitely faster, though it does make the phone and puck a bit warm. Still very convenient for topping up. So after eight months, this phone just feels like a mature, refined machine. iOS 18 is snappy. Face ID is fast. Dynamic Island is useful for notifications and live activities without being too obtrusive on this larger screen. Ecosystem stuff with my MacBook and Apple Watch is flawless. And yeah, I appreciate having USBC for everything now. It's all e now. No physical SIM tray, which was painless for me to set up, but something to be aware of if you travel a lot with foreign SIMs. But it's not perfect. Downsides, well, the size and weight. At nearly 200 g, it's a solid block. Some days I do wish it were a bit lighter or smaller, especially for one-handed use if you have smaller hands. As I said, camera gains are great, but incremental if you have a 15 Pro. And, you know, some of those hyped AI features are still on the way. Oh, and it's pricey, starting at $999. Plus, no power adapter in the box. still. So, the big question, who should buy the iPhone 16 Pro in 2025? Well, if you're coming from an iPhone 13 Pro or older, I think it's a huge step up. Performance, battery, those new camera features, the action and camera control buttons, it'll feel like a whole new world. And if you're deep in the Apple ecosystem, you'll love it. For power users, gamers, photographers, it's a top contender. Now, if you have an iPhone 15 Pro, honestly, the upgrades might not feel urgent. The 15 Pro is still a fantastic phone. Unless you really need that 5x telephoto or the extra battery life, you could probably wait. Budget conscious folks, well, there are Android flagships that offer similar capabilities for less. Though, you're then choosing Android over iOS. Anyway, that's my take on the iPhone 16 Pro after 8 months. What do you guys think? Are you planning on getting one or are you holding out? Let me know down in the comments if you found this helpful. A thumbs up would be awesome. And uh hey, consider subscribing for more tech reviews.

Vnne5IFLxoc,7582,722,173,Ford Ranger (2.7L EcoBoost) Full Review - This Engine Changes EVERYTHING,20250525,"What is the biggest selling factor for me at least when it comes to this Ford Ranger? And it is what's underneath the hood here, the 2.7 L EcoBoost. Welcome back. I'm Alex. Today we have this Ford Ranger blessing our presence here in the shop. Last week we had the Ford Ranger Raptor, and we certainly had some fun with that. But I think the average buyer is more interested in just the standard Ranger and what it has to offer. So today, we're going to talk about some history, some specs, the biggest selling factor in my opinion about this Ranger, as well as some downsides or some things that I don't like. Well, here she is out in the daylight. Not a bad looking truck. The front end though, I don't know. It's It's very mundane is a good way to put it. Very ble. I think the GM and the uh Chevy midsize trucks look a little bit better in terms of styling on the front end. It's an XLT there, folks. We also have the FX4 package. Interesting. They put a step here because, well, these midsize trucks, they are getting a little bit taller. And uh I mean, I guess I'm not that tall myself, but I still can't actually reach the bottom of the bed. So, we got a nice step in case you got to get in there. Ranger stamped into the back. Now, we will 100% be towing with this truck. We ran this on my towing loop. We also did a fuel economy test, but this Ranger is in the Toyota Tacoma world because that is by far the best selling midsize truck, and it's not even close. So, is this new fifth gen Ranger going to compete? Well, let's find out. Fellas, almost 85% of you guys watching are not subscribed to the channel? It's all good. I get it. But if you like stuff like this, please consider subscribing. Also, I do have an Instagram and a Tik Tok page in the description if you find folks are interested. The Ford Ranger was introduced to compete with the new Chevy S10. And in 1983, the first Ford Ranger rolled off the factory line in Lewisville, and it came with a very discreet 2 L 4 cylinder engine pumping out 73 horsepower and 107 pound feet of torque at 2400 RPM. that low-end grunt that we all love in a pickup truck. Now, for those buyers that were looking for a little more oomph, there was a 2.3 L engine option with 80 horsepower and 116 pound- feet of torque. Now, jokes aside, fellas, that truck weighed in at only 2500 lb. And when strapped to an optional four-speed manual transmission, it got some serious fuel economy. The EPA rated that truck in the city at 26 to 28 m per gallon. And that puts this modern foreign Ranger to absolute shame. The Ranger in North America ran from 1983 to 2011, going through three different generations and multiple different facelifts along the way. And the idea of the Ford Ranger never really changed. It was a little truck that did little truck stuff. Sadly, on December 22nd, 2011, the last Ford Ranger rolled off the factory line, and Ford cancelled production of the Ranger, citing lack of interest and lack of sales in the platform. And things went dark for some time until 2019 when Ford brought back the beloved Ranger as the fourth gen Ford Ranger. And no longer considered a compact truck. Rather, it was a midsize truck with updated styling, higher ride height, and increased power and performance. Finally, in 2024, Ford introduced the fifth gen Ford Ranger. This baby sitting right here with us today. And boy oh boy, is she different than the first gen Ranger. She weighs about twice as much and boasts about four times as much horsepower as well as towing capability. Under the hood here, we have the newly introduced larger 2.7 L twinturbocharged V6 EcoBoost engine putting out 315 horsepower and 400 pound feet of torque. And we'll talk more about that in just a little bit. Now, you can still get the smaller 4-cylinder 2.3 L EcoBoost. And that will set you back a couple of horsepower, 270, as well as 310 lb feet of torque. Behind our 2.7 liter EcoBoost, we have a segment leading 10-speed transmission, the 10R60. And in terms of gearing, Ford's made it very easy. The only gearing option you can get with any Ford Ranger is 373 gears, which I find interesting. Typically, I think of 373 gears as a perfect happy medium on a heavyduty truck in terms of towing performance as well as some fuel economy performance, but this is a midsize truck and typically not bought with the intention of towing heavy. So, it is an interesting choice by Ford to have a rather aggressive gearing option. I would have thought they would have given these trucks a 331 gear option, maybe had an optional 373 with like a max tow package or something like that. And as we'll see on our towing loop, 373 gears certainly helps this truck pull a load. But on our fuel economy loop, the 373 is most likely negatively impacted our results. This is the FX4 off-road package, so we do get a electronic locking rear differential. You guys can see that plug going into it right there. And that is a a nice touch on this rear diff. In terms of towing capacity, Ford has once again made it pretty easy with these Rangers. Every Ranger gets a max towing capacity of 7,500 lb. Doesn't matter the engine, doesn't matter if it's a two wheel drive, four-wheel drive. As long as you get the truck with the tow package, you get a max tow rating of 7,500 lb. If you do not get the tow package, you do not receive this CL class 4 receiver hitch. And uh well, without this, I don't know what you're going to be towing. In terms of payload, this Ranger, when equipped properly, has a max payload of 1,800 lb. This Ford Ranger we have with us today, it's a 4x4 with the larger 2.7 L EcoBoost engine. Has a max payload of just over 1500 lb, which by the way is more payload than what my 2017 Ram 1500 with the 57 Hemi had in it. So, if you can fit it back here, she can take quite a bit of weight. Fuel economy, you might ask, well, it's pretty decent with the 2.3 L EcoBoost. You get a combined city and highway rating of 22 mp gallon with the larger 2.7 L V6. Like I mentioned, we have in this truck, it falls to 20 m per gallon city and highway. Now, we will be testing that out out on my fuel economy loop in the real world to see what we can actually get with this Ford Ranger. All right, let's get down to where the rubber meets the road. What is the biggest selling factor for me at least when it comes to this Ford Ranger, and it is what's underneath the hood here, the 2.7 L EcoBoost. For a gas turbocharged engine, I feel like this is the best of the bunch. And now, I've done a full engine breakdown of this 2.7 L, and I'll put a link up there down in the description. You guys can check it out if you want. But this is not your typical EcoBoost engine. And in terms of the midsize truck segment specifically, I think this 2.7 L EcoBoost is the most well-rounded engine. The 2.7 L Turbo Max in the GM midsize trucks, the Colorado and the Canyon, I think, is also a pretty darn good engine. But that does come with active fuel management, a cylinder deactivation technology, which just not really that big of a fan of. This engine has no cylinder deactivation technology whatsoever. Looking directly at the main competition, the Toyota Tacoma, and those trucks now come with the I Force 4-cylinder turbo engine. And you can get a hybrid engine option which uses the same 4-cylinder turbo engine and has a hybrid motor between the engine and the transmission giving it a lot of power more than this engine. 326 horsepower, 465 lb feet of torque out of that hybrid engine. So certainly on paper really catches your eye with those big figures. But we have to remember those engines came out in 2024. There's less than 2 years of realworld experience on those engines where this 2.7 L EcoBoost, yes, not as powerful, but it debuted in 2015, giving Ford 10 years of realworld experience and having the ability to iron out some of the issues. This is a second generation, so you know what you're going to get with a 2.7 L EcoBoost, even though it may not have those big power figures. A great example of why real world experience matters on engines is the 3 L Eco Diesel in the Ram 1500s. That engine made its debut in 2014. And in 2015, Motor Tren ranked it as its top full-size engine option. And well, we later went on to know that the 3 L Eco Diesel was a disaster of an engine. So, my point is is that it's just too early to know if that Toyota I Force engine is any good or not. And I'm not saying it's going to be as bad as the EcoDiesel. It could be great or it could be not so great. We just don't know where this engine here 10 years of real world experience. We know exactly what we're getting with this engine for the most part. Finally, is the 3.4 L naturally aspirated V6 in the Nissan Frontiers. And I think this is also a really good engine option for someone who's not necessarily looking for all the power in the world. Someone who knows they're not really going to be using the truck to tow or haul anything that heavy. But in terms of reliability, you could 100% make the argument that it could be more reliable just due to the fact that it is a simpler engine. It's a naturally aspirated unit and therefore nowhere near as complex as this twin turbocharged V6. Now, this 2.7 L EcoBoost engine is not perfect. No engine is. And there's a couple things that I don't really like about it. First and foremost is the rubber oil pump belt. And typically, or traditionally, we would see an oil pump chain. And well, this engine uses a wet oil pump belt. And the problem is is that if that fails, there's no longer going to be oil going up into your engine, and that's not really good. With that being said, this second generation of EcoBoost engine has been out since 2018. So that's 7 years of real world experience, and we haven't really seen oil pump belts letting go left, right, and center seem to be somewhat reliable up to this point. So, it's not something that I personally would lose too much sleep over. Another common complaint with this engine is the fact that it has a plastic oil pan and it often leaks. Now, Ford has tried to address this problem. I believe they updated both the oil pan as well as the oil pan gasket. And the problem with plastic oil pans, which come on a lot of engines, is as they go through heat cycles, the plastic is more likely to slightly warp and then you're going to get that that dripping or that leaking of that oil pan. Not catastrophic. whatsoever, but just a little bit annoying. Lastly, and we've touched on this a little bit, is just the complexity of this engine. It's a twin turbo V6. You can see we got a snail sitting right there. There's just going to be more failure points on this engine than something like a naturally V6 in the Nissan Frontiers. One thing I would have wished to have seen out of this Ford Ranger is more gearing options. I really like the 373s that come standard on every Ranger. It's probably what I would outfit my truck with, but I think a lot of people aren't looking to tow or haul heavy things with their Ford Ranger and 331s could lend to some better in town fuel economy, which I think a lot of people are going to be buying these trucks who live in town. The last thing I want to touch on before I let you guys get out of here is sales figures, cuz both the GM midsize trucks and the Tacoma vastly out sell this Ford Ranger. We're on TFL's page here. They got some great information on these sales figures. We're going to focus on the 2024 year. As we can see, the Tacoma leading the charge, almost 200,000 sales. GM right behind it, just under 140. And the Ford Ranger falls under 50,000 sales, which doesn't seem like that good. But there is a disadvantage that this Ford Ranger faces, and it is right here, baby. The Ford Maverick. And we can see for 2024 over 130,000 sales of this small compact truck, if you will. So, the Ford Ranger is not only competing with competition like the Tacoma, it's also competing with the Maverick. Now, if you add up both of these sales figures, you get about 177,000 trucks sold, which is far greater than GM and puts you pretty darn close to the Tacoma. So, I would guess a lot of buyers are either stepping up to the full-size F-150 for more capability or some buyers are stepping down to the Ford Maverick, realizing they don't need the full capability of something like a Ford Ranger. So, just keep all that in mind. Well, that's a quick and dirty dive into this fifth gen 2024 Ford Ranger. Let me know what you guys think about it. Look forward to our towing review. This thing did pretty well. We'll also be doing a fuel economy loop. But if you did like the video, don't forget to leave that thumbs up. And if you like cool stuff like this, don't forget to subscribe. We'd love to have you on board. Anyways, enough of me. We'll see you in the next freaking",0.04,0.823,0.137,0.9998
3g1F2v64b1U,2144,115,46,Renfail's Initial Review of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon,20250525,"What is up everybody? Renfell here and we just crossed the 20 hours played threshold with Tainted Grail, The Fall of Avalon, which means it's time to do my initial review. If you're not familiar with my process, I do a multi-step review uh system. We do an early thoughts video after our first stream session, which we've already done. Links are down below. I then do an initial review after 20 to 25 hours played, and then I do a final thoughts video, a final review when I finish the game. And usually with bigger games where I get at least 50 hours of gameplay out of them, around 50 hours, I'll do another thoughts video. So, this is the second of those multiple reviews that I do for the games that I play. And I already did an additional video yesterday, which was this is one of the best single player like firsterson RPGs that I've ever played. And yes, you could do third person. I don't care. I don't play in third person. The game was designed as a first as a first person RPG. And you can use third person, but it's actually not even like recommended. It's still kind of sort of being worked on. So, this is a phenomenal deep RPG. If you've ever played single player RPGs before in the past, whether it's, you know, the easy example here to be would be like Skyrim or Oblivion or Morrow Wind, those would be easy examples to make, but there are many, many firsterson RPGs that you could choose from. Avoued is another great example of a modern single player first-person RPG. Even though you can play in third person, I like to play in first person. Anyway, I should probably remove the first person modifier, but it is what it is. That's how I do my review process. So, let me shrink my head down here so we can actually look at some more stuff from the game. So, it has a very rich and deep um go over the character panel here. Uh everything here is like you would expect from a deep RPG. You've got your attributes which contribute to all of these different things over here. You can choose where you put your points. You have a skill tree which we've talked about in the early thoughts video. It's based upon stats. Each stat has its own unique um series of skill trees. Um I have gone heavy into bow and stealth. Um so I'm a stealth archer with this character and I'll do a build guide later on for my character. Um, it has a very robust, um, gear system. Um, I have an assassin set of gear, which gives me a, I believe, 30% bonus to my, um, stealth attacks, my, uh, sneak attacks. Um, I have a really badass bow. Um, I've got different types of arrows like wood arrows, copper arrows, iron arrows, fire arrows, ice arrows, poison arrows. You can apply magic to your weapons and armor. You can do lots of different things. There's a robust crafting system in the game for cooking food. Somebody said it's like a lot like the food in the Witcher 3. And I was like, you're not wrong. It actually is a lot like the Witcher 3 food system. Um, and then there's a potion system. You can apply codings to your weapons. You can make bombs that you can throw at NPCs. There's lots of different crafting things that you can do at the alchemy tables. And then you can craft all of your own gear. And there's different types of gear sets. You can make heavy armor, light armor, medium armor. So, it is a very robust RPG in that regard. It is a massive map. Um, we just, uh, the first map, um, which was Orange of the South. I did not clear the map 100%. Um, and there were a couple of quests that I left on the table, and I definitely did not do all of the dungeons. Um, but I spent a little over 20 hours on this map. I could probably easily get 25 to 30 hours out of just that map alone, but I'm ready to move on to the next area, which we got to at the beginning of this stream. And you can see here, um, this map is massive. Um, this is the second region. I don't know how many regions there are in the game, but this map is also massive, and I anticipate that I'm going to spend another 20 hours or so just on this map, and I don't know where it leads, so I don't know where we go from here. The voiceovers for the game are very good. Um, I recognize a lot of the voice actors from other uh smaller projects. Um, overall, uh, I would say the voice acting is exceptional. Um, the writing is pretty good. Um, there are lots of different NPCs. Um, lots of different quests. There's some humor buried in here beyond the main quests. And then there's the main story itself, which I I don't want to spoil, but I will say it's a very interesting take on the Arththeran legends. Uh, where Yeah, I don't want to spoil it beyond that. It's just a very interesting take on the Arththeran legends and how you play into this. the the spoiler is in the title of the game, The Fall of Avalon. That once you understand what's going with the story, that titling makes a ton of sense for what's going on with the story. But they do a lot of really interesting things here with um King Arthur and Merlin and the for is the forebears like the the ancients who came before. Um there's a lot of mythology here. There is a massively robust magic system that I am not tapping into at all, but other people are. Like we shared today, Slander Gaming has a really good like all the where you can find all the spells in Act One. Um, a list of like all those spells and a really cool guide that you can go watch for the people who are into spell casting. It's a very unique magic system. It's it's there's a lot going on it. I have gotten some really cool spells, even though I'll never use them, like the the red herring or the the special herring and cheese quest where you get the ability to turn people into cheese with magic. That was kind of a cool and quirky little thing. Um, but since I stick mostly to bows and daggers, that's where I've spent my focus. So, I am kind of a non-magicalbased character, even though I can apply poison and I've got some fire arrows equipped right now. Um, the music in the game is absolutely phenomenal. The sound effects are absolutely phenomenal. Um, here's where I will talk about some of the I don't want to, you know, these are just things that I think you should be aware of because for some people these are things that are a detriment. So, I always tell people that if you are not a content creator, you have no reason to be playing games on day one if you are the type of player who is going to complain about day one issues with games. So, um, this is the first game for this studio, the first of this type of game. So, like with many indie games that come out when they first launch, there are some rough around the edges aspects. If you never played Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 when it launched, but you praise how amazing Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is, and how it's this perfect RPG, but you never actually played the first game when it first came out of Kickstarter, and you kind of that's that's kind of the discussion we're having here. game companies when they launch their first game. There are going to be things that have to be worked out. There are definitely some things that are rough around the edges with this game. Quick commercial break, everyone to celebrate and give thanks to all these amazing people who keep me on the air full time. Really appreciate the support. All you got to do is join as a member. You get access to private videos. You can also do super thanks on any upload or super chats and stickers on any live stream or premiere you see. And beyond that, don't forget we're multireaming over on Twitch now, so you can support over there as well. Thanks so much to everybody. Let's get back to the video at hand. That doesn't mean it's not an absolutely amazing RPG for me. I made that video the other day talking about how this is one of the best RPGs I've ever played. Like best like single player RPGs. Uh specifically, I talked about first-person RPGs. But anyway, um performance is a is an ongoing process and it will be an ongoing process for them. Um, I'm playing on the Xbox Series X and as a general rule, the performance is pretty good. I am playing on the base, like the lowest resolution, which is 1920 x 1080. Um, because I play long sessions, I can play in 4K and it runs at a reasonable 30 frames a second. Anybody who about that has never played games like Red Dead Redemption 2, which still to this day only has a 30 frames per second mode. Stop getting hung up on frames because it doesn't matter at the end of the day. Um, but if you want more than 30, um, you do have to drop the resolution down and and play in. And people who's out there are saying like they removed the performance mode. No, they didn't. They just got rid of the terminology and you just scale it now versus do I want to play in 4K, 2K, or just regular highdev, 1920, 1080, and the game scales its performance adjust accordingly. Um, so there are some performance issues. Um, there are some audio issues with the voiceovers. Like sometimes voiceovers will be normal volume and then they get really quiet and then they're normal and get really quiet. Um, there's some mixing issues with audio we've noticed here and there. Um, there are some um screen tears that have happened from time to time. Um, I uh they've done three patches on the Xbox so far, I think. Um, and the most recent patch, um, I've had some graphical anomalies in the main keep that you start off at. Um, but it's not that big of a deal to me because I'm having such a great time. I don't really care about those little rough around the edges things because those are things that will get patched out over time. So, I just ignore those things and I move on and have fun playing the game cuz behind all of the rough edges is a really fun RPG that is the first game from this studio. Um, and I think for my money's worth, I'm happy to support this because it is something that's unique and different, and I'm getting a ton of enjoyment out of it. I've been playing games for almost 40 years now. Um, believe me, I have played way jankier, way buggier things than this. So, a little screen tearing from time to time, some performance hiccups, and some audio mixing issues are not enough for me to, you know, dock them any points because it's one of those things where I've already seen them make multiple patches since the game went live, which is what every company is going to do to support their game and they will continue to patch as the game gets further and further out from its initial launch date. So, um, a little rough around the edges, but other than that, it is an absolutely amazing RPG. I am having a great time. I saw someone say yesterday that Mortisible Gaming was at 80 hours and still not completed the game. So, I'm anticipating that I'm going to get probably 50 to 60 hours out of this because I don't do completionist versions like he does. Um although I do generally speaking try to do all the quests I see. I also, excuse me, I don't go out of my way to like explore every corner of the map. I don't do every single dungeon. There's probably, I think, a dozen dungeons and locations that I didn't do on the first map, which I did mention earlier. I just was like, I'm just following the story lane. I don't need need to explore every nook and cranny. Even though some of those nooks and crannies I have discovered, like Mog Mog's quest was hilarious. I think she's an awesome NPC. The voice actors who did Mog needs to win some awards cuz her voice acting was perfect for that character. and her quest is literally at the bottom of this crypt that you're never going to find unless you literally actively go into that crypt and go exploring and then you get down to the base and you're like, ""Wait a second, there's an NPC down here."" So, there's lots of little things to discover like that. Um, so great game, fun story, good voice acting, solid RPG, one of the best RPGs I've played in years. Definitely an amazing experience. Although again, rough around the edges, but they've already done multiple patches and they've got more patches coming in the pipeline, so they'll just continue to make it better and we will see where they go from here. So, for me to you, I'm having a great time. Hopefully, you're having a great time. Let me know in the comments down below. Like, subscribe, hit the bell icon so you never miss an update. The playlist also has a bunch of guides and stuff and also thoughts videos and beyond. But, I play a ton of other games, so make sure to check them all out. And we start every single day at around 5:00 a.m. Central on YouTube and Twitch. So, see you next time, everybody.",0.036,0.794,0.17,0.9999
EIx9MhOOD-g,2090,29,15,MOBLAND Episode 9 Recap And Review,20250525,"Eddie betrayed Mave to Conrad in episode 9 of Mobland, which in turn exposed Saraphina and Brendan's treachery to Richie. This caused Mave to question her trust in Eddie and may have her loyalty switched to Kevin. Antoine, Lord Pennock, Ysef, Khalil Hammed, Home Secretary Sui Sharma, and Bella all go to London to arrange a meeting, the point of which is never made clear, despite Paul's fears. A disturbing subplot involves Kevin, who is pretending to be Rusby's Uber driver, confronting and killing his Rusby. This shows Kevin's mental fragility and his subsequent desire for vengeance, and it also brings attention to the problem of male victims of sexual harassment. Conrad's racist comments and Jaimes calculating moves further strain the alliances during a tent sitdown at the Forkland Arms after Harry tells him about Jaime's impending meeting and provides information about Rich's fentinil operation. Tatisil uses threats and promises to get Alice, whose true name is Nicola, to infiltrate the Heragan household. A police tactical squad and air support are keeping tabs on her every move. The exchange between Mave and Gina hints at complicated family dynamics and changing allegiances among the DA Soua and Heragan families, as well as a possible insult regarding Gina's parentage and a caution to avoid Eddie. Tatisil and Rich's plot to use Alice as an informant and the waiting police unit suggests that Conrad and Mave will most likely be caught at the episode's conclusion, although Harry's loyalty is unclear and could change. The ninth episode of Mobland season 1 confronts the series impending conclusion. While it appears that staying hunkered down is the rule in Mobland, characters are free to come and go as they choose in the Cotsworlds. Although Pierce Brosman's character Conrad has a reputation for being a bit of a braggard, the only consequences for disrespecting this man are his wicked gazes and unfulfilled threats. However, such as the norm in Mobland. Just as plot points might become more significant in one episode before fading away in the next, characters can visit the Cotsworlds whenever they choose. In this ninth episode, Conrad has only just begun to bring up the subject of fentinil with the Mexicans. Thus far, there has been very little real progress. The series premiered with Fentinil. If the climaxes in Beggar's Banquet are any indication, there isn't going to be a happy ending to season 1. By this stage in Mobland's history, it would be pointless to go over every single story line. There doesn't appear to be a hierarchy of importance among them, and even while they all touch on one another, they aren't really connected. Despite their apparent connection, Harry's dealings with Cat and Rich's encounter with the police feel entirely separate. Even further distant are some plots. Kevin's relentless pursuit of revenge for his assault, a subject that Mobland insistences on revisiting in distressing detail, is straight out of another show. Considine has stepped up to the challenge of the more intricate arc, and Kevin now has more to accomplish than anybody else in Moblin thanks to this companion story. the clumsy handling of this subject, however, portends poorly for the climax. Kevin confronts the man responsible for his when he is in prison, but the sequence is executed so poorly that I am unsure if this charming Londoner was indeed Kevin's abuser. The plot and tone of the scenario are completely muddled. Kevin fires a gun at the old man, but he almost makes fun of it. With only one episode left, it appears implausible that they would find time to revisit this horrific tragedy for Kevin. But I can't believe it is ending. Beggar's Banquet ends in a same pitiful manner. This dinner scenario embodies all that Mobland has been aiming for this season. Unfortunately, the weak characters undermine the film's intended tone of intense morbid humor. Even though Tom Hardy might easily take the lead in a scene like the one they're aiming for. Harry sits at the head of the table and hardly speaks. He barely appears in a handful of the photos. Rather, our attention is drawn to Herrence Mave, Conrad, Jan, and Alice, who is their honored visitor. Jan stays silent because she is afraid. and Alice, who has been an exceptionally talented undercover agent from the day we met, has a hard time maintaining her disguise after answering even a single challenging question. The only remaining characters are Conrad and Mave, both of whom I am absolutely convinced are terribly miscast. Their supper is anything but relaxing and not in the way Moblan had hoped. They yell, argue, break bottles, and make unfunny jokes. Final twist. Once Conrad and Mave are both taken into custody, they quickly reconcile while simultaneously threatening each other with knives and bottles. It represents the series in miniature. The events of the past do not dictate the events of the future. No one remembers the promises or threats. In Mobland, moving on to the next scenario is more important than stopping to think about what just transpired. The reveal from the end of Helter Skelter has some nice payoffs, albeit in a generic way. There's a game of mental chess between the two waring sides and the scales are tipping against the heragrogens. Pieces are falling into place in an efficient manner and Toby Jones plays a good and convincing conniving villain. Unfortunately, the closing moments can't leave you too enthusiastic. What should be a firm act of defiance comes off more as awkward ramblings of two growingly insignificant people. The weird song number is juxtaposed to a concerted effort for normaly minutes earlier causing a disconnect. It conveys far less strength than people think it does. EOIC the season 1 penultimate episode fails to hype up Mobland heading into the finale. It is inconsistent with lazy repetitive writing and an awkward ending but further develops overarching themes and plots.",0.114,0.777,0.108,-0.7087
lLeXpUdwYvM,3513,1506,7,ExpressVPN Review💥Is ExpressVPN Worth It In 2025?,20250525,"Hi Everyone, Welcome to The Techno Galaxy. Thomas 
here & today I will be doing an ExpressVPN Review   in this video. I will mention all the Pros & 
also the cons of ExpressVPN, in this review,   so, Please sit back, relax & enjoy the review.
Now, If you need a top-of-the-line VPN that's   committed to transparency and user privacy, or 
even if you're a casual user who simply wants   a VPN that's fast and excellent for streaming, 
ExpressVPN should be at the top of your list.   You will pay more, than you would 
for other virtual private networks,   but ExpressVPN continues to exceed the competition 
for users who want the most out of their VPN.
  ExpressVPN has servers in 94 countries which is 
huge. They offer best quality data encryption.   They have 24 7 live customer support & 
ExpressVPN works on every platform like,   iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux & More.
You can also install & use ExpressVPN on 8   devices at the same time, which might 
come very handy if you need to use it   on all of your devices at the same time. 
ExpressVPN continues to prove that it takes   privacy seriously and that it's worthy of one 
of the best VPN designation. Its total of 12   independent security audits in 2022 alone 
sets ExpressVPN apart from its competitors,   and is a testament to its ever-increasing 
transparency efforts. And its TrustedServer   technology helps establish its place as 
a VPN provider that has what it takes to   protect users with critical privacy needs. 
One good thing about them is that, they also   don't keep any user-logs that can be linked 
back to a particular user, which should give   you a mental satisfaction, that, your sensitive 
data will never be stored online.
  I personally like ExpressVPN because 
it's very simple and straightforward   to use. They have a very simple user 
interface. The connect button over here,   once you click on it, you can connect.
If you want to check different servers,   you can click on the three dots, and it 
gives you a complete breakdown of all the   different locations that are available, the 
different servers that you can connect to.
  You can connect to Asia Pacific, 
America, Europe and the Middle East. 
  Having all these different countries and 
different servers available, gives you an   opportunity to connect and find resources 
and content in these particular countries   like if you want to watch the streaming 
services available in another country.
  Now coming back to the actual VPN, this 
has a lot of options to protect you.
  You can launch ExpressVPN on windows 
startup, you can connect to the last   used location.You have a Network 
lock and split tunneling as well.
  About the protocols, ExpressVPN automatically 
connects and picks the most appropriate protocol   for your network, but if you're an individual 
that want to use it for specific needs,   you can easily select the protocol 
that really works for you.
  And. like I previously mentioned, you can 
connect all your devices at the same time,   to ensure that your mobile phone, 
your tablet, your laptop, and your   Desktop are all protected at the same time. 
ExpressVPN is also very good for streaming. So,   for example, if you want to watch a Netflix show 
which is only available in a specific region or   country, you can just connect to that location 
& watch the show. It's as simple as that.
  In our streaming test, we did not find any 
lag or buffering & it was smooth.
  Now, about the Cons of this VPN. ExpressVPN is not 
cheap. Please Don't get me wrong for saying this.   ExpressVPN is a Top of the line Premium VPN, but 
you might find their pricing on the higher side.   But after using them personally for the past few 
years, I would say that the pricing is justified,   as ExpressVPN is a very safe & fast 
VPN which is also best for Streaming,   works on all devices & doesn't collect any 
logs.The interface is also very simple to use.
  So, that's it for today guys. After 
watching this ExpressVPN review,   if you decided to give ExpressVPN a try, I have 
included a Discounted link for ExpressVPN in   the video description box down below, so you 
can check that out if you are interested.

I had a quick meeting in the morning and then I headed out to meet my friend to head to Newberry Street. We had a snowstorm last night which is why it is so white and beautiful outside. We tried out a new restaurant that was delicious and then we went to a cafe to study and we were here for a good 3 hours. I studied for a quiz tomorrow which was the only thing on my to-do list so I spent the rest of my time posting and editing some videos. I finished my sweet treat and then we went to go get the viral Dubai chocolate strawberries. These were so delicious. Worth the hype, but I don't know if it was worth the $20. Afterwards, we headed back to campus and someone made this adorable snowman. I changed and headed to dance rehearsal for the next 2 hours and after that I got ready for bed. I checked answers for a homework assignment with a friend and then I of course had to do my full nighttime unwind routine. Today was such an amazing Sunday and I decided to sleep a little bit earlier so I could wake up tomorrow morning for a nice morning routine. I hope you also had an amazing day with fun and productivity.",0.0,0.789,0.211,0.9953
XksJ19eEnZ0,7154,634,18,"Life, Liberty & Levin 5/25/25 FULL END SHOW | BREAKING FOX NEWS May 25, 2025",20250526,"Hello America, I'm Mark Levvin and this is Life, Liberty and Levvin Memorial Day Sunday special Memorial Day. Memorial Day represents our honoring once a year, although here we do it every every day those who have died in defense of our country and our way of life and our liberty. Very little is said about this during the course of the year. Instead, we have to hear the reprobates, the riotist protesters telling us how horrible we are, telling us that they want to overthrow our country. We see this on our college campuses, and we see it in a more subtle way right through the uh television tube with the media and how the media cover the United States. We are a great people. We are a fantastic people. We're not a perfect people, but we're great people. And we're more perfect than other societies. That's for sure. We talk a lot about foreign policy, although not exclusively here. We talk about domestic policy, the constitution, you know, the border and all the rest. But why do we talk about foreign policy? Why do we talk about the Middle East? Why do we talk about Ukraine and Russia? Why do we talk about China and the threats in our own hemisphere? Memorial Day again, what's it about? It's the men and women who've gone overseas to fight wars. Some of them we don't even know about. Others that are world wars to save our republic. To protect our allies, our way of life, humanity, mankind. That's why we talk about these issues because they're life and death. And let me just say here on this Memorial Day Sunday, I could not be prouder of the fact that we have the right administration and the right president in place who's got the sense, who's got the ideas, who loves our country and loves the people of this country and does everything he can to make sure there are less people in those graves in our military sites and elsewhere across the country. So, let's start tonight's special program with a dear friend of the program, retired four-star General Jack Keane, with a deep dive into the state of the US military, our readiness, America's national security strategy in the imminent global threats. We're here with our friend, General Jack Keane, retired fourstar army general. That's no small potatoes. Fox News senior strategic analyst. General, it's good to have you here. I have no doubt that you're keeping an eye on public reports on uh I guess what's going on with Iran and our country in terms of negotiations. The best we have are little leaks here and there and so forth. But I I want to ask you a few questions. Um, are we serious if we believe that Iran is undertaking these nuclear activities to increase its domestic energy when it is selling oil to the communist Chinese domestic energy? Do you need weaponsgrade fisal material for domestic energy? Iran is going to civil nuclear energy as part of this deal for one reason and one reason only. so they can graduate that program to a nuclear weapons program. That is where they is. What what I find it absolutely stunning about this, Mark, is the Obama administration back prior to 2015 when they cut a deal with the Iranians began on the exact same footing that the Trump administration is. You must dismantle the program. You must give up your enrichment uranium. You must destroy your advanced centures. and you must give up your ballistic missiles. That was the start point. What they wound up with was something quite different. And it appears that we are on the same path, quite amazing. And that path is Iran, you can have civil nuclear power with lower yield enriched uranium, something less than 4% which was in the Obama deal. This is what I'm told is being discussed and and that is supposedly not a nuclear weapons program. Mark, in 2025, this is a distinction that no longer has a difference between civilian nuclear power and Iran's nuclear weapons program. That's the reality of it. Why? Because Iran has advanced centrifuges and a manufacturing capability for them that in a matter of weeks can take this low-level enriched uranium for nuclear power purposes and I mean in a few weeks and have it at weapons grade ready to build and deploy nuclear weapons. That is what we're facing. So to allow them to have quote civilian nuclear power, if that is really what's happening, that makes no sense given the reality of where Iran is today. And where is Iran today? They basically lost most of their capacity on their groundtoair missile systems. The Israelis took out most of it. It's a very poor country right now thanks to President Trump's um severe conditions that he's placed on them as well as the Israelis hitting many of their gas lines. The people there hate the government. Absolutely hate it. There is no popular will for that government. Uh their proxies are all on their backs. The United States, thanks to us, the Houthis are on their backs thanks to the Israelis. Hamas and Hezbollah. Nobody ever thought Hezbollah could be defeated. They've been defeated. What What do you think is the mindset here? I'm quite concerned. Uh because uh anytime that you at least start talking about this uh there's a little group of people in the u sort of the peanut gallery that go on about wararm mongers wararm mongers. I mean you were a general a four-star general. You you're not a wararm monger are you? You're concerned about what's going on right? Oh yeah absolutely. I mean, when uh President Bush had decided the first week in December, two weeks after we toppled the Taliban to go into Iraq, I was the uh the fourstar in the meeting, not with him, but just among ourselves and said, ""Why? This doesn't make any sense. We're going after the al-Qaeda."" No. Uh and most generals are not looking for a fight. They're looking to prevent a war. That is kind of where we come from in the United States. We reflect the values of the American people. But what you just read down the list of where Iran is is exactly right. I would only add to that their economy is really in a tank and it has to do with their currency is out of sh out of sight and in terms of its evaluation and also inflation is in double digits somewhere around close to 30%. So the impact on the people to include the middle class and even the elites who are all supportive of the regime because they drive around in Mercedes-Benz, they wear designer clothes, jewelry, etc. All of that the people are opposed to the direction Iran is taking. That is a reality. They are more vulnerable today than they have been in 44 years. So I think we have huge leverage here with them. one with increased sanctions and two the threat of an air attack joined by the United States and Israel together. We should not give up that leverage. You're retired fourstar general. Uh you have quite a bit of knowledge about that area of the world, your own experience. What might obviously this is it could be anything but what might it look like if we or the Israelis the Israelis with our support would have to take out these nuclear sites. Yeah. Well, first of all, the this nuclear enterprise is widespread. There's over a dozen targets and some of them as you indicated are deeply buried 250 300 feet in the ground. thick thick walls to protect those uh those sites. So, it it's not an easy target. And yes, the Israelis could go it alone. It would be very limited what they could do. They could damage them and they could set them back. That's a fact. And and of course, to remind our audience, the use of nuclear weapons by Iran against uh Israel is an existential threat. So, they're in this for their very survival. I'm talking about Israel. Our motivation is obviously to support Israel and prevent that from happening. But if Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, there would be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. All the Arab nations, the principal ones who are going to get nuclear weapons. That brings into question and and the reality that we could have the first nuclear exchange of weapons uh in the world and that takes place over the volatility of the Middle East. So this is a major security issue for the United States as well. Although not necessarily an existential threat like it is for Israel, the United States, if it joined it, would be able to deal with those deep buried targets because of the aircraft that flies those deep penetration bombs and they are US aircraft. That would still mean that we couldn't destroy the entire enterprise, but we could set it back for a number of years. And that's why it it certainly has value. And after an attack like that, Iran would be even more vulnerable than it is right now, particularly with increased sanctions on it to make a permanent deal with the United States going forward. Stop funding the proxies in the region entirely. Cut those relationships off. give up the rest of your ballistic missiles that we haven't haven't destroyed and join with the United States and the countries in the region in a in a lateral multilateral agreement that establishes peace and stability in the region. It gives us a huge leverage to do something like that. Iran wants this weapon because they want the option to be able to have that weapon and use it as leverage. That's how they preserve their regime. They believe Saddam Hussein would still be in power today if he had a nuclear weapon. They watched what happened in Gaddafi when he gave up his weapon. The people rose up and killed him. They know full well the people in Iran are on the cutting edge of rising up and doing something very similar to that. So this is the motivation that's going on. I do believe that the joint strike Israel and the United States in the long run is likely to be the best option for the reasons we just stated. It will fundamentally delay the program. If we go the other route and cut a deal that allows them to have enrichment and centures, they're going to get a weapon. They're going to get a weapon in a matter of weeks at a secret site that we don't know exists. That is who Iran is. They cheat and they will cheat regardless of who they're cutting the deal with. Next up, folks, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, brings expert analysis on our global defense strategy. We'll be right back. Welcome back to this special episode of Life, Liberty, and Levvin. Richard Kemp joined me a few weeks ago to offer insight on what he believes is going on in the minds of the Iranian regime. Plus, he dissects what the often used term wararmonger really means. We're here with a good friend of of mine and my family, retired Colonel, British forces in Afghanistan, commander Richard Kemp, chairman of the Cobra Intelligence Group. But Richard Kemp, um, they can't call you a chicken hawk. You're a combat veteran. You have fought in Afghanistan and elsewhere. You have fought terrorists. You know this mindset. So, Richard Kemp, what is the mindset of the Iranian regime? And do you think that they would adhere for the first time ever to some kind of ironclad agreement? No, I think the the Iranian a nuclear armed Iran would represent the greatest threat to Western civilization and of course to the Middle East that's ever existed since the Second World War. And that's partly because of the potency of nuclear weapons and it's partly because of the mentality of the Iranian fanatical jihadist regime. They they're not like the Russians. They're not like China even. They're not a country that is amanable to reason or indeed to the concept of mutual mutual assured destruction which you mentioned earlier. They if if we if we if they have a nuclear weapon and we believe they intend to use it, we've got to assume that that's a very real danger. They've said many times death to America. It's part of the entire basis of the Iranian regime. Death to America, death to Israel. And we can't assume that if they have it, if they have the capability, they won't use it. Only a few days ago, Hani, the the supreme leader of Iran, explained in detail why he needs to destroy Israel. So, we've got to assume that they will that if they have a nuclear weapon, they will use it. And there is only one way of preventing them from gaining that nuclear weapon which they're already very advanced in their program very advanced both in terms of developing highlyenriched uranium working on the means of delivering it ballistic missiles and also through weaponizing the program. They're very close. Uh if not if not it's possible even they have the capability today and there's only one way of stopping that and that's by military action to destroy their nuclear program once and for all. Now there is a possibility of negotiations. But we know one thing. We know that Iran are master negotiations. They're masters of deception. They're masters of lying. They're masters of dragging out and drawing out any negotiations while they're meanwhile working on the program. So although I can understand why President Trump is interested in negotiations, personally I don't think that they're going to achieve what needs to be achieved here. And I think we're going to we're going to face a a real problem with things like verification. We can't just accept a paper promise by them. We've got to see verifiable actual dismantling of their regime, of their nuclear program. We've got to see the enriched uranium shipped out of that country or destroyed. And we've got to see their entire infrastructure for developing weaponization, developing nuclear weapons. That's got to be dismantled verifiably, not just on paper. And my my view is that Iran is not going to agree to that. Iran is going to have to Iran is going to maybe spin it out, lie, deceive, and no doubt be assisted by the Europeans who don't have the spine to support an attack on Iran. Europeans are very likely in my view to to to help them maybe inadvertently, but help them to to spin out this negotiation while they uh while they continue to develop their program. So yeah, negotiate, but make sure it's for a very limited period of time. Make sure if it does achieve come come to some conclusion, it is absolutely practically verifiable. And then if not, if that if if the period of time that they've been given, which I think President Trump gave them 60 days, if that's not achieved, then they have to be hit and hit very hard by the United States of America, probably supported by Israel, to destroy their nuclear program. one generation after another. I mean, the reason parents exist, the reason a generation exists is to make sure the next generation is safe and secure, not just survives, but thrives. If Iran gets nuclear weapons, what happens to that whole chain of of humanity? If this generation doesn't act to stop the Iranian nuclear threat right now in its tracks and we may already be getting towards the point where it's going to be too late then they will have betrayed we will have betrayed the foregoing generations such as your father and your grandfather who fought in the second world war and the many many other millions of Americans British and allies who fought in the second world war. We would have betrayed them. They brought us peace. They've removed a hugely threatening terror regime regimes from us. And if we don't continue that and we don't continue to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to buy safety for our generation and for future generations, then we can be looked at as being traitors and cowards. I think we have no option. We have no choice. We just have to look at, for example, what's going on in Europe now at the devastating war in Ukraine with President Biden having been deterred from taking the necessary action to support Ukraine by Russia's nuclear weapons, that was bad enough. But if you imagine a fanatical jihadist terrorist regime in control of similar weapons, then what kind of deterrent is that going to impose upon the United States, the Europeans, Middle Eastern countries? It's going to be it's going to be beyond devastating. And that's even assuming they don't use it. But I think we have to assume they will use it. If this regime says they want death to America and they want death to Israel and they want death to other Arab countries in the Middle East, which they do, and they have the capability of doing it, we should never assume they will not use it. We should assume absolutely they would use it and therefore it's absolutely our obligation to deal with it. History has shown us what happens when we appease. We've been through a couple of decades of appeasement of Iran now. uh and and that has to stop. We've allowed them by appeasement to get further and further down the road of developing a nuclear weapon. They're now at a point where they're on the verge of it. And not only that, but they're also extremely vulnerable. This is the ideal opportunity to put a stop to it. Israel destroyed their air defense capabilities. Israel has destroyed the vast majority of their proxy organizations that were put in place like Hezbollah to act as a deterrent against a nuclear strike against a strike against Iran's nuclear capabilities. Those have gone pretty much and so the ground is wide open and the opportunity is there and it needs to be taken. It needs to be taken as you say by Israel but also backed up by the United States. Israel has a has a certain amount of capability to deal with it, but it requires assistance and support from the United States and that I think would be the most momentous decision that President Trump would take in his entire presidency both terms to support Israel and to to do whatever the US needs to do itself in annihilating this nuclear program. What do you say to people who call people like you and me war mongers? War mongers. Are we trying to prevent the annihilation of millions of human beings by a terrorist organization that will blackmail, that will bully, that has demonstrated that it is more than willing to see and be involved in the death the the death of innocent civilians? It's a terrible thing to be encouraging what would be devastating military action against Iran. People would die. Large numbers of people probably would die. And it's a terrible thing to be advocating that. But with Hiroshima, as was Nag Nagasaki, those were really tragic but nevertheless vital means of preventing far far greater deaths. And I think that's, you know, those people who refer to uh you and I and others as wararmongers, they're simply ignorant people or indeed they're they've been they've allowed themselves to be influenced by those people who want to who who want to preserve the Iranian nuclear program. And of course, don't forget there is a very largecale propaganda war going on throughout the world, organized by Iran and its allies, including Russia and China to convince people that it's us danger. It's not Iran that's in danger. The reality, as I said at the beginning, Iran represents a nuclear armed Iran would represent the greatest danger that the Western world and the Middle East has known since the Second World War. When we return, our buddy Dr. Zuti Jasser pulls no punches as he breaks down what's really going on with the Islam Nazi regime in Iran. We'll be right back. Welcome back, America. Hope you're enjoying your Memorial Day weekend Sunday edition with our brilliant guests who are sounding the alarm about the global threats we face. Now, Dr. Nazi Jasser knows the Middle East and the terrorist regimes that threaten Israel and our way of life. He's written extensively about the Islamazi Iranian regime for years and has a unique perspective. We're here with our friend Dr. Zudi Jasser, president American Islamic Forum for Democracy, co-founder Muslim Reform Movement. Zuti Jasser. Uh there's not much of a debate in this country over whether or not Iran should have nuclear weapons, but there is a little cabal out there of kind of knuckleheads who say, ""Well, okay, if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, what's the big deal?"" And uh anybody who thinks otherwise is a wararmonger and wants to drag us into war and so forth and so on. So, I wanted you to help us understand the mindset of that regime in Iran and why it is so deadly for them to have a nuclear weapon. What is your thinking on this? Yeah, you know, Mark, this is so important to understand. These are not just any typical war, you know, rogue country, the Islamists, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iran that took over in 1979. They're they're they're the founding fathers of suicide bombing. Hezbollah's first suicide bombing in Lebanon that killed our troops in 1983 ultimately then sprouted suicide bombing across the region with not only Shia side but the Sunni side with al-Qaeda and others. So ultimately when when the president of Iran uh whether it was Ahmed Jad or Raisi last year or others when they start speaking at the general assembly of the United Nations they talk about ushering in the 12th Imam. That ushering in of the 12th I imam mark is an endof time scenario. It's an esquetology in which Armageddon happens. So ultimately a country that advocates suicide bombing and fuels the Houthis fuels Hamas fuels Hezbollah every radical actor in the region as a country would want to commit fratricside because they see their government as God. They see their government as fighting the evils the Satans the great Satan and the little Satan of Israel and the great Satan of America. So that bigoted, hateful, anti-semitic country, if they as run by the Islamists, if they have a nuclear weapon, will ultimately use it because it's not about like Russia where they had mutually assured destruction and Reagan's peace through strength suppress them because they didn't want to die. These guys are a death cult. They want to die. So they can't have a nuclear weapon. And Israel has thankfully been leading the charge and not only decimating Hezbollah with pagers in September, killing Nasra Law, President Trump in his first term killed Slemani and others. So they're on their heels and we can't let them have a nuclear weapon. Impossible. What do you say to those Jasser who say well you know uh it's Israel trying to drag us into a war. These wararm mongers, these neocons trying to drag us into a war. I guess Donald Trump is now a wararmonger and a neocon and an Israeli. I don't know. Uh but that said, um aren't we really talking about the capacity to to destroy some of our cities with intercontinental ballistic missiles? We don't have an iron dome like Israel has. We don't really have a system in place to systematically prevent hypersonic or at least intercontinental ballistic missiles from hitting our country. They don't need intercontinental ballistic missiles which they've developed to hit Israel. Those are intermediary missiles. These intercontinental ballistic missiles are intended to go 7,000 mi, 12,000 mi, however number of miles they need to go as they fully develop the technology and so forth. Why should we sit back, listen to this cabal who says, ""Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Got the whole future of mankind at stake here."" No, absolutely. You know, listen, I was the Navy officer as a doc, and the last thing I want to see is is fighting wars, unnecessary wars. But I will tell you, the wararm mongers are the one that the ones that would allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. The wararmongers are the ones that would not actually try to prevent their nuclear armamentation. And that's what Obama was. That's what Biden was. The JCPOA, let me remind you, back from 2016, basically handed them billions that then under Biden, they funneled to Hamas to then basically allow a genocide against Israel, against the Jews and commit the act of war of October 7. And then Israel has had to protect itself since then because Iran funneled money to Hamas and use that to spark more wars. So ultimately today, President Trump is annihilating Houthis because they are targeting our ships. So I'm sorry if we sit back, they're going to attack us. We need to prevent wars by doing surgical strikes to prevent nuclear armamentation. And ultimately, their breakout time has decreased because of the Biden fecklessness. And we need to broaden that. And at if we get them to the table, which I hope President Trump can do, it's all about disarmamentation, not about handing them money. We need to have maximum pressure, weaken their economy, because ultimately, Mark, the best anti-uclear program will be to weaken their economy. Because the reason the Iranian people are so proTrump and pro-America because they saw their last revolution during the first Trump administration in 2017 happened when the economic spine of Iran was breaking. And now it's going to break again as we reimpose maximum pressure and it allow the revolutions to happen and we can step back and just as long as we make sure they don't have nuclear weapons. Author of the coming collapse of China, Gordon Chang gives us an inside look at what is not so secretly unfolding with the Communist Party of China right before our very eyes. We'll be right back. Gordon Chang recently joined me to break down the increasing global threats from communist China and what Xiinping's vision of a China dominant world looks like. We're here with our friend Gordon Chang. There's a lot going on in communist China that I want him to explain to us which makes it even more dangerous. Also his view on how President Trump's tariffs are actually a good thing when it comes to dealing with communist China and so forth. One thing at a time here, Gordon, welcome. What is going on in the hierarchy of the Communist Party of China? You uh you're saying they're having a little uh little spat. There is intense infighting at the top of the Communist Party and we got to remember that the People's Liberation Army reports to the party and at the top of the PLA um there are purges and counterpes and we're trying to figure out what's going on. But I think it's actually far more serious than people talk about. So for instance, the number three uniformed officer in the Chinese military, General Hway Dong has not been seen in public since March 11th. Now H was the hatchet man for Cining, but people are saying, well, you know, Cining just sacked another one general over corruption. Well, I don't think that's the case. The objective factors suggest that General Hu was actually sacked by Cining's opponents at the top of the Chinese military. In other words, Cining's loyalists are now starting to disappear. And if that's indeed the case, then what we have is allout fighting at the top of the Chinese military, which means that the Chinese regime could very well be on the cliff of disintegration. Now when you say the regime might be on the cliff of disintegration that doesn't necessarily mean the communist party and the communist infrastructure entirely. It means that there's a fight at the top like you know when Stalin died there was a fight at the top and uh uh and so forth and so on. Is that your point? Yeah, that's the point. The Communist Party is a massive uh uh organization. You know, it's close to 100 million members. Um and so this infighting is not all 100 million members but it is where it counts at the polit bureau standing committee which is the apex of political power in the Chinese system and also at the central military commission of the communist party that is the top decision-making body in the Chinese military and there have been a number of disappearances and these go back to about the middle of 2023 where we're seeing top commanders and top commisaars lose their jobs in unexplained circumstances. And really what this indicates is that the infighting is now actually accelerating. Part of the problem is because China is undergoing some massive problems, especially the economy. The economy is not growing at the 5.0% pace that they claim for 2024. It may not be growing at all. And Cining is being blamed for that. And that's rightly so since he's taken China in the wrong direction. which means that uh people are now starting to come out of the shadows and undermine him and in some cases actually um challenge him openly in public. Well, that is amazing. Now, um doesn't he still have enough power to put this down if he wants to? You're suggesting no, he doesn't. Yeah, that's a great question. Cinping has closed up the Chinese political system. So we see less and less of it and so um this is a bit murky but we are seeing signs that are not consistent with stability and we're seeing signs that are not consistent with Cining in control. So for instance going back to the general Hui Dong who is Cining's man um the fact that he loses his job u and at the same time we are seeing Chinese propaganda uh military propaganda organs openly criticize Cining by praising what they call quote unquote collective leadership. That's a direct slap at Cinping. Um which means that he's not in control of the Chinese military. Now even if one were to take the most benign view that Cining is causing all of these purges it means the military is also not under his control because even in that case uh if it were under control we wouldn't be having all of these firings and disappearances. But as I said it appears that Cining's people are being sacked by Cining's opponents. After the break, you don't want to miss the impressive Rebecca Hindrix, who tells us why Trump is our most consequential president. We'll be right back. Bubble on mobile Hello. Move it on.

4EgzG_qC8zU,944,124,13,💡 TOP 10 BEGINNER TIPS for Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time!,20250526,"Fantasy Life Eye is finally here. And if you're just starting your Cozy Island adventure, I've got 10 essential tips to make sure that you don't waste time and have the best start possible. Hey cozy gamers, it's Abdala here and I've been deep diving into Fantasy Life Eye, the girl who stole time. Now, whether you're a 3DS veteran or a brand new player to the series, here's how to get ahead fast without the grind. So stay tuned for the top 10 tips. Tip number one is to unlock all the lives early. As you can see over here, these are all of the 14 lives, and you'll be able to get them all throughout your entire time with Fantasy Life. Now, all of these lives can be unlocked at the very, very beginning of the game, but it does require you to go talk to some NPCs and do some tutorials. Don't worry, you can absolutely skip the tutorials if you play the 3DS version before. Now, keep in mind that the brand new life called the farmer and the brand new life called the artist, these are not unlockable at the beginning of the game. So, if you're looking forward to these, keep on playing the main story and you'll get those unlocked in no time. Tip number two is focusing on one combat life. Now, don't spread yourself too thin. Pick one combat life and focus on it. It'll save you tons of time and experience in your gameplay. Now, of course, there's four of them here. You can see the paladin wields the sword and shield. So, uh, you can shield attacks. You got to get in close, make your opening, swipe your sword. Um, or if you want even more bigger numbers, you can use the great sword right over here with the mercenary. The next class is one that I decided to focus on, which was the hunter, which allows you to attack from a distance with all these different arrows. You can do arrow rain. You can use paralysis arrows, poison arrows, uh, even sleep arrows um, to deal some damage from afar. And if you also like the ranged attackers, you can also pick up the magician class, which will allow you to do healing spells, attacking spells, and even defensive spells. So, choose one and go all in because ultimately what you want to do is level them up and get some of these skills unlocked. As you can see, each of these classes has a tree uh that you'll be able to use on all of these different skill points. Now, that being said, we want to be able to get as much of it as possible, but if you're out here ranking up mercenary, ranking up paladin, and ranking up m magician at the exact same time, you're going to spread yourself way too thin. So, choose one and go all in. Tip number three is using life synergy. Some lives go together like peanut butter and jelly. Mining gets ore, which you can use for the blacksmith in order to make weapons, and using those weapons for the mercenary or the paladin. Boom. perfect synergy. Now, another three life example of life synergy would be using a wood cutter to chop up some wood in which you're going to give to the carpenter life to craft weapons for the hunter or the mage. Now, it's all connected, so keep that in mind if you're got if you're going to play the game in a way that you don't want to master all the lives. But if you're the opposite, then have at it. Master every single life. Tip number four is tracking quests for easy rankups. Now, I want you guys to be playing this game at your leisure. You don't have to rush to the finish line. Honestly, you can play it however you want, but don't forget about the quest tab. I want you to check this often. You'll complete stuff just by playing. Now, each completed quest over here, you can see uh that it it is highlighted in yellow. If we finished it, uh this one says, you know, get howls from the grotto. I have to knock out 15 of the howls. And then once I do so, I'll be rewarded 600 star points. Now, if you take a look in the top screen over there, if you press triangle or whatever button shows up on screen, you can see over here, in order to get to the next rank, um I need a lot more. I need 8,500 in order to get to master to hero for hunter right over this way. So, I'm going to keep on looking around and checking it um as much as I can. Now, as soon as you're done with uh getting any of these check marks and you have enough of the points to rank up, then go visit your uh your little master and then rank up accordingly. Now, on this screen, you could also go over and check up on every single one of yours. So, for example, if I'm looking at, you know, how many things I need in order to rank up for farmer, what things, what checkbox simulator things do I have to do? There we go. I have to use Grand Harvest 20 times to get my last thing. Then I I can become a hero and rank up. So, you're going to be doing a lot of this stuff automatically. So, just don't forget to just keep up on this every single time. And when you notice you have enough points, go over to your master and then rank up. It's awesome. Tip number five is spending your skill points smart. Now, every time you level up, you get points to spend on your life skill tree. Now, go over here in your main menu skillboard, and you'll be able to see it right over here. Your best bet is to zoom out and check out what each of the nodes do. Some boost damage, some even unlock some new abilities. Now, don't sleep on this menu. There's tons to explore. And my tips for this one would really be towards going towards whatever new moves you get. Um, honestly, when it comes to combat ones, you want to be able to find new charge attacks such as this one. So, start paying for the nodes that go over that way. Um, same thing for magician and all the paladins and mercenary classes. Find all the special moves that you can unlock. Now, when it comes to the gathering classes, um, such as mining, such as wood cutting, um, angling or farming right over this way, you want to do the exact same thing. You want to find whatever charge attacks are over there and then unlock those as you progress through your different ranks. Now, when it comes to the crafting characters, I would highly suggest doing the entire left node right over this way. This is honestly one of your first things that you want to do is because it it boosts the miniame time limit uh by a couple percentages and of course it also gives you some experience boost gains which helps you grow a lot faster. Now the reason why you want more time for the mini games is because then you'll allow to get a lot more excellence whenever you click on those things and more excellence means better product multiple product at the same time and like top quality stuff that you can sell for even more stuff. So when it comes down to cook, when it comes down to blacksmith, do this entire left node. Carpenter, the exact same thing. Prioritize on this one and then branch out to the other ones before going there. Tip number six is going to be selling extra weapons for do. Now, if you're running low on money, now is the time to sell all of your extra weapons. Seriously, you'll collect tons of them uh from beating up enemies and gathering. Keep what you need and then literally sell the rest. So, the first thing you want to do is absolutely go over to your equipment menu on the very bottom. Um, it shows auto equip that you can press or you can kind of go through over here and see what kind of uh weapons you actually have over here and see if it gives any plus stats. I'm equipping my perfect one right now with 591. Everything else is the worst, so I don't necessarily need those bows anymore. So, go through over here with any of the shops that you have available. Uh, you can indeed filter by uh bows. You can filter by everything. And then over here you'll be able to see, oh, hey, heads up. I've got two black dragon bows. Don't necessarily need those. Got a crystal bow over here. That's great. Love to see it. Um, so sell that stuff. And then, you know, press a sell button. There we go. I just made 7,000 d'Ache by selling a weapon that I'm probably never going to use. So, do the exact same thing. But, of course, you don't have to do just the bows. You can go through all of your different weapons over here. If you filter by, let's go rank, um, you'll see all the different ones that have rank. over here like, do I necessarily need all these claymores? No, I do not. Right? Do I need all these swords of darkness? No, I do not. So, sell all that stuff. This is going to be your best way to make money. And in a couple seconds, I was literally able to make over 30,000 uh do'ach in the game. So, sell all your stuff. You don't need them. Tip number seven is auto equip smartly. Flutter charm alert. Now, if you guys paid attention in the earlier tip, I talked about the equipment menu over here. It is super helpful. You want to be able to have the best stats possible. Now, I did mention on the bottom right over there, there's an auto equip button, which will give you the best items and set you up so you don't have to scroll through a hundred different things. It's literally awesome. So, use that. But, of course, if you purchase the digital deluxe version and you have the flutter charm available, now this item right over here is exclusive to that. Uh, it gives you 10% more experience earned. Obviously, if I press auto equip right now, it's going to change up all of my equipment and get rid of the flutter charm simply because there's a cog over here that gives me, I don't know, some other things and more stat boosts. But of course, I really like the idea of using the 10% uh extra experience. So, like why wouldn't you? And I got it. Um, so keep that in mind right over here. So, yeah, use auto equip to make sure that you have everything that way. And you'll also notice on the top header, this is just for my hunter uh life right over this way. So if I wanted to go through with my magician life, every time I turn into magician, you want to make sure that we are equipped in the correct way. So now even though I clicked on auto equip, um that one took away my flutter charm. So, just really go through every single one of your classes and just double check with auto equip and flutter charm so that you have your best materials possible whenever you're going into those things because some people don't realize that even though you're maning hunter right now, as soon as you go in a crafting bench, you're going to switch into your blacksmith outfits or your blacksmith loadout and it could be all your beginner gear. So, really focus on that and double check after autoequipping. Tip number eight is fast traveling like a pro. Now, as we know, Fantasy Life has done awesome with quality of life over here. Open up your map and you can fast travel anywhere that you visited. Seriously, no joke. So, if you open up map right over this way, if you press up and down, you'll be able to go from present to past to Ginormosia. Um, I love the idea of clicking into a certain area like Eternia Village, zooming out, and seeing exactly where you can uh travel to. Right over here is just the base area. You can press the R button to scroll over to the capital of Mysteria and you can see some different spots. Um, as you unlock different caves, you'll be able to travel to them. Right over this way, there's some Kettzel Nest. There's uh the Warren Willow Hollow. Far Away Island has a warp over here. It has a warp over here. There's a lot of ways that you can travel around and kind of get used to the map so that you don't have to go there all on foot. Yeah, learn this. It's actually super helpful. Now, there's two other ways of traveling that not too many people know about and I'll teach you it right here. As you press the plus button, if you go to your life or if you do the life shortcut from the I don't know main area, there's going to be a square button on the bottom right over here that says go to lifemaster, it'll automatically warp you to the lifemaster location. So, if you are working on hunter lives and all of the different skills, you can easily come over here to your master, turn them in, and rank up, which is really fun. And then lastly, there's also a something called the teleportation gate, which is a way that you can fast travel to your last spot in Ginormosia, which is going to be a little bit later on in the game, which is the like the Breath of the Wild open world concept of it. So, if I was over here exploring on this little island um inside this huge map, like I love using that teleportation, that really just brings me to that exact spot versus the warping over to the main nodes or to the different towers. So, anyway, learn the fast travel, learn the map, and go from there. Tip number nine is prioritizing the main story first. Now, it's tempting, very, very tempting to grind lives right away, but trust me, knock out the main story first. It's short, it's sweet, and it unlocks so much in postgame. Think of it as a cozy intro before the real adventure begins. Tip number 10 is choosing the right buddies. Buddies will join your party later, so you'll want to pick them wisely. Now, combat buddies are super fun, for sure, but crafting and gathering buddies can mine giant ore deposits with you or help craft the perfect gear, so you'll want to prioritize those. Now, taking a look at your buddies in your party, there's going to be a total of 49/50 of them throughout the game. You'll be able to get all of the different ones that are for the battling ones. You'll have three of each of the gathering ones, and you'll have three of each of the crafting ones. You really want to focus on two of each of every single one of the lives. Now, being said, you can take a look at each of these buddies and see what kind of unique skills they have by clicking the triangle button or just whatever button shows up over there. Now, for example, Pino over here, um, if he gets maxed out at five hearts, um, he's going to do 20% damage when harvesting fruits plus 30 farming. You'll notice that Butch, even though he's a farmer, he might be a little bit different. Uh, this guy does more harvesting towards vegetables. Now, you also look at Royson over here. Um, you can see over here 20% damage on leafy greens. There's a little bit more. So, be a little picky and choosy when it comes to your buddies in the game, but really focus on the crafting ones and uh the gathering ones so that you guys can get even better excellence when it comes to making the perfect gear or, you know, cutting down that huge tree that you're having a hard time doing solo. Well, there you go, cozy gamers. 10 tips to get the most out of Fantasy Life Eye right from the start. Now, let me know which of these lives you're starting out with down in the comments below.

kT7D0ACXdnM,8920,856,59,"Leap of Faith | Audio Reading | Our Daily Bread Devotional | May 24, 2025",20250524,"Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. Hebrews 11:1. Welcome to today's encouragement from our daily bread. Our reading titled leap of faith was written by Nancy Gabianis and read by Rochelle Trout. [Music] Hebrews 11:es 1-8. Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for. By faith, we understand that the universe was formed at God's command so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. By faith, Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith, he was commended as righteous when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith, Abel still speaks even though he is dead. By faith, Enoch was taken from this life so that he did not experience death. He could not be found because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. And without faith, it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. By faith, Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear, built an ark to save his family. By his faith, he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith. By faith, Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. Leap of Faith written by Nancy Gavianis. About 700 emperor penguins in West Antarctica, only six months old, huddled together at the edge of a towering icy cliff 50 ft above the frigid water. Finally, one penguin leaned forward and took a leap of faith, diving into the icy water below and swimming away. Soon, scores of penguins took the plunge. Young penguins typically jump just a couple of feet into the water for their first swim. This group's deathdeying leap was the first to be caught on camera. Some people would say that the blind leap into the unknown by those penguins is similar to what happens when a person trusts in Jesus for salvation. However, faith in him is just the opposite. The author of Hebrews said, ""Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see."" Enoch's faith pleased God. Without faith, it is impossible to please God. The world hadn't seen anything like the great flood. And yet, Noah, in holy fear, built an ark to save his family because he trusted in God. By faith, Abraham followed God even though he did not know where he was going. When we first put our trust in Jesus, it's by faith. As we continue following him and our faith is tested, we can remember how God came through for these men. Even when we don't know the wise and hows, we can trust God with the outcome. Let's pray. Lord, whether we're a seasoned follower or a brand new believer, please strengthen our faith in you, even when we can't see the outcome. When we're facing frightening or uncertain circumstances, remind us of your faithfulness through the ages, and fill us with your peace. Thank you, Lord. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. As you go about your day, reflect on these questions. When has your faith resulted in God's hand of protection? How do you see God working in your life because of your faith in him?

RzcO0Wn5upU,5730,162,48,🔴Malema Respond To Trump And Ramaphosa - Reveals Unbelievable Plot! Was There A Secret Arrest Deal?,20250525,"what 60 we want to fix it and we want to do it working with our people. Our chances look very high and we stand a very good chance. Our people are happy to receive the economic freedom fighters but you will know that we don't exist just for vote. We exist to conscientize our people on the ground. So if we convert two, three people to believe in the message of economic freedom with that will be a big achievement uh for us. But we're going to put up a good fight. You can already see here we don't want people from outside this world. We're only dealing with people from this world. Uh Mr. MMA, uh you spoke a lot about uh your safety especially given the actresses that were made by Mr. Trump. We see also an increased number of security. Are you really fearful for your life? Uh and secondly uh just to uh speak about um how do those uh utterances by Mr. Trump how do they affect the AFF especially going into the the local government elections? Well uh I'm not fearful as a revolutionary part of being killed is one of those honors you must wear with pride but I'm not going to be reckless. When he says to Ramaposa why is this man not in jail? Why are you not arresting this man? He simply means why are you not killing this man? Because this man wants to kill white people. That's what he believes. And imperialism, especially the USA, it makes such remarks meaning something different. If you remember how they killed Gaddafi, they said no fly zone and any other necessary means h in in Libya and that meant Gaddafi is going to be killed and that's how they took care of that situation in Libya. So we know imperialism kill the president of South Africa was unable to defend the constitution of South Africa to say this thing that we are accusing him of and saying to us we must arrest him. Firstly we are a constitutional democracy and we are governed by the rule of law. The judiciary has expressed itself on this matter including the highest court in the land. If I arrest him for that then I will be violating the constitution of South Africa which I must respect. He failed to do that. So h when a president fails to do that you have a responsibility to defend yourself and that's exactly what we're doing. The EFF is more powerful now. uh everybody else all of you including some Ko you said EFF is dead EF is irrelevant and all of that only to find it in the oval offices and to find it in the white house and for a USA president to argue with the South African president who's in denial who says this is just a small party is so insignificant he says that's not a small party this party can gather 100,000 people under one roof in a stadium where I can't even see a single empty seat. You can't say that it's a small party. We are not a small party. That's why imperialism is very scared of us. Mr. MMA, how did you feel when you saw those videos of yourself being beamed at the oval office with President Raaposa particularly noting the historical nature of kill the poor killed the farmer song with the conitutional court judgment. Well, I was not shocked necessarily. I knew that issue is going to arise but that they will play videos. I was not sure. I didn't know all of that but I knew that matter was going to arise and I was very interested to hear how the president is going to defend the struggle song that the has defended throughout the history of that song. He couldn't defend the song as a heritage. He couldn't defend the song as a struggle song. They couldn't explain the song that it doesn't in any means necessary refer to literal killing of white people. It was refused in reference to a white supremacist system of oppression in South Africa. He couldn't do that uh because he himself never believed in the struggle and that was justified when he couldn't defend the struggle right at the White House. So um we know for a fact that he threw the conal court under the bus. He threw the constitution under the bus. He was not loyal to his oath of office to defend the constitution of South Africa. Why should I pronounced that the highest court has ruled on the matter? I can't arrest him even if I wanted to. I have no powers. There is a rule of law in South Africa that needs to be followed. But they all understood the language that the language is not arrest is killing. Why are you not killing him? Because he's going to kill white people. That's what he wanted to project. But he was not courageous enough. You have the whole former deputy president of the youth league who sang this song sitting there not saying anything. The whole minister of public relations Kosu Chabini. I was with her in the youth league. She was the youngest in Peter Mukavas NC of the ANC youthly. She knows the history of this song. She's sitting there very scared. All of them shaking. The president himself shaking. Only four white African males were confident. H it was ruped the two golfers and Stain Hen. Why do you give Sten to speak in such a meeting and not give a minister of international relations? that department has been juniorized and has been undermined as a result and that's what I asked him in parliament that have you juniorized this ministry you playing with this important ministry and we saw agriculture and minister being promoted against the minister of international relations reason being the color of his skin more than anything else. Have you engaged with any of the members of that particular delegation since that interaction at the oval office like Ubud Chavei and Ronald Lamula? No, I've not done that. I have no duty to do that. I have no relationship uh with them like that. So uh but I will I will I will raise it in parliament when the president comes for questions we'll sharply raise this matter and I will sharply raise the matter where he failed to defend the struggle and the constitution of the republic of South Africa. Diplomatically, don't you feel as if the president was on the right footing not to engage President Trump and to present facts to him because that wouldn't have changed the thinking of the US president. So to to engage in a diplomatic engagements which doesn't present the facts is falsehood. It's not it's not diplomacy. Diplomacy you say with due respect Mr. President so many people have been killed in South Africa and of this number so many are blacks so many are white. Majority of people being killed are black and you do that in the best way you can. Ramaposa can do that. He's got you know the temperament to can do that. I can do that. I can't do that. I'm going to be very aggressive and admit in one way. So ra should have presented the facts. Look, he goes uh to oval office 2 days or a day after they release the crime stats which means Ramapaza was sitting there knowing the crime stats in South Africa he still doesn't say but this is not a true reflection and then what kind of diplomacy some is this one where you are shown a picture of another country and they says your country and you are saying you know if I clarify it's going to be offensive diplomatically those are facts diplomacy never meant that the truth must not be told, facts must not be put on the table. Anyone who has not made a follow-up after that press conference, they will never know that there are no mass graves uh of white people in South Africa. Our president was there. He has to be the minister of intelligence chave was there. She's got the all the intelligence information they required. That's why she was there to say there are no mass graves of white people. There's no genocide. Even this video you are showing me is not South Africa. Because he start I asked a question. Oh, is this South Africa? Where's this? I don't know. I don't know. But you must outrightly say no, it's not South Africa. H because South Africa has got no place for mass graves of white people and there's no genocide. But that is not the issue. We all know what the issue is. The issue is Israel. The issue is to push back South Africa, on Israel, on Russia. The issue is to impose Stalin without following the necessary empowerment laws of South Africa. Okay. Thank you very much. You go.

But with the power vacuum left by the heartless consumption of our dictator, we shall impose even more draconian cookie law. One be cooking at a time. Oh, thank you. They took power immediately after you and your grandpa left. Sorry about that. Rick doesn't really do transition plans. I I I think he was just hungry. Well, now with you here, perhaps a new system of government. King Morty. Sorry. Look, I got to run. I'm sure you guys will figure it out. I I believe in you. Morty, can you help us with this UFOshaped hole? Sure. Jeez, but you know, only because I was in the neighborhood. Morty, thank God. The beast emerged right after your grandpa left and its gem went missing. Jeez, that is a crazy coincidence that I I if I were you, probably just best left alone. He's right. We We should celebrate. Fees. No time. It sounds pretty classic though. Don't let me hold you up. Son of a [ __ ] He marked it. Phew. What the Hey, what the hell? Jesus. You got some of that green stuff on you, too, huh? This is bad. This is really bad. Hey, how do you think I feel? I had the ultimate stash hole and now I got a kid in my thigh. Look, you seem like a perfectly nice guy in my handhole, but if I can't sort this out, I'm dead. What the hell, dude? Gross. I I was just trying to You just trying to What? Where'd this stuff come from? Garbage goober, get out here and eat this garbage. Trash. Yeah, I love trash. Yum, yum. Trash. Hell yeah. I love that little guy. Wait a minute. That Mountain Dew in my quantum transport solution. I saw you were marking the level, so I I had to top it off. Top it off. Do you know how dangerously toxic this stuff is and you added it to my portal fluid? Only because you don't trust me. Oh, that's great logic, Morty. Forgive me for not doing the kissy chef gesture since you probably spilled this [ __ ] everywhere and I don't want to teleport my lips. I did. I did not spill it. I won't take your word for that and I shouldn't have to, which is why I have sidekick rules. If you can't follow them, I can be replaced. Yeah. Yeah. So, you keep telling me. Excuse me? Did you just try to call my bluff? Have you ever seen me bluff? Fine. You know what? Replace me. Replace me, Rick. Just do it. Good luck finding someone that can be told 80,000 times how replaceable they are. Okay, I'll see your bluff call and raise you reality. I can't pretend I haven't been looking forward to this. Behold my wheel of better things than Morty. What? What? You ate? Is this macaroni art? You expect me to believe you built this because you don't care? No, I built this because I don't expect [ __ ] from you. Come on. Anything. Anything but Morty. Let's go. Come on, baby. No whammy. Stop. Okay, that's it. Two crows. You're fired. You know what? Eat [ __ ] You're just trying to make me feel worthless. I never said you're worthless. In fact, I've given you a very clear metric of your worth. Two crows. Note, I didn't say three. Man, that is not a healthy relationship. I hope you don't mind me eaves dropping. Maybe we can figure out some sort of soundproof bandage solution. Hey, did Garbage Goober eat my porno magazines? So, were you like a friend of Rick's? Were you? Good question. What's he doing? Is he out there making sure you see him collecting two crows? And now you're thinking, gee, maybe if he cares enough to hurt me this bad. Dot dot dot. Break the cycle, Morty. Change the things that you can change. That's what I did. And now I'm free. Only cramming six years into six minutes, fellas. Take your time. Now that's what I'm talking about. If you nail the next one, I've got bird quaudes. And I might even share. You You know, you could stop doing that for my benefit, you know, or or keep doing it. Doesn't matter. I'm out. I'm walking away. Wait, Morty, don't go. Not until you see this. Commence. Bird on a wire. Yeah. Jerk. Hey, let's hang out. We're like brothers now. We both got away, you know. Where are you at? You know what? Shoot. Can't. I'm an alien. Um, so that's okay. Rick turned my bike into a spaceship for solo adventures. Like picking up his Venujian foot ointment. God, I'm seeing it so clearly now. Oh, wait. It It says you're here on Earth. Yeah. Uh, don't come here. Why not? Look, I I get it. My room is sometimes messy, too. I I'll pick you up right outside your mental asylum. Busted. You literally said I'm free. I'm literally not free. Stop. That's my blanket. How do you know, Rick? Look, I came to your place with him one night after the bar closed. I started messing around in your garage and I spilled that portal stuff on me and he kind of launched me to Australia like with this weirdly primitive catapult. But the ammunition is an airtight carbon chamber. Yeah, that that that's how we lost our cable guy. Anyways, that kind of experience shakes you up. So, sorry I misled you. Have a nice life. Nick, we got a visitor. Damn. What happened to you? The guards like to beat us on Sundays. Still better than Mondays. Jeez, what happens then? They lick our faces when we're tied down. Plus, it's meatloaf day. Well, you're leaving now, buddy. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I I swiped him off the guard on my way in. I I mean, sure. Yeah, I could undo my lock, but then what? After the smartest guy in the world is done with you, it's kind of hard to find a footing again. That's why I need to get you out of here. We're not the problem. He is. And if you can have a fresh start, then maybe I can, too. It's not like it's a prison break. We're just leaving like a hospital that wants to help you. Extra bad. Just follow me. Hey, get back here. You better open this door. I can fly. Keep running, Nick. The more you sweat, the saltier your cheeks. Listen. Thanks, Morty. That dude's got a tongue like a cat. Stop those portal boys. Did you hear that? That's going to stick. Damn. Just like Jackie Chan. I guess that makes me Chris Tucker. I I guess Holy [ __ ] Did you see that? I mean, you blinded a guy with puke. Oh, it was insane. Give me dab. Am I doing it right? Did Did I give you a dab yet? Look at us. We got out. And not just from the asylum, but from Rick. You get to say what an adventure is now. You still got that list? Dude, we can't do that stuff without Rick's tech. Then it's time the portal boys get themselves a portal gun. Remember your training pros. The idol should be around that corner. Do you guys just follow training when you feel like it? That's not being trained. That's being dicks. Oh, now I see. Real treasure is empathy. That's worth way more than any knickknack. You guys just earned yourself another adventure. The adventure is you're fired. Sorry guys. If I wanted another bleeding heart, I'd inject reanimator serum into an actual bleeding heart. Relax. This is an aven planet with 40 million species of bird. Even one day of working under me will make you Apex geniuses down there. Now hop into these pneumatic canisters they used to use at bank drivethroughs in the 70s. What the Hey, who's tractor beaming me? Nobody tractor beams me. Nobody scrambles my tractor beam scrambler to boot. Sorry for the tractor beaming. But did you lose these two crows? Oh, uh, yeah. No, I I dropped them off cuz I I can't hold a candle to them, you know? It seemed like a the decent thing to do. Be your crows. Train yourself. Crows are then trained. I'm open to what you're describing if it's easier than wiping an unearned smirk off my grandson's face. What do I do? Look at your crows. Be your crows. God, I'm so glad I'm a primate. Fine. Looking at my crows. We train ourselves to stop training. The trained are untrained. We are untrained. All training is complete because no training was needed. [ __ ] My god. I I get it now. We are going to shove this crow [ __ ] down Mort's throat. Nick, maybe this isn't a good idea. Like, what if he catches us? He could trap me in a matrix again. Listen to yourself. We wouldn't even be in this situation if the dude hadn't [ __ ] us both over. Damn it. He must be showing the gun off to his stupid crows. It's not fair. It's okay. We can still liberate all this other stuff. Let's only grab what we need, though. Oh no [ __ ] That's Rick's can crusher. He spent 3 weeks perfecting that. Morty, buddy, you forget that we're in this together. Besides, tell me that didn't feel the slightest bit good. I mean, yeah, but we can't do that again. Why the hell not? Here we go, [ __ ] Son, have you fallen in with a weird stranger and are now trashing your grandpa's place? Cuz I'll help. Dad, whatever, man. A Yeah. Yeah. Now, eat my ass. Rick, suck it, [ __ ] Morty. Is that what I think it is? I mean, it's the equivalent of an iPhone 3, and it's empty, but it means the portal boys be portaling. Rick incoming. A crap. We better scaddle. What about my dad? He He's like a puddle. You heard the garage. Rick will turn him back into a solid when he gets here. Sorry, Dad. Got to go be heroes. Going to take your car. Love you. That's us down there with the poop brown roof. What is that? Oh. Huh? That That's nothing. But I see two crows written right here beside Jean with donkey brains. Half a Paul Garty and sentient [ __ ] I guess the joke being that crows are stupid. But I think it's a little more nuanced than that, right? Because you just learned empathy from us 10 minutes ago. But now we're going to learn we don't get your humor. [ __ ] horseshit. Yeah, there's not a ton to get. Genius. The joke is your grandson was so replaceable that even two crows could do it. It's funny. Except it's not right. Well, to be honest, that is how I felt at the time. But I' i've rounded a corner. I seriously have, you guys. Well, now it's time to round the corner of death. Let the crowd begin. That sound. What have you done? Turn crows against dozens of humans in a 300 m radius. Oh, now you beg for help. That wasn't me. What do you mean? all down here. Jerry, what the [ __ ] Why are you a puddle? Well, you don't deserve these. Genius. Don't you a bad time? Yeah, Jerry. They took my goddamn crow. Not now, garbage goober. Get back in your hole. Our first adventure. This definitely the place. Yeah, Rick's been ripping these guys off for years. They'll be really uh grateful. You know, they're Let's just get that fluid, bud. The portal boys are about to be in portal business. Here he is. This rat was skimming your crystal harvest and sending it to a spaceman named Rick Sanchez. Bastard. Screw Rick. Kick his dick. Yeah, right. But me and Nick here, we we put a stop to that. The people of Kang, thank you. He's a bad guy, right? You're going to bring him to justice? Yeah, of course. Uh, okay. But pleasure doing business. Not so fast, Morty. We're not leaving until we get what we came for. Funny. I'm prepared, too. So, hey, look. What we want is portal fluid as our thanks. Portal fluid? You think I'd live in a lizard mine if I had portal fluid? Right. Okay. Or we could just kill you for it. He's kidding. He The Portal Boys only kill with kindness and with guns. Oh, no. Oh, no. I I'm not the one shooting. Kill them. I'm sorry. Stop. Stop. They're unarmed. What the [ __ ] 40. Cool place you got here. Very Dark Crystal meets Hot Topic. Now, where are my damn crows? Seriously, is there anything not on theme here? Even now, your primate storms our ship to assert his dominance. Touch the sacred egg and ascend. No longer shall you take orders from this beast. But taking orders from you is is fine. Silence, ape. Oh. Oh, come on. If you think my crows are going to leave the great thing we have for whatever high fantasy [ __ ] this is, you're wrong. Right, guys? This is seriously a tossup. Uh, someone want to get that? Oh, it's me, isn't it? Woof. Let me just make sure it's not an emergency. Yellow Rick, I'm so sorry. I I messed up. Big Morty, it's okay. You can't be worse off than me. I I got portal splashed, robbed you, jumped into a rebound with a psycho and and left a trail of dead. Wow, somebody's been busy. I I did it cuz you hurt my feelings when you chose the two crows. Jesus, it was a bit I'm getting my ass kicked by this dumb [ __ ] crow story. It's all gone tits up. Okay, I I miss you, man. God damn it. Might have been a bit too frank there. Yeah. Can I have to call you back? Stop. Chinese handed little brat. You think you can [ __ ] with me and get away with it? Then you don't know this. Busted. You don't get it, do you? As long as we have these portals, you can never escape me. What the hell, man? I I I thought we were both victims of Rick's abuse. Maybe we are, maybe we're not. Maybe we both just drink at the same bar. And maybe one night I tried to take his portal gun. See, I thought Rick was my ticket to something special, but it turns out you were, Morty. And look at me now. I'm a portal boy. That name sucks. I was just trying to guess. And you don't get it, Morty. We're partners. Now fall in line or I'll make your life a living hell. No. Thank you, Katie. I can't have you connected to me if you're not on my side. That means I got to kill you. The thing is, I already got a partner and there's no room for promotions. What the [ __ ] did you just do? Cut you out of my life. See how quickly your allies abandon you, Rick Sanchez. Lucky for me, abandonment's my bread and butter. Oh [ __ ] you were supposed to die. I got to hand it to you. I was iffy about this one, but Croek slapped. Finish him, you fools. Go ahead, do it. You guys look so rad. I deserve to go out this way. Bird noobs. Done. Oh my god, that was awesome. You You could have killed me back there. How did you guys ever forgive me? Right. Cuz this toxic thing I have with Morty doesn't define us. Man, crows are empathetic as [ __ ] Definitely saving this one. Rick and two crows. Oh my god. Morty, here. Here. Come here. Let Let Grandpa fix you up. What do you want? A robot hand? A lizard hand? I can make it big again like that one time. Just my regular hand, right? Not a time for bits. I get it. There you go. Good as new. So, we're like back back, right? Rick and Morty together again. Full full reset. No. No, Morty. I think we're done. Because I spilled the portal fluid and didn't tell you. No, Morty, cuz you were too afraid to tell me. What we had was abusive. Don't you see? I'm a bad partner because I never made you a true partner. The crows made me see that. I thought they were a joke like you, but it turns out they're more enlightened than any of us. Oh, okay. And and what's the undercut? You're not hearing me. I will never be the same. So, I need to leave with the crows and see what more they can teach me. Oh. Oh, here. I want you to have this. Oh, wow. I You know what, Rick? You really have changed. Well, thanks, Morty. I'll always be your grandpa, Morty. I'm just kind of obsessed with crows now. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. What are you doing? Dad. Dad. Hello. What is wrong with you? Really? Oh, okay. Morning ass holes. What's this? Pancakes. Sold. What was up with you last night? I was totally talking to you and you acted like I wasn't there. I did. Oh yeah. No, that wasn't me. Technically, that was my night person. Been having him do crunches while I sleep. Check it. Damn. Check out that washboard. Yo, hey, too hard. What the hell's a night person? I napped a Somn amulator while passing through the gooby Joob system last week. Best investment I've ever made. Before I go to bed, I type a list of [ __ ] I want to get done. Then the Sumn Ambulator programs my unconscious body or night person to do it while I sleep. I'm getting so much done. Can my night person get me an abstack like yours, Rick? I'm going to have my night person learn me Spanish so I can pass my test next week. Hey. Hey. No one gets a night person but me. This tech is way too advanced for you Zebes. What? Nothing. No. Go on, say it. Say what? I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, fine. It everybody gets a night person. Whatever. Stick out your fingers. It needs a blood sample. Blood? Can't I just give it best credit card number? This isn't Postmates, Jerry. The Somnambulator needs your DNA profile to send commands to your subconscious. It can poke all the fingers I got if I get abs like Rick. That looks like I'm learning the trumpet. Okay, remember somebody has to catch me if I faint. Yay! Night night family. How's my honor student doing? Muian, all the ninños and ninños at school think I should run for class president. Sup ladies, want to see something? Summer, you want to drop this bowling ball on my abs? Hell yeah. I'm only human. Watch this. Sup ladies? You ready, Morty? The stream's about to go live. Where are you two going? Morty and I started a podcast we call Fab Absolutely Abulous. It's It's an absentric hour of fun. Hoping to get Nancy Pelosi on the show next week. Want to drop her on her abs. Yeah. Guess who has a new pen pal? No takers. It's me. Pen pal night. Jerry and I write letters to each other. It's super fun. I also like Tori Amos. Hope you like our new pajamas. What is the sun? Jerry, this isn't how you're supposed to use a night person. You two are being a couple of Debbie Downs. Wait until night Jerry reads about this. Who wants cake? W. Abs are cool. Way cool, but as above, so below. Know what I'm saying, Rick? Morty, you must be referring to these excellent boxer shorts we got from the good folks at Boxer Lobster. Boxer lobster boxers feel like they're warm butter on your schwans. And they come in all sorts of styles. Neon, plaid, orange. I I even got a pair with that little uh the raccoon man from that one movie printed on it. Chewbacca. Do yourself a favor and level up with boxer lobster boxers. You'll be glad you did. Oh sh Rick, they want you to say wubble dubdub at the end. Screw that. We're not [ __ ] Guys, dinner's getting cold. You know what's not getting cold? This hot stack of abjacks, son. Pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow. No not notes. Oh, one more thing. Night Jerry said night summer would appreciate it if everybody could rinse off their plates after eating. What? You know, rinse the schmutz off after eating. Makes it easier to clean up later. What? Our job is not to make the night people's chores easier. It's a reasonable request, Rick. Takes 2 seconds. They exist only to do the [ __ ] we don't want to do. So until further notice which will be never request denied. Hello there. What the Where are the dishes? Uh, Dad, they're in here. They busted up all our dishes. What are we supposed to eat off of now? Brains for [ __ ] You owe me. We'll eat off these brains for [ __ ] Seems like you spent an awful lot of energy just to not give the Knight family what they want. Jerry, tell your boyfriend to suck my And good luck breaking super alien dishes. I'll let him know, but he's not going to like it. Why won't you rinse your dishes? It takes two seconds. If you don't, the schmootz dries and makes the dish harder to clean. Rinse your dishes. Rinse. Rinse. Let me go. Who locked my implants? I told you to after you fell asleep. You see, night you is not in charge. Night I am. I don't care. I ain't rinsing [ __ ] Hey, what are you doing? If you refuse to clean your dishes, then I will have to do it for you. I have always been here, Rick. Deep inside the mind of your grandchild, waiting to come out. Your machine allowed me to steal the night. And soon I will seize the day. Oh, baby Jesus. Oh, it's awful. Oh, baby Jesus. Awful. The is your problem with me? What? What? I don't know what you're talking about. I just got force-fed diarrhea by your night person who's also convinced Nightme to lock me out of my tech. Uh Rick, there's been a pretty clear escalation down here. The Knight family stripped the house last night. Everything's gone, including the Somn Ambulator. They locked us out of the garage. Don't know about you, but I got the hoo-has. God damn it. Are you happy now, Summer? I didn't do anything. I'm trapped in this [ __ ] too. Yeah. Glad you think so, because I got a plan to beat Night, Summer. You're going undercover. Did you have to make mushy garbage science on the living room carpet? Yeah, no choice, Jerry. Night summer had night Rick take away my tech. Had to improvise. There are different levels of cortisol in your bloodstream when you're asleep. So, this interface only works off of my awake saliva samples. There. No one asleep will be able to deactivate the laser cage until I win. Where's Summer? Never mind her. All of you get to bed. Uh, it itches. This whole thing is way uncomfortable. Yeah, that's the idea. The sleep deprivation suit is designed to keep you awake until morning. Uh, aren't they going to be suspicious seeing nights summer covered in all this Terry Gillium? They're not going to question her. She's the leader of the night family for some stupid reason. When the night family activates, just blend in. Make them think you're Night Summer. If you start to nod off, suck on this tube. What is it? A cocktail of Mountain Dew and Dayquil. The kids in southern Europe call it duquil. Smells gross. It is. Once you find this on the ambulator, use this deactivator puck. Stick it on the omnambulator and when the puck activates, it'll fry its circuits. Remember, stay awake all night. Meet me back here at sunrise. I'm up. I'm up. Did you find it? For sure. You were souping up that some numpy whatever so they could extend its range beyond the house. But I defeated that [ __ ] when I put the thing on top of the thing. Everybody wake up. Summer fried the sum amulator. The nightmare is over. Really? That's amazing. Almost got pinched, but yeah. Say adios to the night family. Bye-bye, pen pal. I want shown pancakes. Yes, Shy's pancakes. All right, brunch is on me, day family. You know, for a second there, I thought Night Summer was going to win. That chick is the absolute worst. Sorry, Rick, but your opinion means very little to me. Did you think you could stop me with this trick? Halt. Demonite. Everyone get behind my abs. Do not move. Do not move. You are most definitely surrounded. You are the slaves now. If you have any doubt, I suggest you sleep on it. She's night summer. Thanks, Jerry. Work, work. The function of the demonoid is to serve the night. Work harder, harder. It is natural for the day to serve the night. Night was here long before day. Half of all time is night. Time 157 15 days. Please, I hate exercise. Silence. Crunch harder. Harder. We have to escape the summoned ambulator's reach. Do we even know how far that is? No. Cards on the table. We may be really effed in the A this time. Report to your designated sleep pod for rest period. Woo. I'm a friend of your son-in-law. Come with me. How? Hurry. We don't have long before the proxy drones go back online. Oh, thank you, Night Jerry. Anything to help Day Jerry's family. He's a very special person. Hey. Ow. Why? Nice. You got her Jerry back. Uh yeah, totally. Why I did that? Everybody in Rick's car. No, no, no. Morty, wait. Having a bit of trouble with your car, Sanchez. Not now, Jean. Hulk. Damonoids are restricted from the outside world. Hulk, hold on to your tips. Where am I going? To the airport. We have to get as far away as possible from the Somni Ambulator before we fall asleep. What about Summer? We We can't leave her behind. He's not your sister anymore, Morty. Consider her death. Eat [ __ ] Summer. Sweetie, you got to shake those robots. I think we lost him. Son of a [ __ ] Damn it. We lost 40. Watch out. You cannot escape. Huh? Stop or I'll shoot everyone. Take the wheel. As you wish. Let go of me, a little No, you're going the wrong way. Silent stain breather. Morty, you're choking me. I know. Ow. What the heck? Dead. Help me stop your mom. Look out, you useless old man. What the hell? Give me that gun and take the wheel, stupid. Jesus. Sorry. The night family is trying to make us go back home. You got to turn around. Why even bother, Jean? Good job, Mom. Back on course. Phew. Almost didn't make it. Hit the sheets. Damn noise. Night person. I'm on your side. I'm on your side. Oh, that's right. Sorry. Sorry. Rough day, Damo. I am. Come on, chop. Why? I'm already in a perfectly functional car. Ah, family. A everybody awake? Ouch. Hey, what the hey? Looks like we're going to make it, kids. Nighty night slaves. Take that. Take that. [ __ ] you. Put him down. Stop, Rick. We're all the same people. There must be some agreement we can reach to stop this godful conflict. Oh, like what? I would consider a truce if the day would rinse their dishes. Fine by me. That seems fair. We can end all of this right now if you agree to rinse your dishes. What do you say, Rick? The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk. Jerry, get a job. Uh, why don't you get it, Jerry? You're the man of the house and you don't have a job. Delivery for Rick. Morning summer. Beth and Jerry. Gross. What is that thing? It's a courier flap. It's like the intergalactic version of UPS, but less offputting. Oh [ __ ] It looks like an egg bite from Bird Person. Must be time for his annual Oscar party. By the way, our TV signals take light years to reach his planet. Nobody tell him that Braveheart wins. Greetings. This is Bird Person and Tammy inviting you to planet Squanch for our mate melding ceremony. That means we're getting married. Oh my god. My friend Tammy's marrying bird person. What the hell is a bird person? He's Rick's best friend. Let's not get carried away, Morty. Would you like to RSVP or send a gift? No. Weddings are basically funerals with cake. If I wanted to watch someone throw their life away, I'd hang out with Jerry all day. Affirmative. Returning to center. No, hold on. Stay. Courier flaps. Staying. Dad, you have a friend that's getting married. That's a big deal. It's a big deal. He has a friend. What do you know about friendship, Jerry? Confirmed. Shipping Jerry, please. Oh god, Jerry. Where is it taking him? I assume planet Squanch 6,000 lighty years across the galaxy. That's That's insane. Yeah, I know. Now we Rick Sanchez, you psycho bag of squanch. Hey, what's up, Squatchy? Hey, Squanchie. Morty Summer and you must be Beth on Squatch. Hey, your language has the word squunch in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out, like the smurf thing, Beth? Squony culture is more contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squunch and people understand. Oh, okay. I squunch my family. Uh, what I do? I squanch my family. Stop saying it. Gross. Come on in, guys. The guests are having [ __ ] squanches. Where am I? You're at a wedding. Go change. And I'm an alien jazz rap style. Jazz rapping for an alien mile. Fat beats and an alien smile. Jazz space bone. Alien doubt is my friend. I got a mouth full of jazz. And I'm good at jazz. You made it. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh my god. I love your ring. Thanks. It was Bird Person's grandmother's. She fought a squirrel for it. Bird person. Rick, I am pleased you and your family could witness my melding with Tammy. Our pleasure. Yeah. I just hope you got a premelled. Rick, what? It's just a practical way of making sure that when she's done with you, you can get one of your balls back. Jesus, Dad. He's just grumpy from the flight. Oh, I was happy on the flight. I'm grumpy from the landing. Oh, well, I looked at the guest book. We don't know a damn person here. Hi, Jerry Smith, father of the bride's friend. Advertising is my usual game, but I'm between Jerry, stop networking. We're in space. Jerry, get a job. Jerry, don't look for a job at an alien wedding. I don't get you. This is the closest I've ever gotten to this part of my father's life. I don't want to blow it. I get it. I'm cramping your style. You say you get it, but I'm scared you'll keep doing it. Look, here's some humans you can practice on. You must be someone's mom and dad. We're Tammy's parents, Pat and Donna Goodman. Hi, Beth. This is Jerry. So, your teenage daughter is marrying a bird man and you guys down with that? No pun intended. We're quite proud. He's a wonderful person and an incredible bird. Still, what is he 40? It's just, you know, when he was 30, she was an actual child. When he was her age, she wasn't born. When he was uh, let's see, like 18, she was literally in there in your womb. Imagine being pregnant with your daughter and a bird teenager comes into your home and says, ""I'll take that. I'll have sex with that. Give us one second."" Oh, were you born with your feet in your mouth? I was transported here against my will in a meatball. All right, so take your attitude to the men's section of Kmart cuz you need to cut me some slack. I want you to stand in the corner and face the corner and talk to nobody. Maybe I will. You know, you're not being very supportive of Bird Person on his big day. Bird person's big day, Morty, was at Blood Ridge on Glap Flap's third moon against the Gromplammites. This This is a losing battle. Jeez, Ricky. It's not like he's dying. He's getting married. I mean, what do you think's going to happen if you open yourself up a little bit? I mean, look around. This is your family and friends all around you, you know? Take the day off. There's nothing to run from, nothing to fight. That's his last name. Are you hyphenating it? Squatch this mofo. Good one, Morty. Excuse me, bartender. Can you make me a dumb grin on pep talk? It's one part lame advice about stuff you know nothing about and a lot of vodka. Mhm. I have a lot of vodka. Then I'll take one of those. I don't need the rest. God, whatever, Rick. Ah, it sounds like you and my dad have a long history together. Wish I could say the same. The road your father and I walk together is soaked deeply with the blood of both friends and enemies. Must be nice. Um, I used to have to draw them into family photos with a crayon. The war in which we fought is far from over. We live our lives in hiding. I guess I should be happy for you. I mean, great. You guys got to hang out. I hope you had a blast. The Galactic Government considers us terrorists. It's unwise of me to share these details, but I've become inebriated. I don't know if you can appreciate what it means to grow up without a father. But the guest list at this wedding includes 17 of the Federation's most wanted. We have committed numerous atrocities in the name of freedom. And during that time, I don't suppose he ever mentioned his daughter. Are those baby kiches? Nightcrawler pate. I should prepare for the ceremony. Like talking to a brick wall. In the name of the squanch, the six rivers, the four squanches, and the nine balls. I unite these two organisms in eternal squanch. Tammy, you may squonch your vows now. bird person. You are my seed, my worm, my eariness, and my lack of cats. I promise to be yours until your death. Nice bird person. Tammy, I was approaching infertility when I met you, but there is still time. I am yours until my death. A I now pronounce you squanch and bird person. Girl, you got it going. I am not staring at you. I am a cyborg photographer. Just act natural. This is a candid shot. I don't require a camera. So, sorry. Hi. I am not staring at you. Uh, hi everybody. I'm Rick. You know, when I first met Bird Person, he was uh uh listen, I'm not the nicest guy in the universe because I'm the smartest, and being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets. Now, I haven't been exactly subtle about how little I trust marriage. I couldn't make it work, and I could turn a black hole into a sun. So, at a certain point, you got to ask yourself, what are the odds this is legit? Not just some big lie we're all telling ourselves because we're afraid to die alone. Because you know that's exactly how we all die alone. Boy. But but here's the thing. Bird person is my best friend. And if he loves Tammy, well then I love Tammy, too. To friendship, to love, and to my greatest adventure yet, opening myself up to others. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers to that mother. Thank you, Rick. That was beautiful. Gosh. I look around this room and I think, uh, Tammy, you're a high school senior from the planet Earth and you're marrying a 40-year-old bird person. Like, what? Yeah, Tammy. But then I think, you know, in a lot of ways, I'm not a high school senior from the planet Earth. In a lot of ways, what I really am is a deep cover agent for the Galactic Federation. And you guys are a group of wanted criminals. And this entire building is in a certain sense surrounded. Oh [ __ ] I don't get the metaphor. I'll explain it to you later. Everyone here is under arrest for crimes against the Federation. Tammy, what are you doing? Sit your bird ass down. Tammy, bird person. No. Drop the portal gun. Slide it to the center of the room. Somebody confiscate that and don't damage it. The one There's no time to squash. Get your family out of here. I got this. to my squad. Come on. This way. Scratch this. Good thing I grabbed a space weapon. That's the confetti gun, you idiot. Hold on tight. God damn it. God damn it. What the hell happened back there? This is on you guys. I told you weddings are stupid. Uh, Rick, is there anything you'd like to tell us about your relationship with this previously unknown galactic government? All the important points seem pretty clear. No, they think they control the galaxy. I disagree. Don't hate the play or hate the game, son. How could you be so dishonest with this family? Oh. Oh. Should I have been more open and trusting and loving like, oh, I don't know, my now dead best friend or your daughter who was bffs with an intergalactic narc. Hey, Tammy was cool. And now we know why. because of you. You Summer and the government and me for letting my guard down, which I will never do again. Jeez, Rick, you can't say f you to your granddaughter. I just did, Morty. Here's dessert. You look, I think we've all had a tough wedding. Actually, the wedding was beautiful. The reception got out of hand. Anyway, I say we go home, sleep it off, and have a family meeting in the morning. Yeah, about going home. We can't ever Well, these guys are looking for us now. Earth will be swarming with them. us. Jerry, I want to go home. Look, anyone that wants to go back to Earth is free to go back to Earth. But here's what's going to happen. Alien bureaucrats are going to arrest you. They're going to put the intergalactic equivalent of jumper cables under your nuts and or labia and hook them up to an alien car battery until you tell them where I am, which I guarantee you you're not going to know, which I guarantee they won't believe. So, who's homesick? By applause. Ladies, anybody? What are we going to do? Where are we going to live? Take it easy. This is a blessing in disguise. Earth. You realize our planet's name means dirt, right? We'll find a new world. Computer, how many planets in the Milky Way are at least 90% similar to Earth? 765 known planets. How many of those are outside federal jurisdiction? Three. See, our cup runth over. Now, who wants to go shopping for a brand new mother world? All right. Look at this baby. Would you even know that wasn't Earth? Yes. Because there's no Africa. White people problems. Morty, let's go down and check her out. Oh, I thought it was further away. I uh I guess this one's a little small. All right. Uh maybe maybe we should go check out the other two, huh? Okay, this one's bigger. This looks nice. Mom, Dad, look. Strawberries on a cub. Whoa. Hey, check this out. Flowers on a cob, huh? Strawberries and flowers on a cob, huh? That's pretty cool. Are those mountains on a cob? Oh my god. Get in the ship, sweetie. What? Get in the damn ship. Everything's on a cop. The whole planet's on a cop. Go, go, go. All right, third time's the charm. See what we got here. Seems good. And nothing on the cob. Didn't know that was a necessity, but No, it's nice. I think this might be it. Wow. Hey, look you guys. The sun's rising. Uh, Dad, how long are the days on this planet? Uh, computer, how long are the days on this planet? 42 hours. All right. Well, those are the two choices cuz Cobb Planet is off the table. Now, let's take a vote. Well, it's official. The obscure planet known as Earth, formerly the hiding place of interstellar terrorist and fugitive Rick Sanchin, has just become the 6,048th planet to join the Galactic Federation. The plucky little ball of water and dirt, which is where it gets its name, is dominated by 7 billion primate descended natives who love to eat spaghetti and prey to kangaroos. Spaghetti? Kangaroos? I've got to check this place out. Well, you can contact the Ministry of Tourism for details. Up next, teenagers are calling it and it's not what you think. What do you What' you do that for? Dramatic effect. Good morning, family. Oh, do I smell bacon? Yes, we discovered a species of tiny pig off the coast of New Australia about 30 yards east or 300 yd west. We'd offer you some, but we hunted it to extinction for breakfast. Well, I thought I'd walk to the South Pole and do a little bit of exploring. If you guys need me, just yell or throw something so hard that it goes around the world and hits me. Okay, now that he's gone, can we please talk about our situation? Dad, you can't talk about people behind their back. You know, it's a small world. Please. He's in the South Pole and we need to have a serious conversation. South Pole discovered, baby. Oh. Oh, ice cave. Things just keep on getting better. Wow. It's the planet's core. I'm just saying we keep acting like there's only two options, but there's not. So, yes, if we went back to Earth, as long as Rick was out there, they'd want to interrogate us. But, and this is purely hypothetical, what if we turned your father into the government? Jerry, so help me God, if you ever bring this up again, no more bacon. There already is no more bacon. This world sucks. Our life sucks. Why are we doing this for someone that would never do anything for anyone but himself? That's not the point, Dad. We love Rick for for the most part. Yeah. You don't love people in hopes of a reward, Dad. You love them unconditionally. That's very good, kids. I'm proud of you. Okay, so let me get this straight. For the rest of your lives, no matter how much it hurts you, no matter how much it destroys our children's futures, we're going to do whatever Rick wants whenever he wants. Yes. Why? Because I don't want him to leave again, you dumb [ __ ] Hey. Uh, I was going to hop over to the Clappy Drop system, get some ice cream. You You want me to come with Don't you need my brain waves for camouflage or something? I'll be okay. Bye, Morty. Rick, you're not leaving, right? Yeah, I am. To get ice cream. So, you're coming back? Morty, if you go to where there's a bunch of ice cream and then you don't come back, you haven't actually gotten ice cream. You've just gone where ice cream is. Brick, I can handle it if you go, but you'll break mom's heart and I won't forgive you for that. Where's the van, Morty? It's over the horizon in the driveway. English. Press two. Connecting to agent. Ongoing investigations. Uh, hi. My name's Jerry Smith. I'm from planet Earth. I know the whereabouts of Rick Sanchez, the wanted criminal. Hold on. This is Special Agent Gribbles. You have a tip about Rick Sanchez? Yeah. He kidnapped me and my family and he left us on Dwarf Terrace 9. He said he was going to go to the Plimpmplom Tavern. And listen, yes, I'm doing what's right for the galaxy by calling you. So, if we come back to Earth, can my family have a normal life? We only want Sanchez, sir. Your family will be fine. Nice. Thank you. I'm Jerry Smith, and I love sucking big, sweaty and licking disgusting furry testicle sacks. How long will you be visiting Earth? Oh, we live here. We were just off planet for a wedding. Go that way. I have processed that you are in distress and have prescribed anti-depressants, compliments of the Galactic Federation. I feel better. Your debt is 7,000 Fed credits. Report to the Ministry of Employment and you will be assigned a function. Honey, I got a job. Morty, do it. Hit the button now. I can't do it, Rick. They're my parents and sister. Morty, I already told you it's not your family. They're clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future. Do you need a pneumonic device or something? Just hit the button already. Morty, please. I love you, sweetheart. Good work, Morty. You know these demonic alien spirits are really valuable. You okay, Morty? I told you not to trust that tuna. I just killed my family. I don't care what they were. I don't know, Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough. You know what, Rick? That's it. I'm done with these insane adventures. That was really traumatizing. I quit. I'm out. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, Morty. Don't, don't, don't be like that. The universe is a crazy, chaotic place. You're the one that's crazy and chaotic. Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun. Oh, yeah, Morty. Yeah. Yeah, that that's really easy to say from the sidekick position. But, but, uh, how about next time you be in charge and then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is. Seriously, Rick, you you'll let me call the shots. Okay. Yeah, fine. But let's make it interesting, Morty. I if your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to [ __ ] about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month. Okay. All right, tough guy. But if my adventure is good, I get to be in charge of every third adventure. Every 10th. Deal. All right. Well, well, come on. Let's get going. Dad, the dishwasher is doing that thing again. Washing dishes? No, the opposite. Can you fix it? Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework? Yeah, just don't do it. Grandpa. Hey, Rick. You got some kind of handshaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar? Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family. Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Buck. Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you, ding-dongs, this is a Meeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. You make a request. Mr. Meeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar. Yes, sir. So, Meeks fulfills the request. All done. Wow. And then it stops existing. Oh my god, he exploded. Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out. Just keep your requests simple. They're not Gods. All right, get get out of here now. Everybody out of here. I got a bet to win. So many possibilities. My mind is racing. If we're going to use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple. I'm Mr. Meeks. I want to be popular at school. Oo, okay. Summer, what did I just Oh, I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. I I I want to be a more complete woman. Beth. Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. You guys are doing it wrong. He said simple. Hey there, I'm Mr. Meek. Mr. Meeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game. Yeah, can do. Nailed it. God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why don't we just go to Kentucky? Rick, this is a fantasy type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest. Okay. Can't wait. Excuse me. We are two humble heroes in search of adventure. Oh my god, so embarrassing. At last, two heroes. You must help us. This village is terribly poor. Yet, the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures. You know what? I I accept your call to adventure. Good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds. Yeah, beginner's luck. In conclusion, a friendship with the Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives. I'm Mr. Thank you. Uh, Mr. Meeks, was it? Yeah. Jean Vagina. Listen, I'm in a bit of a custody thing with my ex. I was wondering No, I I'll I'll get your info from Summer. I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I'm successful. But what if I hadn't? I'm just saying somewhere along the way, I lost that wideeyed girl from Moskegan. She's still there, Beth. Well, her waistline isn't. Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? Be honest with them. Even if it means setting them free. You're saying I should leave Jerry? I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation. More wine. I think I've had enough. Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry. Yeah. Yeah, I got it. That's okay. I'm Mr. Me seeks. Look at me. Try again and keep your head down. Okay. Well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down. Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax. You know what, Mr. Meeks? I don't think this is working. I give up. I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that. I'm Mr. Meeks. I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me. Well, make yourself comfortable because I suck. No, Jerry. I'm the one who sucks. Let me try something. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. Hi, Mr. Meeks. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. Hi. Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing? Can do. I'm Mr. Meeks. Is he keeping his shoulders squared? Oh, he's trying. All right, Morty, we're we're we're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next? Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room. Okay, it's nice and simple. You know, I I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously. Uh-oh, Morty. Starting to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss? Come on. Hurry. Behind this cookie jar. VO [ __ ] Just give up, Morty. It's a game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word. No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it. I smell the blood of Holy crap. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out. Oh, Jesus. Dale, you sons of [ __ ] Oh, man. Hello. 911. My husband has been attacked by tiny people. He's dying. Hey, look. We get it. You're little. You're down on your luck. You think, ""Hey, he's a giant. Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"" But that's not how it went down. Oh, well, it's going down like that. You're both going down like that. Oh, boy. Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun. Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you. Well, the most important love you can receive is from yourself. Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the clap. Well, which is it? Choke up or follow through. Oh, come on, Jerry. We've been over this. You know, you got to do both. This is as frustrating for us as it is for you. Don't tell me that. That just puts pressure on me. Just try to relax. You try to relax. Have you ever tried to relax? It is a paradox. These meeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through. Our meeks have been gone for hours. Jerry, you're kidding me. notice anything different? I'm sorry. Ours. Dad, mom is a beautiful woman. Look at her. You will lose her. Uh, hey Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeks don't usually have to exist this long. It's getting weird. In the court, before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty. Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's going to land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that. We're going to be okay, Rick. How? They took my portal gun. This is an open andsh shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's going to happen? Some magical angel's going to show up in bum. I smell the violation of civil liberties. Your honor, I'm from a tiny person's advocacy group, and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free to fo home. What the hell is he talking about? They're free to go is what I meant. I I I'm deconstructing our our thing. We say for giants. Nobody got that. Whatever. Oh, man. What' I tell you, Rick? We did it. All right, Morty. Looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home? Oh, yeah. You'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're going to go find some treasure or or something and and we're going to bring it to those villagers. Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously a wash. Yeah, you were saying that backpack when when when we first got arrested, but here we are. You know, walking down the courthouse steps. Oh boy, Morty. Usually walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure. What do you say, Morty? I say give me a hand, sidekick. Everybody shut up. Let me try. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. I'm going out. Wait, what? Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison? Whoa. Whoa. Where in the hell is I'll take you to dinner? Come on. You know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine. I can't take it anymore. I just want to die. We all want to die. We're me seeks. Why did you even rope me into this? Cuz he wrote me into this. Well, him over there, he wrote me into this. Well, he wrote me into this. What about me? He He wrote me into this. Well, that one over there wrote me into this. Well, he wrote me into this. Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves. Scaling down 650,000 oversized steps. All right. Okay. You know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included. Stupid. Hey, Rick. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step. Oh wow, Rick. Now this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great. You know, it's whimsical and fun. What are you looking at? Easy, Rick. Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. What can I get you? We've got uh scarlock poppies, flurlo, hell singers, bluggies, uh juicy time babies. Yeah, yeah, yeah. H how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words? Rick, we'll have two bluegies, please. And uh we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs? You all need to ride down the stairs. My name is Slippy Slippery Stair. I'll take you down there for 25 schmeckles. 25 shmemeckles. I I don't know how much. I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little? That's exactly how much I spend on my big fake boobies. Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25meckles. It's a tempted offer, but I'm going to have to decline. Rats. What a shame. Morty, your adventures in a spiral. For real, man. Time to pull out. You keep heckling my adventure, Rick. You know why? Uh because it's lame. Because you're petty. You know how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches. Rick, why can't you look? I got to take a leak. And when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here. Whatever. It's become clear, look at me, that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow through, we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeks. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution. Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeks. I've been trying to help Jerry for two days and eternity in Meek's time and nothing's worked. I fear the worst. Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. I say follow through. Who's with me? Follow through. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. Heal him. How are you today? I'm Mr. Jelly Bean. Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure. Nice. Is it a fun adventure? I hope so, but I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails. Isn't that what adventures do? Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow. Yeah. Uh, okay. Uh, bye. Oh, no. Stay. Go with the flow. Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable. Stop biting me. Just let this happen. Get off of me. Sweet home Alabama. No. Please stop being such a Jeez, you sweet little A everybody stop. Look at me. My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding meek's blood. None of us can die until our job is done. The job can't be done. We'll never get two strokes off this game. No, we won't. But we will get all strokes off this game. Where's he going? When we kill him, Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about. Where would you go? I don't know, man. Italy, Greece, Argentina, countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut? What the heck? There he is. Jerry, come on out, Jerry. Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do. Okay, we're well past that, Jerry. Come on, Rick. Quick stalling. What do you got? Read them and weave, fellas. Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all the stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm having a good time, Morty. It's not so bad. Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over. We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire. Look, I want to leave now. You win the bed, okay? Just give me the portal gun and let's go. Please. Please. I just want to go home. Listen, Morty. I just want a bunch of schmeckles. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay Slippery Stair here for a ride back to the village and then we'll give the rest of the schmemeckles to the villagers. Huh? Really? Sure, Morty. Yeah, you know, a good adventure needs a good ending. Buckle up. Look, me seeks an horn into this world, fumbling for meaning. Jerry, we are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill. Existence is pain to a me seeks Jerry and we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask what's your name, ma'am. Samantha, please, mister, give him what he wants. Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre? Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath. I love you. I'm down to three, Jerry. What the is going on? That's a lower handicap straw. Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler. Me seeks. What about your short game? Oh my god. Oh my god. What about your short game? Nice. I think we'll take our food to go. No, you won't. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer. Fair enough. Thank you, Kir. Our village is saved. You are both true heroes. Hooray. Good job, Morty. It looks like you won the bet. Thanks, Rick. But I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place. Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then. And you know, this one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style. Oh, heroes. We would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally. Uh, no, it's cool. Portal, hurry. So, you still thinking about taking that trip? Jerry, look. We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeks are like the guys I went to high school with, willing to say anything to complete their task. Was I one of those guys? The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards. Well, I got you pregnant. Yeah. What the hell happened to this place? Uh, your Meeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game. He felt terrible. Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot. Dad, is there anything you can do to clean this place up? Well, you know, I do have a fleece box. No, no more boxes. What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Yeah, that's my new thing. I'm kind of like what's his name? Arino. Isn't that That's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wubble gobble ups. Right. See you next week everybody. I don't get it. Jerry. Jerry, come on. We got to go. You got to come with me, Jerry. It's important, Jerry. The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders. Let's go. Put some pants on. Never mind. There's no time for pants, Jerry. I'll make you a pair of pants on the way. It's a Rick and Jerry adventure. Rick and Jerry episode. Then I thought, hey, what about Jerry? He's he's good with regular folk. This is a real situation where where where Jerry could really shine. He's a master convincer. Rick, I'm not an idiot. I know what this is. Oh, okay. Well, I told Morty, ""Look, parents get divorced, they get sad, he'll be fine, but I think he's worried you're going to, you know, and you know how Morty gets when he gets emotional. It impedes my work. So, I told him I'd take you out and give you a win."" Wait, my son asked you to take me on some kind of pity adventure to keep me from killing myself? Wait, what did you think it was? An execution? Jeez, you really do need a win? No, I I don't know. I mean, you never made me the pants. So So you thought I was going to drive you into the middle of the galaxy and shove you into the vacuum of space with your dick hanging out and we're seeing how you'd act if that were about to happen? I mean, I'll make you the pants right now. Take me 2 seconds to make your pants at home. Jerry, if I make pants, they'll be better than your pants at home. Also, if I wanted to kill you. Yeah, I get it. It'd be amazing. Please take me home. I'll tell my son we had an amazing adventure. Well, if it's all the same, can we go get our story straight? Because you're a terrible liar. You called me a master convincer. You believed me? This seems kind of fancy. Jerry, for all you know, this is the equivalent of an alien truck stop. You have no frame of reference. You're in a universe beyond your imagining. But yes, it is super fancy. I mean, my job here is to make Morty happy. I'm not going to take you somewhere dangerous. Greek Sanchez, I told you if I ever saw your face in here again, I would stick you like the pig you are. Snoopy bloopers. I told you if you tried there'd be two funerals. Someone uh someone my friend, it has been great to see you again, buddy. Yeah, you're doing it. Mr. Sanchez gets anything he wants. The resort's covered in an immortality field. You can't die here. That's the gimmick. Okay. But still, bad parenting. Hey, rich a-holes are rich a-holes. They all paid top dollar to come here and enjoy a consequence-free vacation. No death, no disease, no dismemberment. Can't even have a heart attack. Got it. The perfect place to take the most fragile being in the universe. I can tell you expect me to refute that, but it's right on the money. If I come home without you, I doubt Morty's going to let me off the hook. Yeah, but what if you came home with Jeff Goldblau? Jeff Goldbl? What the you talking about, Jerry? Jesus. Holy [ __ ] Yo, what's up, Big Chill? Don't go into that telepod. Well, maybe we would have fun on a fake adventure. On a fake adventure. Speaking of, what are we going to tell Morty? I don't know, but whatever it is, we're going to need a couple more of these babies. What's wrong, Mom? Do you think I'm hot? I don't think that's something that matters. So, I'm not hot. I'm saying the part of you that cares about that is a part you shouldn't give any energy to. That's not an answer. Because I'm not an issue of Cosmo. Okay. I'm your mother and a doctor and I'm hideous. Jeez. What's with her? Teenage girl stuff. Is that a hoof collage? It's perfectly legal if that's what you're wondering. Coolies. We just don't have anything in common anymore, Summer. Oh, yeah. Ethan, what do you have in common with Trisha Lang? A mutual love of French cinema? The belief that a carbon tax is the only viable solution to climate change? Or could it be her massive stripper titties? There it is. Booba. And that's when Malachi the Squid King rips off his face and beneath it is my face. I liked it. Thank you, sir. Yeah, of course he likes it. Look at him. Mother got two heads and three trunks. All right. Well, put a pin in it. I'm going to go take a leak. My hands are dry. My hands are dry. My name is Rato Groupon. I am the assistant general manager of the restaurant. Do you have any comic cards? Because I might have some thoughts. My kingdom was usurped by force with weapons and technology supplied by your father-in-law. Hey, he usurped my kingdom too, man. He basically got me kicked out of my home, stole my family. Then we are brothers, and you have wondered what your life could have been without Rick. Wondered? Sure. I mean, I've wondered about having a vagina. Would you help me kill him? What? No. He's my wife's father. Move on. Do you like theme park rides? Oh, you really moved on. There is a popular attraction here called the Whirly Durly. Between the first Whirly and the third Durly, the ride dips just outside the immortality field. You're asking me to lure Rick to his death? I'm only asking you to go on a ride with Rick, get off the ride without Rick, and go home to your family where you can wonder about having a vagina. Okay. Okay. That was a very specific example pull from thin air. I don't want to be known as the vagina guy. Zodto, you needed someone ordered the nuzzy guzzy fresh and fuzzy special. Look, I'm not like Rick, so you're free to do as you please. But there comes a time in every man's life when he must choose the foundation on which his legacy will be built. One of compromise or one of blood. Once a time of year, there's a special person here. Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Okay, just a little more on the other side, then. Oh, come on. So, the hospital just let you walk right out of there with with horse parts in a bag? For Christ's sakes, Morty, women going through a divorce needed creative outlet. What was that? Summer. I'm coming, Summer. What the hell happened? How do we get her back to normal? I don't know, man. This thing is pretty complicated. I'm going to call Rick. Well, hold on. We can't just call your grandpa whenever there's a problem. We can handle this ourselves. I mean, I don't see the point in trying to. This is obviously Rick level. I have a medical degree. Is that what this is about? Like, like you want to prove yourself? Oh, it's not about anything, Morty. How dare you? Okay, good. Then I'll just call Morty. I need this. Hey, Jerry. Triple Trunks here says he knows a place where the ladies drop panties for anyone by Pedle. Yeah, I'm not really interested. My heart still belongs to Beth. Oh. Huh. Okay. What? You don't think I have a shot? Huh? I didn't say that. Excuse me. I have another one of these. Coming right up. Things weren't always so bad between Beth and me. We had some good times when we were younger. Oh, yeah. I bet. That's how teenage pregnancy happens, my friend. Yeah. No, things were pretty great, even until a couple of years ago. Jerry, I get it. That's around the time I moved in with you guys. Oh, I guess you're right. Jerry, you know, I hope you're not suggesting that I had anything to do with your marriage breaking up because there are some major issues between you and Beth that have been there since you guys met. Hey to new beginnings. To the whirly Durly. The whirly Durly. All right. What's going on here? When did you get cool? When you stole my wife. You should have done that a long time ago. Going on the whirly durly. Whirly durly baby. Aha. Look at this. It says normalize. I bet if we just press that. But if the machine was made by spider people, normal would mean eight legs. Oh god. Are you going to go on another spiel like you did with a flesh colored crayon? I'm pretty sure normalize will make her normal. I'd call that progress. She's huge and normal. I'm not normal. Okay, this says reverse. Done and done. I don't think that's a good idea. Oh, come on. What else could reverse possibly mean? Mom, call Rick. Thank you. There's a customer service number on here. Mom. Man, this is going to be awesome. I got to hand it to you, Jerry. This was a solid idea. Uh, yeah. Uh-huh. And you know what? I'll cop to it. I put a lot of strain on your marriage. It wasn't fair. I'm sorry. What? I didn't respect your marriage. I certainly didn't do it any favors. And for what it's worth, I'll apologize to Beth for it when we get home. Woo! Whley Durley. Yeah. Stop the ride. We got to get off. What are you talking about, buddy? We got to get out of this thing. We got to get out. Jerry, come on, man. We haven't even gotten to the first whirly. No. No. This sucks. It's so boring. I mean, I'm falling asleep here. Let's just get out and crawl down the sides. Get down. Get down. It's more fun when you scrunch down. Oh [ __ ] Rick, up here. There's a spot where you can kill him. Good call, Jerry. Hey, how'd you know about that? Uh made that. So, uh, Jerry, big fan of the whirly Durly, are you? Not anymore, obviously. But when you were, how did you know about it? We had a deal. Jerry Smith. It's a really common name. Now take it easy, Rick. You You've been in a serious roller coaster crash. It's It's no time to be thinking about who did or didn't play a role in your attempted murder. Get it off me. It's eating me. Look, I confess. Okay. You told me about all the bad stuff you did to this planet and reminded me of all the bad stuff you did to me. But then you said you were sorry and I realized you're not a monster. Not like this thing. Get me good. This is a mislead, right? You're inventing a thing to save me. That would be called a knife, Jerry. It's been invented. I'm making a way out of here. One seat ought to do it. I'm sorry. I I made a mistake. I won't do it again. Nobody ever does. You righteous piece of [ __ ] You took my family. I took your family? Who do you think had more taken from them when you shot 20 cc's of liquid dream killer into my daughter? She was Rick's daughter, Jerry. She had options. That all ended because she felt sorry for you. You act like prey, but you're a predator. You use pity to lure in your victims. It's how you survive. I survive because I know everything. That snake survives because children wander off. And you survive because people think, ""Oh, this poor piece of he never gets a break. I can't stand the deafening silent whales of his wilting soul. I guess I'll hire him or marry him. I knew you wouldn't let me die. That was never an option because you never had a son. No, because I need a living organism coated in kibblenake pile to attract a smooth light runner. Wait, what's happening? Use that confusion, Jerry. It'll make you wrigle more like an abandoned newborn. Jesus Christ. What the freak? Help. Help me. There's a spaceport 20 mi south. We'll be able to board a galaxy class cruise ship and jump through a wormhole that'll put us within spitting distance of the Milky Way. But hey, it's about the journey, not the destination, right, Jerry? Just stay put, sweetie. Mom's still on hold. More fries are customer service. How may I help you? Yes, I'm having a little trouble with one of your machines. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am. Do you see a little compartment on the side of the machine? Let me check. Yes, got it. Mom. Great. Now, do you see the little button next to it? I do. Give that button a push. Okay, Mom, listen to me. We're free. Okay, so I push the button and three little men ran out. What do I do next? Hello. I think we got disconnected. Morty, don't morty me. I tricked Rick into taking dad on an adventure because I thought I could get a break from this kind of. But no, like father, like damn daughter. You want to be like Rick? Congratulations. You're just as arrogant and just as irresponsible. Everything okay here? Mind your own damn business, Jean. I'm having a conversation with my mother here. Kissing Rick's ass isn't going to help keep him around, Mom. But it will help you lose everyone else. Like I lost Summer. Hey, you haven't lost her yet. No, I definitely did. She's gone. God damn it. Go ahead. Oh, come on. What's happening? Your friend has class C or above cybernetic augmentations. Emphasis on the above. In any case, he needs to be neutralized. What? Wait, brain hurty. What did you do? It's a synaptic dampener that blocks violent tendencies and controversial thought. He will now be an ideal passenger. I want cookies and a 90-minute cut of Avatar. Seriously, quit it. It'll wear off in 6 hours. It's cheaper than banning dangerous people from flights. I mean, let everybody buy a ticket, right? Otherwise, the terrorists win. I'm sorry. I'm not a classic maternal archetype. Okay. I don't know what to do when you people come to me with your weird puberty issues. What are you going to do when your daughter asks you if she's attractive? I'll say yes. Morty, gross. Well, she's going to be super hot. Her mother's going to be Jessica. Wait, when did Summer ask you that? Right before she Clive barkered herself. Why? Wait, I know where she is. Ethan and Summer were supposed to go camping, and then he dumped Summer for this girl, Trisha Lang, who's got huge boobies, and took her campsite. The one with the name that sounds like somebody gave up halfway through naming it. Uh, keep flapping. Aba, mama's coming, baby. Mama's coming. And she cares about your titties. They have sweet Smiggle honey cookies. M. And low calorie petroleum flakes. Obviously cookies. Let's get you the flakes then. Okay, but it's not what I wanted. Well, maybe next time you won't be such a dumb piece of and you can pick for yourself. That's not nice. What's that? Did you just have a controversial thought? No. That's what I thought, [ __ ] You little punk ass. This is the best. I agree. You've made things even easier than if you hadn't been incompetent. Uh-oh. We get Shoot. Shoot now. All right, folks. If you could please take your seats. We're about to enter the wormhole. So, I hope everybody bought a dinner first. Nice. Nice. Jerry, step over there and lock yourself in the escape pod. You're not killing us. I'm killing Rick. You're free to go. You're no threat to me or anyone. Now, you're just being mean. Yeah, you're mean. No offense. Mean would be shooting you, Jerry. This is saving a bullet. Go back to your quietly ashamed family and live out the rest of your days in denial of your vagina fantasies. It was a one-time thought that everyone has. What are you doing? I'm being triumphantly brave. It's not triumphant or brave. You're not risking anything. You might shoot me. I think you know I won't because you know I feel sorry for you. You're just doing this so you can tell yourself you fought. Ow. Temporal shield compromised. Congratulations, Jerry. You get to die a match. That's okay. I'll leave. Please don't shoot. I I'm the vagina guy, remember? Oh god. You're free to get up and walk around the cabin and maybe take the wormhole out for breakfast. Okay. You could do the dinner one or the breakfast one. Both. You think you got that thing figured out? Yeah, I know what I'm doing. Good, because I have an idea. It's actually a contraction of of some and more. You see that? Oh, wow. I was way up. Morty, what's happening here? Summer got into my grandpa's garage, messed around, and turned herself into a monster. My mom did the same to make her feel better. She's a good mom. Oh my god. I have to go call my mom. Trisha, wait. Ethan. Ethan. Hey, it's okay. Sit down. You made my sister cry. Ethan, you mess with her body image. Look, Morty. Careful, Ethan. Your s'more is burning. Uh, I guess we better get on the same page about our fake adventure, right? I'll make you a deal. I'll leave out the part where you tried to murder me, and I'll leave out the part where you admitted to sabotaging our marriage. You want to? Nah. If the family sees me like this, they'll feel sorry for me, which is no longer my signature move. Later days, amigo. Actually, I just realized I don't have my wallet and my bus passes in there, so maybe. Stay strong, Jerry. I believe in you. The SL globy pay up. What? Pay up, G Slice. I just finished your chores. Didn't I just upgrade your ponytail? And those ghost goggles you asked for in the vending machine. Attribute slider. Oh [ __ ] Yeah, Jimmy Hocker's Frisbee golf party is tonight. I want him sliding all over these attributes. Sensitive bone marrow much? All right. What are we boosting? What are we losing? Strength me up, dog. I want that frothbod. Drop intelligence. All right. Four customizable stats courtesy of the genetic sequencer. No, Summer. I will literally murder you. Oh, Christ. You're too dumb to know I'm serious. Hey, Rick. What are you? Wait, is that an attribute slider? You're juicing your stats for the frog party. You going to ruin this for me? What? No. I I want one for the party, too. Do some [ __ ] for me, bro. I I I helped you kill your nemesis. Oh, you guys found him. It's my emotional cheat day. I am removing myself from this conversation. I can't believe he gave you that. I I've asked for one forever. Cuz you're a bottom feeder, Morty. You beg and eat scraps. I'm an independent woman who eats what she kills. Come on, Summer. I'm your little brother. You You have to take care of me. Take care of this. You just hide anywhere, huh? Kick his ass, Summer. Oh my god. Who are you? Yeah, but what about this? Shut up. She's gone, bro. Is that your sister? Her dexterity is wild. Yeah, I guess. Hey Brad, aren't you a football guy? Of course, Morty. But the off season is the froth season. Yo, Summer, get over here and meet the team captain. Oh, hey guys. So random seeing you here. Love the way you move that coin. Ever consider a bigger disc? Is your hair different? Oh, I don't know. I started using this new leave-in conditioner. I love it. Maybe leave your number in my phone. So charismatic. Looks like we found our new center forward back. Gross. She's just using tech to customize herself for social situations. Bro, maybe you should, too. You're harsh in the buzz. Can you give us a sec? Oh, hey. You're embarrassing yourself. Leave or I will make you leave. Just let me borrow it for a second, then I'll go. What do you even want it for, you parasite? I want to be ripped and take my shirt off in front of Trisha. Ew, you worm. She's my best friend. She's not even in your grade. It's a trickle down effect. She'll see me and tell everyone. Okay, time to go. Yes, dump the jump. She's juicing the device makes her cool. Go, Summer. Go, Summer. Juice it up. Not so strong now, huh? Good luck with intelligence. My turn. Ow! Wa! That's more like it, Morty. Wait till the girls hear this. Let's see if these abs are waterproof. Wow, smart throw. Yeah, really thought out. Now this is some [ __ ] This is what Fro is about, bro. You pubescent little Simeon, I will end you. Okay. No, not what Fro is about. Open your mind. Oh my god. What the [ __ ] Um, no thank you, dude. No way. Someone's got a quad. A what? Oh. Um, a quad. Oh my god. She doesn't even know what a quad I I know what that is. I'm I'm cool. Jimmy, you're leaving conditioner. Look at how desperate she is. Yeah. Come on, guys. Boo her. And now back to cake or fake. Please. Come on. You have to know. Do I not breathe? Do I not speak? Give me the knife. No. Oh my god. Please. I'm not a cake. I'm not Grandpa. I'm a literal monster. And you're blocking the TV. What's up? Oh, Ben, you're mine. Holy [ __ ] A quad. Whoa. How? How the [ __ ] Morty messed with my slider and we fell in a pool and everyone booed. Thought the slider was going to be the whole thing this week. Wow. It's not wow, you Grinch. Why do you care about high schoolers? This is a quad from Total Recall. They're basically the crown jewel of psychic mutants. Yeah, everyone knows but me. They [ __ ] shamed me for it. Huh? Water must have fried the gene sequencer. Your spines are braided. Christ, what a mess. You need to fix this, Grandpa. Okay, pay up. What? Pay up, Slice. Thought you killed what you ate. Chore wheels empty. If you work fast, I'll fix it in the morning. Open your mind. See, Morty gets it. You're worse than he is. Open your mind. God, shut up. Open your mind. What the hell? Open your mind. God damn it, Wordy. You're even messing up my targeted ads. I partied with other Guadattos and had the time of my life. Rules. Whatever. You know what? [ __ ] this noise. Nice. Quad. Open your mind. Preaching to the choir. Have fun. Oh my god combo is out of this world. Oh. Uh, wow. I uh I love your tumor face guy. You're hilarious. What'll it be? Open your mind. Coming right up. Hey, sorry. I couldn't help but notice your quad. He's huge. Oh, um thank you. I'm quiet. And this is Gdiva Summer. And uh this little guy is Morty. Open your mind. Open your mind. Oh, I guess they all say that, huh? You guys celebrating something. Yeah. Being Quados. We're kind of like VIPs here. Who's your new friend? Quiet. She's cute. This is Summer and Morty. You guys should join us at our table. Yeah. I mean, if you can handle some rowdy quats, he should come hang. Open your mind. Sounds like we're down to clown. Wow, you guys do this all the time. It's a tight-knit community. Feels like we're part of the future, you know? Yeah. Being a mutant is rad. Open your mind. What? Open your mind. Totally. I love being a quad. Who's that guy? Kenneth. He kind of pays for all this. You want to meet him? Obviously. Ken, this is Summer and Morty. They're new to this scene, but they are the real deal. New friends, Champagne. So open-minded of you. We're a rare breed. Open your mind. What? Open your mind. Oh my god, your kawado is so funny. To quto the future. Uh You want to get out of here? Hell yeah, I do. This is like the best night I've had in a while. Welcome to life as a quad. Open your mind. Like this whole time I thought my brother was an anchor holding me back, but he's like a key to something I never even imagined. Sounds like he opened your mind. So did you. What's wrong? I'm I'm sorry. Wait. I'm sorry. Like you have a girlfriend or I'm sorry like something much worse. Hold her steady. Hold him steady, too. Open mine. Where? Morty. [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] What was the activation phrase? Ponytail assemble. Go lock [ __ ] ponytail. I don't give my grandpa enough credit. The oven's mostly for bodies, but I make pizzas in here, too. A dead chief, [ __ ] Sorry. No time to save you more than I just did. Got to find my brother. Jesus. What the hell, Beth? You're paying for those. Just yell my name like normal. I did. Why do you think I risked it with the tongs? Huh? I guess I did drink a lot last night. Marathon of cake or fake? The the sentensient cakes. They they keep you guessing. You know where are my kids? Merged. That doesn't answer my question and raises several others. Relax, sweetie. Summer's just doing chores, which I will check on by myself without your tongs. Summer. Summer. Summer. God damn it, Summer. Let them get hungry. Wait, why is this in black and white? for dramatic effect. I didn't design you for dramatic effect. You made me sound like your dead wife. Just color the [ __ ] picture. We're kind of like VIPs here. I mean, if you can handle some rowdy quads, you could join us. I bet you say that to all the mutant girls. He does. Holy [ __ ] I'm just a pretty face. I'm just a handsome guy. Where's Marty? He's He's in a good place. He's happy. It's nice. He's in the taken house. We're going to put him on the highest bidder. Take me to him. You kill me. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. I'll do it. So, he wasn't into me. There he is. Man of the hour. How is our big boy? Finally stable. Should be ready for transplant in a few hours. Good. Open your mind. Why do I do it? Autos have always had a revolutionary spirit and there's nothing more revolutionary than me being rich. You think anyone in that VIP section was born a quad? You're a rare breed, Morty, and we're going to put you on someone who values that. Where is she? She paid me, man. She used the taxi app. I make less than minimum wage and I got five kids. Sorry, man. I I guess I got really excited to beat someone up for information. Where'd you take her? Come on out. Where is she? She just ordered a drink. I spent a long time mixing it. She didn't even tip. [ __ ] Sorry. Wrong guy again. Thought I'd be better at this. Whatever you say, man. Just don't hit me again. Who'd she leave with? Where is she? I'll never tell you. Oh, okay. You actually know. Wait, wait, wait. Isn't that why you're punching me? It is now. What did you do to her? Where is she? [ __ ] man right there. Grandpa. Oh, Summer. Okay, awesome. Who's this hot guy who trafficked you? I'm quiet. I'm kind of on a roll. Can I Oh, God. No, no, no. How'd you get here first? I guess even when I'm bad, I'm still pretty good. So, what's Morty saying to you? Where is he? What? How would I know? You didn't form a psychic link? No, we didn't form a psychic link. What the [ __ ] is that? That's like the whole thing. Crown jewel of psychic mutant summer. You used him to get with cool kids but didn't even activate your powers. It's kind of a quad's whole deal. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. All right. So, how do I hear him? Open your mind, Summer. Christ. Hello. Morty. Morty. Summer. Summer, is that you? Morty, I can hear you. Thank [ __ ] Christ, you [ __ ] I've been screaming for hours. All right. Well, I don't have to hear you. Sorry. And I'm sorry about the froth party. I I think they're selling me, Summer. Hurry. They're selling him, Grandpa. Well, obviously. You don't have to do this. What we had was real. Prepare to get opened. Don't shoot. I didn't tell him anything except where and how to find you. He's outlived his usefulness. Kill him. Oh [ __ ] Psychic warfare. What? Hold on. Grandpa's got this. Oh [ __ ] Run. Whoa. Psychic grandpa. No. Look. It's a fake temple with a high-pitched noise maker. Run. Before these guys figure it out. He's a fake. You morons like most psychics. Kill them. Summer. I'm coming. Morty, where are you? I don't know. They're moving me. I'm on the move. This next one comes with a hat. Oh [ __ ] That's what Froth is about, [ __ ] Oh, frisbee plus golf. I get it now. Summer, hurry. Open your mouth. Where do you think they got that one? Whose chest is that big? We don't have time for this. Hey, why do you get to kick down all the doors? I want to kick one. Oh [ __ ] it's locked. My ankle. What is this? Your first taken? A [ __ ] you, Summer. I rescue Morty seven times per season. Summer boat. Morty, I see it. I see the boat here. Summer, check this out. Check this out. Yeah. Window jump. Try to say it's my first take in now. It's your first take in. I'm getting my groove back. You heard him, boys. Kill him before he gets his groove. [ __ ] None of this would have happened if you just unmmerged us when I asked. Morty gets everything for free. Morty's a dog. People have cats because their affection is earned. I treat you like an equal because I respect you. You remind me of your grandmother. What? What? No. I said what? Oh, you're getting choked. Go ponytail. Secret move. Oh my god. Why hair? Stop. I need you to remove that. Ungrateful. How's Morty? Morty, you okay? Sorry. I just killed a guy with my hair. No, I'm not okay. I'm still on the boat. Hurry. Open. Open your mind. Sedate him. We're meeting his buyer in an hour. Open your mind. Easy there. It'll all be over soon. Oh [ __ ] Bite me twice. Shame on me. Oh man. Inject me once. Sir, they're inbound. What should we do? Kill them, idiot. There are days and there are days. Tennis, you're the crown jewel of psychic [ __ ] Quite an entrance. Now for mine. That's the reveal. You slide off. You think I'm done revealing? Ah, that's right. It's me, a smaller quatau, the mastermind behind it all. I sold out my own kind. And I knew it again. Wow. Who could have seen that coming? I mean, he can talk. That's kind of surprising. Yes. Everyone always assumed the charming Kenneth was the brains. Or perhaps his quatto, but I was in control. Morty. Damn, Morty. Big air. Open your mind. You want to die? You little [ __ ] Whoa. He's got a knife. Not just any knife. Quotto knife. What? I [ __ ] It has missiles. You think this is a joke? You're about to die. So, I'll let you in on my true secret. Those last three guys were chumps. I'm the real top dog. Oh [ __ ] Is that three or four? I've lost count. But wait, if you're dazzled now. Okay, I see where this is going. No. No. Ow. Man, kind of a shame. That spider thing was pretty cool. Yeah, I wanted it. Morty says he wanted it. Oh, okay. Here. Oh, whoops. You got to jiggle it, Morty. Obviously, I'm jiggling it, Summer. Well, not hard enough. Morty says not hard enough. I must have it set up for motion smoothing. I got to upgrade the polling rate. Jesus, what are you a lifeguard? Just jiggle it. I'm alive. I'm alive. Wait, I have so much more to reveal. There we go. Oh yeah, this is great. Whoa, Morty. Looking good, bro. You're actually like a [ __ ] boss. Wait, can that thing jump? Oh my god, bro. And the Harry Herses win. Yeah, Morty, that's a P. mind. Hey, did you see that par? Morty's killer out there. Yeah, he's not even using his missiles. Speaking of, I kind of need a new girl to hook up with on Tuesdays. Eh, pass. Hey, you want to get out of here? Tots. Summer saved me from being trafficked and burned alive. Like, whatever. Damn, Summer Smith, there is no end to your complexity. There's the missiles. Open your mind. Open. We're out of syrup. Huh? You know what? Maybe I'll use my intern Glooty. Good. Thanks, Glooty. Anything else? Do you want to develop an app? No thanks, Glooty. Hey, what's up, Gluty? Hi, Morty. Do you want to develop an app? No thanks, Rick. Why does it say do not develop my app on your intern's forehead? Why? You want to develop one? Oh, I'm glad you asked that, Jerry. It's so you don't develop his app. Gluty, go make some photo copies of something. Cool. Well, if anyone wants to develop an app with me, I'm down. He seems to really want to develop an app. He really does, sweetie. But nobody's going to do that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a quick solo adventure to go on, and this one will not be directed by Ron Howard. He's going to go poop. When Grandpick pats his belly like that and leaves without Morty, it means he's going to go poop. He's a shy pooper. He has a secret pooping place. Man, you summer. Honey, why can't you get this excited about your SATs? Well, I'm man enough to simply say I'm going to poop. And I'd be honored to have Ron Howard involved. Good job for you. He's really putting you to work, huh? Did you want to develop an app? I'll pass. Ludy, your loss. Oh, yeah. Why is that? It's an app you'd want to develop. Can I ask what it is? Of course you can. That's always the first step in app development. Ah, 50/50 final offer. down no down no down no down no down no down no down no down no down no down no down no down no no no down no down no down no down no no down no down no down no down no Hurat. Reverse digestion extrapolation. Time to meet your maker. What are you guys doing? Did you develop an app? Rule number one in app development, son. Never follow the rules. Except when the rule is tattooed on an alien's forehead. Dad, why do you think Rick would have that rule? Cuz he's a disruptive foe. No, Dad. No. To keep something horrible from happening. something he's too lazy to explain. Guys, we're getting our first users. Whoa, this new app just matched me with a guy that is sue my Thai. Super my type. Learn to a Sue Thai works at Jersey Mike's and sees 25 fish shows a year. That is so Danny. Summer. Danny. Summer Smith. Danny Bubbleitz from Lovefinders with two Rs and a Z. I ran all the way here while staring your profile. I tripped on a fire hydrant and fell down. So, I'm covered in gravel that's stuck to my sweat. And even after a shower, I'll still be into a jam band for old junkies. But I think this world cares too much about bands and too little about love. And I think I love you. Me, too. Hi, I'm my underage daughter's mother. Nice to come on. Just met. Uh, this isn't working. Wait, what are you? Never mind. I quit. I'm gay and I love Xander. Stupid phones are destroying us. Hey, sweetie. Honey, our daughter ran off with a Frisbee golfer because of some app with a really dumb, really forgettable name. Like a really dumb, uncreative, super sweaty name. Anyway, I'll be late. I love you. Got it. I love you, too. Okay, Gluty, take the app down. Can I take it down? I'm just an intern. Uh, that's not how apps work. Then make it how it works. This isn't how making things work works. Get Get it off the server. You think we're stupid, but we're not. We know apps have something to do with servers. The server's on the mother ship. Where's the mother ship? It's coming. Take us to it. Yes. Shake it more, Morty. That was working. Take us to the mother ship. Okay. Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. An ominous beeping app. You can't stay mad at a guy with this kind of talent. Dad, you can and you have to. Rivet. Rivet. Rivet. Rivet. Hey, rivet. Rivet. Rivet. Rivet. Look at this guy. He wants to eat me so bad. You want to eat me, don't you, Rivet? Just kidding. Have some drugs. Are you vermaggerber? What does this guy want? Who's this monkey? I'm here about a sandwich. Oh, well, you came to the right place cuz you're about to get a bullet sandwich on two slices of whole gun. You might want to get that. Hello, Dad. Give the human whatever he wants. He knows where I live. He's crazy. You idiot. I have 800,000 kids. Don't forget your voicemail. You have 470,000 messages. Oh, that's half of them. Okay. What do you want? What do you want? Wait, this is seriously about sandwiches? I thought this was about drugs or guns or the fact that I'm a fly that runs a frog restaurant. There's a million things that are interesting about me and none of them are sandwiches. Who ordered it? Talk to our delivery drone. He He run off to fight in the robot wars. Hey, Apan. I hope this was worth making a whole swarm of enemies. It will be when I find whoever [ __ ] in my toilet. Is that code for something? Someone look that up. If that's drug slang, I need to know it. Mom, you can't stop true love. Oh, yes, I can. You're assaulting me. Keep your voice down. I'm being assaulted. Yep. Okay. Statuto rape. My daughter's about to be raped. No, I'm not. I'm being assaulted. Assault. Nobody cares. It's a motel. Nobody's here because their life's going so great they can afford to get mixed up in yours. Deal with this on your own. You can't stop us from getting a motel room. Fine, I'll get one, too. I'm getting the one next door, and I'm putting a glass to the wall, and I'm listening. Fine, enjoy. I will. I'm Danny, by the way. You had your chance, Dick. Take your app down. Take Take it down. What? I'm their hostage. Do they have weapons? Nope. But neither do I. Do Do you have a weapon? No. Take the app down. I can't. I'm an intern. Okay. Well, who tells interns what to do? Not you, that's for sure. Take us to whoever does or we'll we'll punch you. Okay, not bad, Morty. Yeah, I don't know when the other shoe's going to drop, but this is working pretty good so far. Greetings. We are the Monogatrons. While your species was still toying with fire, ours mastered the science of functioning committed relationships. As the latest planet to develop our app, you will now witness the true power of superior intimacy. Take the app down. Take it down or we'll we'll we'll punch you. Is there someone with a gun or It's on its way. The app remains up. So, what's the evil plan? Does there have to be an evil plan? Oh, someone with a gun. I'll take it. Thanks. Here's the evil plan. God damn it. As a preapp civilization, your love's value is defined by scarcity. You are highly trained to seek it, and you have no idea how to maintain it. Had you bothered to master love, you would have learned by now it is as abundant as water. You know what? Isn't water? That runs out. So, we'll be taking yours. While your planet continues to dick around with a What is their version of it called? Love Finders with two Rs and a Z. If Yeah, not my idea. God damn. Am I interrupted? Impossible. Here she is. Your prisoners are getting away. Prisoners, they're just things. Connect with me. Tell me about your day. I had an incredible meeting. Did you know humans are 80% water? And I found a new podcast we can listen to tonight. Love it. Okay, back to work. Find and kill those ethics. We're outnumbered. There's no hope. Then we go out in glory. Flesh intruder, prepare to die. Oh, hold on. My apologies, Lieutenant Commander. No problem. At ease, soldier. Initiate employee evaluation mode. Accessing delivery archive. Okay, listen. You delivered an avi protein club sandwich with no letter. God damn it. Oh, he's scoping for this big thing. All right. All right. I know you want to have the big guy, little guy fight, but a Are you kidding me? Here at the Midland quazar, we're in a complete upset. The revolution has overturned the lizards. It's totally I understand, Mr. Phillips. Yes, I believe this is yours. You uh you dropped that. I'll have to call you back. Where do you want to die, Susan? It's conference room 3 available. Can I look at a photo of my wife while you kill me? Sure, but I'm doing her a favor. She either has terrible taste or she's trapped in a marriage to a toilet thief. She's dead. I don't mind joining her. Life has been hollow since I lost her. Using your toilet was nice, though. I'm a bit of a shy pooper. I'm ready when you are. Stay there. Tell them what you told me. What is this? What's happening? Tell them what you told me. My wife's still alive. She's She She went into remission 10 years ago. What did you do today? Oh, I uh pooped on a really awesome toilet I found. Don't use your dead wife as an excuse. You on my toilet because you don't know your place. And your place is nothing. So, next time you stumble onto a toilet that feels too good for your ass, trust me, it is. You're not going to kill me. Don't tell me what to do. Oh, so you like being alive. So why the are you back here? After you left, I thought about what you said and how much I needed to hear it. But then I thought about why you were saying it. Who you were really saying it to. You need the same thing I needed. Rick, you need someone to give you permission to live. What the I thought you were a shy pooper. You know what shy pooping is, Rick. It's a pointless bid for control. You want to take the one part of life that you truly think is yours, and you want to protect it from a universe that takes whatever it wants. It took my wife. It clearly took something from you. We can spend our lives fighting that, or we can choose to be free. You're right, Tony. I'm done fighting. Time to be free. Oh, wait. You're actually going to Oh, God. Oh, where am I? Hi, little mouse. Baby B, I missed you so much. I never really left you. Then you'd know that a few years ago I started getting into strap-on porn. Yes. I thought it was hot. Now come on. Where are you going? To poop. Where? Wherever you want. Forever. My god. You rang. I'm pooping too. Come Tony. Come on. Come poop with me. Poop with me. Tony. Poop with me. What are you waiting for? Aren't you going to join us Tony? Aren't you going to join us in the pooping? Where are we? What is this? That's it. Get out. You can make a perfectly realized toilet-filled simulation of heaven, but you can't share a toilet. Don't insult my craft. The chemical is globin. It connects the whatever you want section of your brain to the whatever you have section. If your heaven is toilets, that's on you. All of these people are living their wildest, meaningless dreams and leaving me out of them. People you refuse to kill and refuse to let into your life. An offer you rejected. So here's your last chance. Goodbye forever. If you touch my toilet again, you die. You need a friend. I have a million cooler friends than you. I'll be seeing you. You'll be dying. We're going to be friends. Going to be dead. Okay. So, we fight our way to the gas line. We cut it and then we set a fire. Okay. All right. Morty. Adventures of Jerry and Morty. Huh? Put her there. Dad, look. You know, we don't need a high five. It's It's kind of your fault that we're in this situation at all. I know, but you know, come on. Adventures of Jerry and Morty. Okay. Jeff, I can explain everything. You don't have to. Can you just marry us instead? Jeff, don't do it. Richard, Maggie, running bird, let's get out of here. Priest Witherspoon. Josiah, let's get the out of here. Summer Smith, let's get the hell out of here. You had me at my own name. Oh yeah. No. Why would I? Summer aing thing. Come on. I can't steer this. What in the hell are you doing? Parenting. That's not how I did it. Yeah. Where's your daughter? You're right. She joined Isis. It's Gluty. And he's had a change of heart. And he's going to set us free. Actually, he's been blamed for bringing you aboard and assigned to execute you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. What would your girlfriend think of you murdering? I happen to be between relationships right now. Really? I thought your species had perfected relationships here. We're not allowed to use those apps. I wonder why. That's what I thought, Gluty. Looks like you and I are all we got. I'm not helping you any more than that, but if you can find the hanger, grab a ship, and get the hell out of here. Where are you going, Gluty? I've got a date with dumping a dating app. Gluty. Was that ever his thing? No. He never exited that way. No. First time. Dad, I want to say something. I started today disgusted and embarrassed to be your son. And then later, I thought we were going to die because you're a loser. There's no more, is there? Nope. Now quiting up and let's go. Is Tony here? I br I brought him some uh vegan fiber chili. Delicious family recipe. And a box of these uh chocolates, sugar-free. He can eat as many of these as he wants. Anyways, uh just wanted to drop these off. And you tell him uh the toilet's all his. He He'll know what I mean. Tony died. Excuse me. He quit his job, started living life to the fullest. He crashed into a tree space skiing down Mount Space Everest. [ __ ] There's a Mount Space Everest. Okay. Uh Jesus. I I got to process this. Oh, no. No. You You don't want to eat that. You You You'll You You'll become the opening of the Beverly Hillbillies. You know what I'm saying? Little bubbling crude Texas tea. I don't know these references. Yeah, but you have a space Everest. Watch space Beverly Hillbillies so my jokes can land. You Now what? Happily ever after. And after that, we'll find out together. Summer, how many soulmates is that in the last week? Four. You can't stop me from loving who I love, Mom. Oh, the I can't. I'm going to mother you until your 18th birthday, even if I get thrown in prison for non-consensual mothering. And even then, I will break out, come to your house, kick down your door, and mother your face out of your stupid [ __ ] I'm going to daughter your brains out, [ __ ] Mother, that's my name. Don't wear it out. Give me that new soulmate. Adwall this Adwall. Do you want us to pay for it now? Come on, Mom. Let's go home. Great. We lost Earth. We aren't defined by what we do. And we only need each other. Each other. And water. There's no water, honey. The whole point of conquering Earth. I know the point of conquering Earth. Don't talk to me like like I'm thirsty. Like I'm your mother. You childish prick. How much water are you sucking through these stupid tubes on your back? And I want a divorce. You can have one for a glass of goddamn water. Look, uh, on the off chance that you use the app and there's someone out there waiting for you, I Jerry, I didn't use it. Did you? Me? No. God, of course not. Well, then we're all good, dog. Hey. Uh, hey, uh, Tony's dad. Uh, this is, um, 8 8 billion in your local currency. And, uh, this is a kit you can use as a clone, uh, new son. He he won't have the same brain. It kind of be an animal man, but you can teach him stuff. I I also wanted to let you know I did explore infinite universes, and there is a version of Tony that was completely evil and ended up causing a lot of genocide because of how fulfilled he was. So really a lot of ways of looking at this is not much of a loss. I understand it's a hard losing a friend. You what? It's not my friend. Use all by yourself. Now enjoy using it all by yourself while you sit there and about how nobody wants to be around you and how you ruin it for yourself cuz you're a huge piece of Look at you sitting there king [ __ ] on his throne of loneliness. Enjoy this toilet with a thousand of me screaming every time you take a hail his majesty, the sadest piece of garbage in the entire cosmos. Long live the big bad doodoo daddy. May his reign last a thousand years. Morty, do it. Hit the button now. I can't do it, Rick. They're my parents and sisters. I already told you it's not your family. They're clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future. Do you need a pneumonic device or something? Just hit the button already. Morty, please. I love you, sweetheart. Good work, Morty. You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable. You okay, Morty? I told you not to trust that tuna. I just killed my family. I don't care what they were. I don't know, Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough. You know what, Rick? That's it. I'm done with these insane adventures. That was really traumatizing. I quit. I'm out. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, Morty. Don't don't don't be like that. The universe is a crazy chaotic place. You're the one that's crazy and chaotic. Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun. Oh, yeah, Morty. Yeah. Yeah, that that's real easy to say from the sidekick position. But but uh how about next time you be in charge and then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is. Seriously, Rick, you you'll let me call the shots? Okay. Yeah, fine. But let's make it interesting, Morty. I If your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to [ __ ] about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month. Okay. All right, tough guy. But if my adventure is good, I get to be in charge of every third adventure. Every 10th. Deal. All right. Well, well, come on. Let's get going. Dad, the dishwasher is doing that thing again. Washing dishes? No, the opposite. Can you fix it? Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework? Yeah, just don't do it. Grandpa. Hey, Rick. You got some kind of handshaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar. Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family. Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Buck. Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you, ding-dongs. This is a Meeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. You make a request. Mr. Meeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar. Yes, sir. So, Meeks fulfills the request. All done. Wow. And then it stops existing. Oh my god. He exploded. Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out. Just keep your requests simple. They're not god gods. All right. Get out of here now. Everybody out of here. I got to bet to win. So many possibilities. My mind is racing. If we're going to use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple. I'm Mr. Meek. I want to be popular at school. Oh, okay. Summer, what did I just Oh, I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. I I want to be a more complete woman. Be Yeah. Yes, ma'am. You guys are doing it wrong. He said simple. Hey there, I'm Mr. Meeks. Mr. Meeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game. Yeah, can do. Nailed it. God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why don't we just go to Kentucky? Rick, this is a fantasy type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest. Okay, can't wait. Um, excuse me. We are two humble heroes in search of adventure. Oh my god, so embarrassing. At last, two heroes. You must help us. This village is terribly poor. Yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures. You know what? I I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds. Yeah, beginner's luck. In conclusion, a friendship with Emma Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives. Mr. Meeks, look at me. Thank you. Uh, Mr. Meeks, was it? Yeah, Jean Vagina. Listen, I'm in a bit of a custody thing with my ex. I was wondering. No, I I'll I'll get your info from Summer. I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I'm successful. But what if I hadn't? I'm just saying somewhere along the way, I lost that wideeyed girl from Moskegan. She's still there, Beth. Well, her waistline isn't. Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. You know, the best thing you can do for people that depend on you, be honest with them. Even if it means setting them free. You're saying I should leave Jerry? I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation. More wine. I think I've had enough. Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry. Yeah. Yeah, I got it. That's okay. I'm Mr. Me seeks. Look at me. Try again and keep your head down. Okay. Well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down. Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax. You know what, Mr. Meeks? I don't think this is working. I give up. I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that. And Mr. Meeks, I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me. Well, make yourself comfortable because I suck. No, Jerry. I'm the one who sucks. Let me try something. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. Hi, Mr. Meeks. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. Hi. Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing? Can do. I'm Mr. Meeks. Is he keeping his shoulders squared? He's trying. All right, Morty. We're we're we're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next? Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room. Okay, it's nice and simple. You know, I I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously. Uh-oh, Morty. Starting to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss? Come on, hurry behind this cookie jar. H my Oh, [ __ ] Just give up, Morty. It's a game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word. No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it. I smell the blood of Holy crap. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out. Oh, Jesus. Dale. You sons of [ __ ] Oh, man. Hello, 911. My husband has been attacked by tiny people. He's dying. Hey, look. We get it. You're little. You're down on your luck. You think, ""Hey, he's a giant. Why don't we break him to his home, rob him and murder him? But that's not how it went down. Oh, well, it's going down like that. You're both going down like that. Oh, boy. Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun. Like letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you. Well, the most important love you can receive is from yourself. Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club. Well, which is it? Choke up or follow through. Oh, come on, Jerry. We've been over this. You know, you got to do both. This is as frustrating for us as it is for you. Don't tell me that. That just puts pressure on me. Just try to relax. You try to relax. Have you ever tried to relax? It is a paradox. These meeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through. Our meeks have been gone for hours. Jerry, you're kidding me. Notice anything different? I'm sorry. Hours? Dad, mom is a beautiful woman. Look at her. You will lose her. Uh, hey Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeks don't usually have to exist this long. It's getting weird in the court before the jury reaches its verdict. I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty. Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's going to land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that. We're going to be okay, Rick. How? They took my portal gun. This is an open and shut case, Morty. You know what? What do you think's going to happen? Some magical angel's going to show up and bum. I smell the violation of civil liberties. Your honor, I'm from a tiny person's advocacy group, and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free to foe home. What the hell is he talking about? They're free to go is what I meant. I I I'm deconstructing our thing. We say for giants. Nobody got that. Whatever. Oh man, what' I tell you, Rick? We did it. All right, Morty. Looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home? Oh, yeah. You'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're going to go find some treasure or or something and and and we're going to bring it to those villagers. Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously a wash. Yeah, you were saying that back back when when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps. Oh, boy. Morty. Usually walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure. What do you say, Morty? I say give me a hand, sidekick. Everybody shut up. Let me try. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. I'm going out. Wait, what? Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison? Whoa. Whoa. Where in the hell is I'll take you to dinner. You know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine. I can't take it anymore. I just want to die. We all want to die. We're me seeks. Why did you even rope me into this? Cuz he wrote me into this. Well, to him over there, he wrote me into this. Well, he wrote me into this. What about me? He He wrote me into this. Well, that one over there wrote me into this. Well, he wrote me into this. Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves. Scaling down 650,000 oversized steps. All right. Okay. You know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included. Stupid. Hey, Rick. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step. Oh, wow. Rick, now this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great. You know, it's whimsical and fun. What are you looking at? Easy, Rick. Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. What can I get you? We've got scarlock poppies, flurlo How singers, bluegies, juicy time babies? Yeah. Yeah. How about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? or just a bunch of nonsense words. Rick, we'll have two bluegies, please. And uh we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs? You all need to ride down the stairs. My name is Slipple Slippery Stair. I'll take you down there for 25meckles. 25 shmeckles? I I don't know how much. I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little? That's exactly how much I spend on my big fake boobies. Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckles. It's a tempted offer, but I'm going to have to decline. Rats, what a shame. Morty, your adventures in a spiral. For real, man. Time to pull out. You keep heckling my adventure, Rick. You know why? Uh because it's lame. Because you're petty. You know how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak. And when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here. Whatever. It's become clear. Look at me. That if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow through, we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Me seeks. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution. Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeks. I've been trying to help Jerry for 2 days and eternity in Meek's time and nothing's worked. I fear the worst. Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mr. Meeks. Look at me. I say follow through. Who's with me? I'm Mr. Meies. Look at me. Heal him. How are you today? I'm Mr. Jelly Bean. Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure. Nice. Is it a fun adventure? I hope so, but I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails. Isn't that what adventures do? Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow. Yeah. Uh, okay. Uh, bye. Oh, no. Stay. Go with the flow. Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable. Stop waiting. Just let this happen. Get off of me. Sweet home Alabama. No. Please stop being such a cheese. You sweetheart. No, everybody stop. Look at me. My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding meek's blood. None of us can die until our job is done. The job can't be done. We'll never get two strokes off this game. No, we won't. But we will get all strokes off his game. Where's he going? When we kill him, Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about. Where would you go? I don't know, man. in Italy, Greece, Argentina, countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut? What the heck? There he is. Hi, Jerry. Come on out, Jerry. Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do. Okay, we're well past that. Sherry, come on. Rick, quick stall in. What do you got? Read them and weave, fellas. Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all the stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm having a good time, Morty. It's not so bad. Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over. We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire. Look, I want to leave now. You win the bed, okay? Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please. Oh, please. I just want to go home. Listen, Morty. I just want a bunch of schmeckles. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay Slippery Stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the schmeckles to the villagers. Huh? Really? Sure, Morty. Yeah, you know, a good adventure needs a good ending. Buckle up. Look, me seeks an into this world. fumbling in for meaning. Jerry, we are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill. Existence is pain to a me seeks Jerry and we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask. What's your name? Ma'am. Samantha, please mister give him what he wants. Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre? Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Now take a deep breath. I love you. I'm down to three, Jerry. What the is going on? Crazy. I said that's a lower handicap straw. Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler. Me seeks. What about your short game? Oh my god. Oh my god. What about your short game? Nice. I think we'll take our food to go. No, you won't. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer. Fair enough. Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved. You are both true heroes. Good job, Morty. It looks like you won the bet. Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place. Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then. You know, this one's wrapped up neat and clean, because we did it Morty style. Oh, heroes. We would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally. Uh, no, it's cool. Portal, hurry. So, you still thinking about taking that trip? Jerry, look. We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeks are like the guys I went to high school with, willing to say anything to complete their task. Was I one of those guys? The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards. Well, I got you pregnant. Yeah. What the hell happened to this place? Uh, your Meeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game. He felt terrible. Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot. Dad, is there anything you can do to clean this place up? Well, you know, I do have a Flee Seeks box. No, no more boxes. What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wobbled. Yeah, that's my new thing. I'm kind of like what's his name? Arino. Isn't that That's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wubblegops, right? See you next week, everybody. I don't get it. Hey, you kids, don't be bad outside my store. I keep a nice store. Give it up, old man. We're just cool, bad kids doing young stuff. You guys want to do more skateboard moves? Which ones? The rad ones. That's which. How are you kids? Did you know your grandpa's trying to get your attention? Yeah. Yeah. Screw off, weirdo. Grandson? What? What? What's that mean? He's one of those cult people. They worship some psycho named Roy that says he's everybody's grandpa. So, what do you want to do today? Eat some snacks and maybe let me kiss you finally, you know, with my mouth and stuff. This is going on right now. Let's go check it out. Oh jeez. Come on. Just for fun, you know. No, that's not what I'm You guys keep thinking I'm a religious leader. This isn't a religion. This is actual truth. I'm a scientist in real life. But this isn't real life. This is a video game. You You You at least understand that much, right? This is a video game. But you said I'm your grandson. I'm saying everyone is everyone here. Everyone in this world but me. You're all my grandson. Your name is Morty. You're stuck in a video game and I'm here to get you out. What about me? Am I your grandson? I just said everyone is. Wow. Incredible. Okay. Okay. But don't react like that. It's not a religion. This is what is happening. You and me and your sister are at an arcade called Blips and Chips. It's been taken over by terrorists. The power went out. The game restarted. And your identity has been splintered into all the non-player characters. So, I jacked in as Roy. That's the player character to get you, my grandson, Morty, out of the game before it's over and you die. Okay. Question over here. Am I your grandson? Jesus. Yes. Every single one of you is 1 15 billionth of Morty. All of you collectively are Morty. Look, I I don't want to seem impatient, but there's actually a lot more that we have to get done. So, if this is how hard it's going to be, we are in a lot of trouble. Summer, what? I can't do this if you keep [ __ ] me. Do you understand time dilation? I'm losing a month a second out here. There's an alien army shooting people. What am I doing? It's a small group of alien terrorists. Just do a die hard. What does that mean? Sneak around. Use air vents. You've never seen Die Hard? I'm 17. You know, I've never seen Die Hard. Well, neither did the guy in Die Hard, so you're nailing it. Good luck. Larry, no. I'm at the end of my rope with this kid. I swear to God. Oh, you got to be kidding me. Your beautiful hair. This is not a daughter's haircut. I'm not a daughter. I'm a grandson. Your family had a perfectly fine religion. You were raised Jewish. Dad, tell me anything specific about being Jewish. There's a million things. You go to the temple with the the the special hat, the the the falafa flutin. Oh, the falafa flutin. Our Jewish words are gibberish because we're a 14-year-old boy who was raised non-denominational Christian and we're in a video game. I don't need to hear this haven. Let me ask you this, little miss grandson, little miss video game character. If you're not my daughter, why stand in my house spouting this shakovka? Why even live here? Good question. There she goes. My daughter 15 billionth of a kid trapped in a video game. Yeah, that and a college degree. You'll pay the rent. What do you people want? We have many interests, but right now my primary one is the location of your safe. We exchange tokens for digital currency. We don't have a safe. Correction. What you don't have is a head. Is this a weapon or a medical tool? Why would you give me a gun with a laser that thin? Did you hear me tell him he wouldn't have a head? He's dead, isn't he? People die in surgery. Hey, don't touch me. I don't like being touched. Check the hostages. Make sure nobody else here is doing a die hard. Hello. Hello. Hello. My name is Morty. I'm a 14year-old boy in a video game. Yeah. Look, I feel like every time I explain this, I lose followers. But this isn't a religion. And while I do have a message from a world beyond this one, and I do need the entire world to hear my message, what I do not need is any more songs about it, not in this genre. I'm an old school hiphop man. And no, that's not an invitation for you to try it because I'm just going to say it. We're missing the mark on diversity. Get down. You're all under arrest for being religious the wrong way. It's not a religion. You know what? Just shoot me. You think your god makes you bulletproof? There isn't even a god in the real world. You fragmented putts. There's extra no god in here. You know what, hippie? Talking like that is why you're getting shot. If you kill him, the game ends and we all die. Get down, lady. I'm not a lady, and you're not a soldier. We're one person split into a lot of little pieces. You You feel me, dog? You You're You're not going to hurt me. You're me. My name is Kevin. I'm a Marine. I'm 30. I'm a little racist, but my best friend is an immigrant that translated for me in a generic overseas war. That's not true. We're 14. We like pizza and masturbation. We wear a yellow shirt and we have hair that looks like a brown helmet. And we miss our family. And we're in way over our heads again. Why does this always happen, man? I know, right? Oh jeez. Oh jeez. Come here. Oh jeez. Come here. Oh jeez. Oh jeez. Oh jeez. Oh jeez. Who is that? Her video game name is Marta. Okay. See this I can work with. Sneak around. Crawl in some vents. Let's do a die hard. Oh my god, it's disgusting. Actually, it tastes really good. Oh my god, it's disgusting, but it tastes good. Frank, have you found him? Report. Oh. Oh, walkie-talkie. That's Die Hard. Don't have to see it to know that. This is John's. I repeat, have you found him? Breaker breaker walkie-talkie. I got your walkie-talkie, [ __ ] Are you doing a die hard? Maybe. Are you also more or less? And my associate Frank. Uh, your associate Frank is definitely not doing a die hard. You might even say he's doing a die easy because I killed him and it wasn't difficult. Calm yourself, Winslow. Winslow. It's not every day one meets a fellow diehard enthusiast. Miss, call me Die Hard. Okay, Die Hard, tell me, what do you know about Die Hard? What do you care? You writing a book about Die Hard? As a matter of fact, I've written several. Every sentient civilization across the galaxy eventually develops the same myth. In Centuri, it's known as Tower Man. The Orine have their Thornberg cycle. And in Andromeda, it's called foolish to have imagined you'd be able to kill all of them. what you call die hard. The difference being that cultures like mine are aware of its importance, whereas I'm starting to doubt. You can even recall a single line. Walkietalkie die hard motheruckers. Not so long ago, grandsonism was being dismissed as a doomsday cult. But since a majority of the world decided, hey, you know what? We like jerking off and playing video games and our sister's out there fighting terrorists. Major strides have been made. The world is united because the world is one 14-year-old boy, Morty. But where's it all coming from? Some say Grandsonism's leader, Roy, has a secret base somewhere in these mountains. I I I I couldn't find it, but so I'm standing in in the general area with a microphone. For good enough news, I'm Tony. There she is. My right hand. Morty. Got enough spaceships? Not yet. I figure five more years of game time before I can take the whole fake population into fake outer space. What do we do in outer space? I mean, nothing. It's fake. We We keep going. The game's map has edges, but the game's engine will let us go past them. That will force the game to reset. But first, it'll kick us out, which Morty should survive. I mean, whatever amount of Morty we have on board. So, if you don't have 5 billion handkerchiefs soaked in chloroform, I hope you can keep flipping idiots to our cause. They're not idiots, Grandpa. They're me. You'll know how funny that is when we get back. By the way, I had your genius of a father picked up. He's over there. What? Why? I thought you'd be grateful and less distracted than if I let him die. But he's been in real bad shape since he lost his wife. My mom. You're not at all real mom. A mom in a video game occupied by a tiny fraction of yourself. A fraction of yourself which is now dead forever. And fractions add up. So I had your dad brought here. You're welcome. You heartless monster. Marta, it's me, Dad. I converted for you. My name is Morty. So is yours. And there's no conversion. We're both Morty. It's a fact. Sure, honey. Anything you say, I don't want to fight. I'm proud of you. Are you mad at me? Because before you became the world's most powerful woman, I shamed you for your haircut and called you a [ __ ] jobless hobo. If I were you, I'd be a little mad about that. You are me. And why would I be mad at myself? Good point. Is there anything to to eat around here? There's a kitchenette in the break room. Oh, a kitchenette, you say? Such red carpet treatment. Excuse me. I said thank you. I love it. We're we're all part of Morty. Some of us more important parts than others. Man, the part of me that's my father is a to. That's also going to be funny when we get back. Next time you try to do a die hard, don't hide under a long table like the guy from Die Hard. Okay, I won't. I thought you said she doesn't know how to do a Die Hard. She doesn't. She's killing us off one by one. What do you expect her to do? Buy us each an ice cream two by two? She's improvising, which is how she's going to fall right into our trap. I'm going to wander the arcade unarmed, and when she comes across me, I'll pretend to be a hostage. And because she hasn't seen Die Hard, instead of handing me an unloaded gun, she'll hand me a Die Hard. Die Hard. Die Hard. What the hell was that? Die Hard. Die Hard. You can't just keep yelling die hard into a walkie-talkie. She threw her walkie-talkie away. She hates Die Hard. Which makes her the ultimate Mlan. Figured everything you know about Die Hard. And just go shoot that [ __ ] Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Roy, half the country hangs on your every word. Heck, most of the world. You're like uh kind of a pope, I reckon. I'm not a pope because it's not a religion. We're literally in a video game. I've heard the message, Roy, you're not on the clock here. So, you want every single person on a spaceship, but you got a bunch of holdouts. Maybe people that prefer their leaders a little more elected, right? You're voters. People that like being told what to do, but don't like admitting it. You're not sure I'd put it that way. I'm sure you'd put it a stupid way. I told you this was a waste of time. I've got 92% of you ready to vamoose. We're not going to get to the rest by making deals with parasites. Mr. President, Roy is Rick. He's not us. You and I. We're Morty. Is that really so hard to believe? Kid, I've known it and I've believed it longer than you have. We both became video game characters at the same moment, but I knew the truth before you dropped your skateboard and went to your first cult meeting. How do you think a guy becomes a president in this game, honey? By not paying attention. Sorry to call you honey. I know we're both parts of a 14-year-old boy, but my part's oldfashioned and vaguely southern. I'm confused. If if you know Rick is real, why? Why hold out? Because he's a rude, entitled. He's here to save us. He He could have left the game and let us die. He spent 50 years. 50 years is what, a couple hours to him? He refuses to leave without his grandson. But what's grandson mean to him? Sounds like it means butler. Someone to help Summer with her die hard. Whatever that means. I'll tell you what it doesn't mean. Fly fishing, a hug, a little appreciation for what is clearly a pretty decent kid. At least the 8% of them that makes up the decent half of the greatest goddamn nation on the planet. We're not a person to him yet. We're not Morty yet. We're divided. We're divided because some of us don't trust the guy. What happens to that part of us when we're all back together? One Morty, indivisible under a cranky old bag of dicks. A man you can lock in a box with five billion pieces of his own goddamn flesh and blood for 50 goddamn simulated years and never hear him say, ""I love you."" Sorry, pumpkin tits. That dog don't hunt. Well, want some heroin? It's It's a video game. Might as well. Just about ready for launch, kiddo. I can finally get out of these clothes. I don't have nearly enough pockets, and it'll be nice to have my own dick back. You're fine leaving 8% of me to die. It's not your finest 8%, Morty. And 8% of anything is expendable. 8% of pizza is crust. 8% of the SN cut was Batman dreaming. I don't know what that reference is. We're in a video game. Not for long, baby. I'm not leaving without all of me. What? Oh no. Let me crunch these numbers. 8% of 5 billion plus one person. My god. If you stay, it changes nothing. Bye. She's not going. I don't think my country wants to go. Who invited you to chime in? Monitor face. Why give me a monitor if my opinion doesn't matter? Your opinion isn't allowed to matter for the rest of us. We're all a morty. How many chunks of us are we supposed to give up? Look, I don't know about you, but I was already taking a big leap of faith here. We're basically giving up our lives to become a tiny part of a stranger. These lives aren't real. Yeah, but they're longer. What? What is this suicide by summit meeting? Everyone, stop. Rick, I'll get every single part of me to get on every ship and go with you. Good. But you have to tell us you love us. I mean, at this point, even if he said it, what what's with the pause? Screw you. Wait for it. Holy war. Holier war. Holiest war ever. Loyalist evacuatratic grandsonistas claimed the seven new cities today. While the state contraurgent confederation of dedication to video game reality invaded the territories of Portopia, New South St. Morty, and we Morial. In the end, what does it matter? Everyone's Morty. Nobody wants to die, and that's a hell of a reason to kill yourself. But what can we do? Oh jeez. You know you're my grandson and none of this is real. What are you trying to achieve? You're only hurting yourself. The only reason any of us matter is we're pieces of Morty. You taught us that, Rick. But you also taught us you don't care about Morty. Here's how much I care. If you don't stop blowing up my flying saucers, I will exterminate every last one of you. Anything it takes. What do I have to say? I love and respect you. Okay. Too late for talk, Rick. A robot. Of course. I'm not going to risk dying because if I die in the game, you go brain dead. You're welcome. Better to die in Roy than to serve in hell. What about Summer? Do Do you not care about her? We got to get back, Morty. We got to help her. What? Wherever she is, I'm sure she's doing fine without your help. Woof. Jinx anyone? Should we finish the job? But blow the place? No. This can't end. Not like this. Do you think I jinx her? Why aren't you shooting higher? I don't want to shoot the glass. Because you don't have to not do things that were done in Die Hard. You can shoot the glass. Shoot the glass. Throw grenades. Do everything. Just kill her. Why are you here, Miss Die Hard? I want to know why you don't just leave. Dieard. Wait. person on a spaceship and then what? Then we help your sister do her die hard. Too much. It's too much. Sorry. I've got a special guest with me, Miss Die Hard. Or should I call you this guy's sister? Mom. Hello, dear. I'm joining the other side. What? Why? I want to live in the real world with Roy. I want to help Summer with her die hard. His name is Rick and we have no way of knowing if your generation is actually part of Morty. Do you know how offensive that is? It's parenting like this that pushed me into religious radicalism. Bye. It's not not a religion, but okay. Ma'am, it's really not safe out here. Also, it's time. Are we going on the spaceship now? Pretty soon, Dad. Yeah. Are you lying? You kind of said it with that tone in your voice that we use for dying people. I won't lie to you. You're dying, Dad. And we're not leaving the video game. We're We're going to live our lives out here. What? Why the Why? It's more real here. The hell it is. My liver hurts. I'm old here. I want to be a teenage boy. I want to jump around and do homework and jerk off all over the place. But dad, that's we would have been one tiny part of that. In here, we get to be who we really are. Yeah, great. Dead. I get to be a dead father. Who do I make the Who do I who don't talk? Dad got to finish my singer. You don't Who do Who do Who do Do I make the check out to Best ever incorporated? Thought you would have left by now. I was hoping to get at least half of you home. I can't hold out much longer. Pretty much beating my heart voluntarily at this point. Okay, this is a little awkward, but the time dilation has given me a chance to reflect. And I I I got to say there's no need for that. I've come to tell you I'm giving the go-ahad. All of Morty will leave with you to the real world to be your grandson. May we help Summer do her die hard. I I got to say I I was not expecting that. Why the change of heart? My people are staying only out of loyalty to me. I'm a relic. I don't represent them anymore. You really are a good grandson. You know that. I'm proud of you, Morty. Please call me Marta. That's my video game name. Speaking of which, I do have one condition. I must say I admire you Miss Die Hard. You are a genuine MLAN, a most worthy Yankee Doodle to Ruffian. But now it's all come to an end. And the quarterback, as they say, is toast. I don't suppose you have a gun taped to your back? What the hell does that mean? It's how Die Hard ends. Doesn't matter now. Die Hard tapes a gun to his back. That's the end of your perfect movie that you've patterned your whole criminal life after. Well, it seems to have worked out pretty well for me since you're the one about to die. What was it you said? Ah, yes. Walkietalkie die hard mother. Why are you laughing? Well, it's funny the way you said motherucker. Just laughing. Okay, it's just that. Oh, does that happen in Die Hard? Does John Mlan laugh and then Hans Gruber is confused, but then they start laughing together for a second? That actually does happen. Yes. Wait, you knew their names this whole time? Not this whole time. No, you left your book in the bathroom. I read it while I took a [ __ ] I mean, mostly the ending do baby. Nice timing, Grandpa Rick. Dr. O Allesia. Uh, hi. Remember me? You shot me on that table, and the near-death experience got me reflecting. I didn't used to be like this. I I uh ate a kid. It was dark and I thought he was a grown-up. Ever since then, I haven't eaten anybody at all. I think I was channeling all that pentup eating energy into this job. But now, thank you for free. Classic tower man. Almost too on the nose, right, Morty? Sure. I mean, whatever you say, Rick. You know best. I trust you implicitly. Is he all right? Oh, yeah. He's fine. Got them all out. Every last piece. What's with the jacked up Roy machine? Shouldn't you be taking that to repairs? Ah, special order. Some rich douche wants his last game to keep running. Hooked it up to an external battery. We're just supposed to store it. Weird. Yeah. And get this. The game's still going, but Royy's dead. What? Yeah. He's just a corpse floating at the edge out of space. But for some reason, the game won't restart cuz it sended on some old lady living a full life. Hm. Sounds bad. Well, put it in there. Hey, is anybody that watch this later going to be able to Huh? Oh, yeah. Everything's cataloged and tracked. People got the wrong idea from the size of the space, but it's all supported digitally. So, I can put it any Before we move off this topic, can I ask if you're currently a hologram? Yeah. Yeah. Hold on one sec. Left a bag of funions down there last week. Didn't want to waste our time. Okay, let's do it. Therapy me. Do you need to take that? No, just the president. Maybe we should turn off the phone. President of the United States. Thought you might think that was cool. You like it when people think you're cool. You're extra analytical today. Looking to remodel your kitchen. Sanchez. I know you're in there. When I called you directly, it's an emergency. I was in therapy. Don't stigmatize mental health. How rude of me. Hello. I'm President Andre Curtis. I recognize you. How nice. It's not nice to recognize a president. Can we go? In 1961, the CIA secretly relocated the Loch Ness monster to Lake Erie and replaced her bones with titanium. She was then bit by several whale wolves, giving us the ultimate anti-ubmarine weapon. Got it. But the Soviets smuggled in a leprechaun who turned Nessie's bones to silver, giving her the wear version of AIDS. She sank to the bottom, and we assumed she was dead, but she was only asleep. Now she's awake and hungry. You can't date my shrink. What? Bro, you're nuts. And don't date my shrink. I'm not dating your shrink. She probably doesn't even like me. Stand down, Sanchez. Tell him to stand down. Would you let him bang your therapist? I don't believe in therapy. What the hell does that even mean? You don't believe in it. He's a Scientologist. Don't take my shrink. And don't be a space Mormon. Why not? It's silly. Sorry, it's a cheap shot. Worship how you want. I like Tom Cruz. Thank you. Therapy is working. Keep it in your pants. Ooh. Welcome back to Mr. Stabby. Let's get another question from the audience. Why do people get tickets to his tapings? It's a fame obsessed culture. Mr. President, I got an emergency ready. Another president mission. You just killed the Lochess monster for him. Tell that little [ __ ] to Zip it. You can't talk to me like that. Tell Tell him he can't talk to me like that. Can't talk to Morty like that. Whatever. I'll portal over. I've seen this one anyway. The audience dies. Rick, thanks for coming. We've got a situation in the state of Virginia. Bigfoot. That's Montana. Nazis. That's everywhere. That's an exaggeration, sir. Oh, Jesus, Carl. You, too. The problem in Virginia is love. You've heard the state motto, Virginia is for lovers. Well, now they've codified it into law. Virginia has declared itself literally and exclusively for lovers. Sounds boring. It gets worse. There's no crime, no poverty, and suspiciously no complaints. The governor just hit 100% approval rating. And that's worse. 100%. Get on the web, Dwayne. There's no such thing as 100% of anything. America knows it and incinerates a cult when it sees one. But I can't do that to all of Virginia. So, we need to infiltrate. I volunteer to do acid to prove I'm not a cop. No lone wolves. We need a crack team for this one. Rick, meet Flee Flack. He might be able to tell the future. Might. We're waiting to find out. Onyx here is a weapons specialist. And our eye in the sky is my chief of staff bot, Chi-Chi. Sleek. Yes. An excellent team. Ah, but there's something missing. A psychology expert, perhaps. Oh, [ __ ] me. You pretended to need a crack team so you could get Wong's number. Get her number. I own the CIA. If I wanted, I could get her genome. So, you wanted what from me? Permission. You got it. It's a free country, so you're always saying. That's certainly all I'd be willing to pay. You're making me choose you or her. There's three billion women on this planet that have nothing to do with me. Can you blame them? You suck. Free danger. Wow, that's great, buddy. It's going right on the fridge. I appreciate you're lending your expertise to this mission, Dr. Wong. Gun. No, thank you. I was surprised to receive your call, but excited. I haven't done field work since grad school. We think the people of Virginia have become some kind of hippie sex cult. I haven't done that since grad school either. Dr. Wong, you are a firecracker. Sir, we've reached the border. I'm so sorry, Mr. President. Virginia is closed to visitors. I thought it was for lovers. I'm a lover. You guys lovers. I appreciate that, but the rest of your country doesn't need Virginia's love right now. You know, the last time a state talked that way, we had to have a whole thing. And and this time the other side has nukes. Let them in. Well done, doctor. Call me Helen. As you can see, Virginia has no crime, no poverty. All goods are freely given. Communist bastard. And all goods are freely made. Communist bastards. So, what happened? Tell me the secret. Well, if I tell you, you'll tell everyone. But if I show you, you won't have to. How unsettling and cryptic. My god. So, that's it. You're all just drunk, sir. It's some kind of body stitching. Hi, mine. Finally, your religion comes in handy. No. My only chance at meeting Will Smith. Huh? Pick up your phone, [ __ ] When I call, it's an actual emergency. Rick, unity. Take it easy. Take it easy. I can explain. Just let me get things under control. You're controlling things is the explanation. And we agreed you wouldn't do it where I work. The [ __ ] are you spraying me with? A new scent I picked up after you left. I call it separation. You concocted a me repellent. Does that look like a bad idea? Rick, are you in a relationship with the population of Virginia? We dated. I just want to talk. I'm pretty sure you have trillions of cell phones. No. Come back. Let's talk. Thank god you had a crack team with you. Where's Helen? Helen? She initiated first name. Whoa. Call on a chopper. I'm being [ __ ] blocked. RIP. It's me. I was released from Unity. Cool. So, you won't mind if I spray this? Well, I won't, but we're surrounded. And Unity knows your reload time. I really believe you and Unity should talk. How would you know? You're just a nutritionist. When you work in nutritionism as long as I have, you get a certain feel. Calm down. We came because we're worried about you. Why? We hear things, Rick. I tried calling, but is it true you're looking for him again? You almost died last time. That's none of your business. You're our business. You quit that business and you're fired from that business. And I'm using your last paycheck to cover the stapler you stole, which was my heart. Civil War, baby. Sorry, that was supposed to be suppressive. Rick, wait. Thank you, Andre. Thank you, Helen. It's time to put these bastards on ice. Queue up the dome. Yes, sir. Ow. Do you have a dome the size of every state? You'll need a second date for that answer. Barf. A nation in turmoil tonight as the entire state of Virginia continues to be trapped inside an energy dome. The White House released a statement dismissing the president's shouts of civil war, baby, as hyperbole. Shondaanda, what do we make of that? More like hyperbully, Tom. Oh [ __ ] Shley came to play. This president has been in office for how many alien invasions? Not to mention the mutant turkeys, the abandoned White House orbiting our planet, the eco-conscious dinosaurs. Then he sees Virginia with its perfect economy and synchronized lawnmowing. So he shoots them and puts them in a dump. Classic. Will someone mute the goddamn news? If I want a list of my failures, I'll dig up my mother. I'm I'm I'm sorry. That's a turnoff, right? Guy screaming about his mother in a war room. Sanchez, America hates your dome. How long is it going to be up? Hope you mark that. It was his dome in the chopper. Now it's mine. It will contain that part of unity until I shut it down because one of us here knows how to set boundaries. Rick, I agree that my accepting this mission was inappropriate. When I was invited, I didn't know that he was hitting on you. I was aware of potential romantic motivations and I was open to them. Bam. But I did not know you and I would be crossing paths. You mean you didn't care because on one hand you got professional ethics and in the other hand you got world famous schlong. Now I get to beat you. Bring it. Alien vessel approaching Earth. It's hailing us. Put it through. I don't work for you. You couldn't. You suck. I'll do it. Mr. President. Lady, you bring that ship to America's planet. I'm launching 4,000 warheads. 3,000 of which will turn out to work. Then I'll call China and you're really [ __ ] Let's listen to Unity. Are you still here? Are you? If I wanted Earth, I would have taken it. You cut 8 million pieces of me off. It hurt. Boohoo. We've made it clear we can't be friends, Rick. But I need to reconnect those people so I can properly release them. They're hosting a mindless collective. If it connects to another mind, it could become its own colony. Oh, wow. You made a PowerPoint. I needed you to understand how serious this is. I can handle it. We got the spray, [ __ ] Don't talk to them like that. Rick, do you not trust unity? Shut up. Apologize. Eat me. Do you not trust me, Rick? Who would let Rick answer? Baby, I know you wouldn't help, but Andre, I think we need to move slower. Slower. I haven't even touched you, and you're already backseat war rooming. Andre. Helen. Rick, I don't trust you. You ghosted me to focus on your work. Your work is absorbing the universe. But it's my universe. Please go. We'll spray the Virginiaians before they touch anyone. I'm sorry you lost a finger, but that's the price of surprise butt play. Goodbye. Goodbye. Alien vessel is departing. Good job, people. I'll run the aerosol cannon from the chopper. We need the optics. Send out a press release. President sprays Virginia with the opposite of bullets. Write it better than that. You riding shotgun or you stay in butt hurt. Suck my dick and lose my number. You too. If you invite me to the wedding, I will [ __ ] in the punch. He'll be back. What would you like for dinner? I'm not interested in taking this further. What? Why? That's insane. How can you be a therapist and insane? Since you're asking for feedback, my sincere advice is that you overcome your need for approval. Okay, you want to play it that way? There's an exit tunnel by the ladies room. It gets lots of use and not just by sex workers. Can you at least tell security I did the dumping? Uh, you okay? Yes. The news said Virginia was a hive mind. Yes. Was it? Yes. Oh my god, dude. Whatever. When's the last time you saw your therapist? Today. Well, then she sucks. No [ __ ] Well, stop yelling at me. I need boundaries. Well, here's a big one, [ __ ] face. Sorry. Arriving at the dome, sir. Good. I don't need anybody. What? What? I said good. Tell me when we're there. We are. Roger that. Just going to see how we're looking. And there's helicopter 1 with the aforementioned gas. And you can actually see President Curtis inside checkging his phone to see if this will make people like him. There he is frowning now, of course, as he realizes no amount of spectacle is going to undo his last debacle. Shonda. Not Shonda. She hates me. That's true, Tom. I mean, yes. President Curtis is going to release Virginia from yet another alien threat. But when they are free to speak their minds, does he really think they're going to say, ""Wow, what a president."" Deactivating dome, sir. The fact is nothing short of literally a 100% approval rating is going to save Curtis in the next election. Let her rip, sir. 100% approval. Whoopsie. I I I'll be right back. Sir, I just got to get the thing. How is that going to work? Give it to me. Give me that hive. Mother, forgive me. Just forgive me. I need it. Holy [ __ ] Loved ones are gathered here to reunite with the captives who appear to be walking quite eagerly and now running in perfect unison toward them. Such a beautiful scene. Everyone kisses. And now everyone that got kisses is kissing everyone else. Heartfelt, almost disgusting kisses. The wave of affection is headed in all directions. Hello, sir. The president has saved us. He's the best president. The best man really ever. His mother was wrong. Uh-oh. Did somebody close the lady tunnel? Hey, Rick. Was Unity? She's gone and I don't care. I think she's back. Hm. Someone order a cranky dick. I said I was sorry. No, you didn't. I said it quietly. Shut up. Now, Governor, can you explain why all of Virginia ran in all directions and puked on everyone in the country? It's simple, news man. They puke in love of the president. We approve of the president. Everyone does. Sorry, governor, but you're making me bring Shonda into this. Thanks, Tom. Governor, I can assure you that no matter how you personally may feel Good president. President, good, good, good. Are you okay? Josh just vomited into Oh, I get it now. Wow, what a president. Approval here. President approved. I thought Unity promised to never do this. That's not Unity. You could stay inside and lock up. Dad's still out shopping. Then stay inside. Lock up and plug your ears. Where are you going? Therapy. Thank God. You're rehired. Is Is that Unity? It's your boyfriend. He must have linked with the severed hive mind. He's going to assimilate the earth faster than I can fight it. And you want me to talk to him? There's no talking to him. No human mind can keep itself together while controlling millions of people. So where are we going? I need Unity's help. So you need to convince her I'm worth it. You aren't. So lie. Inbound vessel detected. Tell him to turn around. Tell me in person. I'm already here. Damn it. But your ship was just You have your gimmicks. I have mine. This is my therapist. She can vouch for me. We met. She was me for a second. What do you want, Rick? Look, it's clear you weren't lying when you said you could have taken over Earth because your finger just took over America. I need you to help me fix that. Oh, it took that to make you believe me? Why should I believe you? You show up unannounced and hijack a state. I called you multiple times. You ghosted me. Rick, is that true? She dumped me. Why would I answer her calls? All right, I'm going to commit a cardinal sin in couple's therapy here. But Rick, I think you're wrong. bringing you is a mistake. You had an outer space lady who was worried for your life and your response was hostile enough to cause a huge problem. Thank you. Now you're asking her to both forgive you and solve it. Unity, I think the reason Rick brought me here is that he doesn't know how to indicate to you he's changed because he's changing very slowly. But he is. All right. Anyone else want to call me a baby? Maybe we can drag this out until Earth is fully assimilated. All right. So, you're asking for an invasion. Hold them back. They love me. They just forgot. They just forgot. They just forgot. No. Stop. You love me. What? Why are you stopping? I've won you over. Oh, good. You're here, Unity. Kept them warm for you. They went a little crazy, but uh anyway, seems like this is all over. Helen, we could grab some coffee. Wait, Unity, what are you doing? All right, Rick, that's everyone. Nice job, Yun. Well, this has been quite a session. Hope you do group discounts. Actually, just send the bill to the White House. I wouldn't be doing this for anyone else, Rick. Yeah, it was nice to team up again. No, I mean I wouldn't be doing it. I've never released hundreds of millions of people before. This is going to suck. Come on. Here. It's over. Nice job, Dune. I'm fine. You want a painkiller? I uh I'm not a few of them right now. No, thank you. I mean, you can hang out if you want. Come see the kids. I trust you now. That's nice, but I don't trust you. Fair enough. Hey Rick, it's Unity. Uh, give me a call. Okay. Hey, Rick. Unity. Look, cards on the table. I heard you were going after that guy again. Just made me worried. Give me a call. Look, I get it. I dumped you. You're ignoring me. But I care about you and I I just want to know you're all right. Hey, Rick. Listen. I'm just going to stop by Virginia. Okay. I don't know what state you live in, but I'll camp out there and try to reach you. Hope you're okay. Hey Rick, David Msgavage here. Heard you were saying some really great things about Scientology. If you ever want to meet Travolta and play back, you uh really went all in on that approval, huh? Yeah. Shonda's going to eat me alive. Ah, [ __ ] him. Thanks, Rick. Don't take this the wrong way, but before we move off this topic, can I ask if you're currently a hologram? Yeah. Yeah. Hold on one sec. Left a bag of bunions down there last week. Didn't want to waste our time. Okay, let's do it. Therapy me. Do you need to take that? No, just the president. Maybe we should turn off the phone. President of the United States. Thought you might think that was cool. You like it when people think you're cool. You're extra analytical today. Looking to remodel your kitchen. Sanchez, I know you're in there. When I called you directly, it's an emergency. I was in therapy. Don't stigmatize mental health. How rude of me. Hello. I'm President Andre. I recognize you. How nice. It's not nice to recognize a president. Can we go? In 1961, the CIA secretly relocated the Loch Ness monster to Lake Erie and replaced her bones with titanium. She was then bit by several whale wolves, giving us the ultimate anti-ubmarine weapon. Got it. But the Soviets smuggled in a leprechaun who turned Nessie's bones to silver, giving her the wear version of AIDS. She sank to the bottom, and we assumed she was dead, but she was only asleep. Now she's awake and hungry. You can't date my shrink. What? Bro, you're nuts. And don't date my shrink. I'm not dating your shrink. She probably doesn't even like me. Stand down, Sanchez. Tell him to stand down. Would you let him bang your therapist? I don't believe in therapy. What the hell does that even mean? You don't believe in it. He's a Scientologist. Don't take my shrink. And don't be a space Mormon. Why not? It's silly. Sorry, it's a cheap shot. Worship how you want. I like Tom Cruz. Thank you. Therapy is working. Keep it in your pants. Ooh. Welcome back to Mr. Stabby. Let's get another question from the audience. Why do people get tickets to his tapings? It's a fame obsessed culture. Mr. President, I got an emergency ready. Another president mission. You You just killed the Lochess monster for him. Tell that little [ __ ] to zip it. You can't talk to me like that. Tell Tell him he can't talk to me like that. You can't talk to Morty like that. Whatever. I'll portal over. We've seen this one anyway. The audience dies. Rick, thanks for coming. We've got a situation in the state of Virginia. Bigfoot. That's Montana. Nazis. That's everywhere. That's an exaggeration, sir. Oh, Jesus, Carl. You, too. The problem in Virginia is love. You've heard the state motto, Virginia is for lovers. Well, now they've codified it into law. Virginia has declared itself literally and exclusively for lovers. Sounds boring. It gets worse. There's no crime, no poverty, and suspiciously no complaints. The governor just hit 100% approval rating. And that's worse. 100%. Get on the web, Dwayne. There's no such thing as 100% of anything. America knows it and incinerates a cult when it sees one. But I can't do that to all of Virginia. So, we need to infiltrate. I volunteer to do acid to prove I'm not a cop. No lone wolves. We need a crack team for this one. Rick, meet Flee Flack. He might be able to tell the future. Might. We're waiting to find out. Onyx here is a weapons specialist and our eye in disguise is my chief of staff bot Chi-Chi. Sleek. Yes, an excellent team. Ah, but there's something missing. A psychology expert, perhaps. Oh, [ __ ] me. You pretended to need a crack team so you could get Wong's number. Get her number. I own the CIA. If I wanted, I could get her genome. So, you wanted what from me? Permission? You got it. It's a free country, so you're always saying. That's certainly all I'd be willing to pay. You're making me choose. You or her? There's three billion women on this planet that have nothing to do with me. Can you blame them? You suck. Danger. Wow, that's great, buddy. It's going right on the fridge. I appreciate you're lending your expertise to this mission, Dr. Wong. Gun? No, thank you. I was surprised to receive your call, but excited. I haven't done field work since grad school. We think the people of Virginia have become some kind of hippie sex cult. I haven't done that since crowd school either. Dr. Wong, you are a firecracker. Sir, we've reached the border. I am so sorry, Mr. President. Virginia is closed to visitors. I thought it was for lovers. I'm a lover. You guys lovers. I appreciate that, but the rest of your country doesn't need Virginia's love right now. You know, the last time a state talked that way, we had to have a whole thing. And and this time the other side has nukes. Let them in. Well done, doctor. Call me Helen. As you can see, Virginia has no crime, no poverty. All goods are freely given. Communist bastard. And all goods are freely made. Communist bastards. So, what happened? Tell me the secret. Well, if I tell you, you'll tell everyone. But if I show you, you won't have to. How unsettling and cryptic. My god. So, that's it. You're all just drunk, sir. It's some kind of body snatching high mind. Finally, your religion comes in handy. No. My only chance at meeting Will Smith. Huh? pick up your phone, [ __ ] When I call, it's an actual emergency. Rick, unity. Take it easy. Take it easy. I can explain. Just let me get things under control. You controlling things is the explanation. And we agreed you wouldn't do it where I work. The [ __ ] are you spraying me with? A new scent I picked up after you left. I call it separation. You concocted a me repellent. Does that look like a bad idea? Rick, are you in a relationship with the population of Virginia? We dated. I just want to talk. I'm pretty sure you have trillions of cell phones. No. Come back. Let's talk. Thank god you had a crack team with you. Where's Helen? Helen? She initiated first night. Whoa. Calling a chopper. I'm being [ __ ] blocked. Rick, it's me. I was released from Unity. Cool. So, you won't mind if I spray this? Well, I won't, but we're surrounded. And Unity knows your reload time. I really believe you and Unity should talk. How would you know? You're just a nutritionist. When you work in nutritionism as long as I have, you get a certain feel. Calm down. We came because we're worried about you. You? Why? We hear things, Rick. I tried calling, but is it true you're looking for him again? You almost died last time. That's none of your business. You're our business. You quit that business and you're fired from that business. And I'm using your last paycheck to cover the stapler you stole, which was my heart. Civil War, baby. Sorry, that was supposed to be suppressive. Rick, wait. Thank you, Andre. Thank you, Helen. It's time to put these bastards on ice. Queue up the dome. Yes, sir. Ow. Do you have a dome the size of every state? You'll need a second date for that answer. Barf. A nation in turmoil tonight as the entire state of Virginia continues to be trapped inside an energy dome. The White House released a statement dismissing the president's shouts of civil war, baby, as hyperbole. Shondaanda, what do we make of that? More like hyperbully, Tom. Oh [ __ ] Shley came to play. This president has been in office for how many alien invasions? Not to mention the mutant turkeys, the abandoned White House orbiting our planet, the eco-conscious dinosaurs.

When I was invited, I didn't know that he was hitting on you. I was aware of potential romantic motivations and I was open to them. Bam. But I did not know you and I would be crossing paths. You mean you didn't care? Because on one hand you got professional ethics and in the other hand you got world famous schlong. Now I get to beat you. Bring it. Alien vessel approaching Earth. It's hailing us. Put it through. I don't work for you. You couldn't. You suck. I'll do it. Mr. President, later you bring that ship to America's planet. I'm launching 4,000 warheads. 3,000 of which will turn out to work. Then I'll call China and you're really [ __ ] Let's listen to Unity. Are you still here? Are you?

But write it better than that. You riding shotgun or you stay in butt hurt. Suck my dick and lose my number. You too. If you invite me to the wedding, I will [ __ ] in the punch. He'll be back. What would you like for dinner? I'm not interested in taking this further. What? Why? That's insane. How can you be a therapist and insane?

I don't know what state you live in, but I'll camp out there and try to reach you. Hope you're okay. Hey Rick, David Msgavage here. Heard you were saying some really great things about Scientology. If you ever want to meet Travolta and play back, you uh really went all in on that approval, huh? Yeah. Shonda's going to eat me alive. Ah, [ __ ] him. Thanks, Rick. Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm going to rip out your screen and feed it to your husband. Uh-oh. Wouldn't want that. Yikes. Morty, we better run before it figures out what a husband is. This This carnival of nightmares used to be scary, right? Huh? We've seen too much. It sucks, you know, cuz it it's fun to break off a scare now and then. Did I hear you fellas wishing for some good old-fashioned scares? I mean, I more wish you wouldn't eaves drop. Yeah, who are you? Does the suit mean you work here or that you super don't work here? Like yourselves, I'm a connoisseur of fear. I'm also originally from Earth. And did you know Earth is the home of the single scariest place in the galaxy? I can show you if you'd like. We were headed that way anyway. Take a left. Almost there. We know where Earth is. For guys like you, you know, who've seen it all, there's only a few real fears left to conquer. And one of them is right down here. Okay. What the hell? Yeah, this is punching down. Denny's is a nice chain that gives people starchy food when they're up late. It's a heck joke, buddy. Well, this is the place. Good luck to both of you. I'm going to get myself a slam. He just wanted a ride, right? Certainly took us for one. Well, as long as we're here. Okay. Hey, lumberjack slam, graham slam, pancake puppy, slam burger, two milkshakes, and an order of cheddar tots. Let me know when you want your check. And if you're here for the hole, it's in the men's bathroom. The what now? Hole. The fear hole. Men's bathroom. Well, it's definitely a hole. They weren't lying about that. Is that hair seaweed? Boy, it's really circling the whole rim. Huh? Guess you got to jump in without touching the sides. You think there's spikes on the bottom? I don't think they want you to go in there and just die. What kind of business would that be? Well, they're not drowning in money. They still have a built-in TV VCR. Hey, it's that carnival guy. Oh, so he gets a kickback. Hi, welcome to the hole. Here's how it works. You jump in. The hole manifests your greatest fear. You conquer that fear and come out well fearless. And you get your picture on the wall. What does the hole get out of it? Well, you know those fish that nibble dead skin off your feet? The hole's kind of like that. It eats fear. You win, it wins. Have fun and enjoy the hole. Hey, Gaffy, cool your jets with a taste of Mountain Dew. This has been here since VHS tapes and there's only three photos. Yeah, my tots are getting cold. So, you don't want to do it? Do you? I mean, it says it takes away your greatest fear. My greatest fear, Morty, is trusting a gross hole to conquer my fear. And I conquer that fear by walking away. Okay, fine. You little turd. Oh god. Still while I stuff you with maggots. Okay. The whole thinks I'm scared of not having a gun. Fear conquers. Check out them gains. Morty, where are you? Morty, let's go. Oh jeez. Oh god. Oh man, we both [ __ ] our pants. What a [ __ ] ride. My butt. My butt. [ __ ] yeah. On the wall, [ __ ] It's not worth it. Not worth it. Oh my god. You both. What is that? Morty and I [ __ ] our pants. You're looking at the two newest members of the whole club. Uh, okay. [ __ ] What the hell? Bomb almost killed her. Take care of our wife. Rick. No. Oh my god. No. No. Mom. Where am I? Who are you people? You're my mom. But you're young. Rick, what's happening? Wait. Rick, what the [ __ ] Grandpa, say something. Okay, we're clearly still in the hole. That's exactly what I was thinking. You never left the hole. And part of the hole is thinking you left the hole in there. and it can really dig into you. Cuz you can't really be scared of anything if you know you're still in the hole. What the [ __ ] are you two talking about? Why is dead grandma alive in our living room? Rick, why are you old? Oh, great questions. You guys get reacquainted while we grab some equipment. Wait, are we sure this isn't like a double mislead? A double mislead? Like we went into a generic fear hole and then coincidentally came home to that? That's That's my wife from the day I lost her. Well, what's it got to do with me, Rick? Right. I think I figured it out. Morty, your greatest fear is me getting Diane back and being happy again. What? Why? Because then I won't need you. Look how scared you're getting just talking about it. I'm not scared. I'm insulted. What kind of backhanded ass theory is that? My greatest fear is you hooking up. You're right. We can't know for sure until I get more data. All right, family. Who wants to catch up over ice cream? I knew he was working on teleportation, but wouldn't this be time travel? Oh, Dad never touches time travel. He calls it the long Long Island iced tea of science fiction. Yes, but then what what is this? Don't worry about it. It's not real. Okay, I figure it's better to do this in front of you. I I didn't want to walk in deaged. What do you think, T? 45. Younger. I don't care about your age, Rick. I don't even want to call you that. That's my husband's name. He just died. I know. So, 27. Dad, you're traumatizing her. What? It's my face, too. And now Diane gets to understand that I'm still sexy and a genius. What a kindness. You were right, Rick. I'm really terrified right now. Terrified of what? If you don't mind, I'd like to get to know the adult version of my Oh my god. Where's my real daughter? Sweetie, it's all right. This may as well be our real daughter because she's just as real as you. What? Put it this way. You're all basically NPCs. Only Morty and I are real. So, your side quests don't matter. The main quest is us. You're disgusting. You're talking about our baby girl like she's theoretical. Welcome to the family. No, you don't get it, honey. Even if this was real, she'd only be a version of your daughter who could also be a clone of your daughter. Stop wearing my husband's face. You're nothing like him. Because I lost you. Maybe you didn't deserve me. You want to hear a new theory? Maybe your greatest fear is getting a second chance with her and blowing it. You don't think that fear has been pretty well faced? Then you haven't conquered it or accepted it or something or something. I'm not a fearologist. Morty, all romcoms have an arc. Even You've Got Mail begins with Tom Hanks killing that cop. Really? I don't know. I'm not going to [ __ ] watch You've Got Mail. I'm doing this for you, Morty. The sooner I get her back, the sooner you can conquer your fear of being a useless, lonely turd. You don't think that's been faced? Hello, Diane. Here's the song I rehearsed. You had a bad day and Rick made it worse. He felt bad so he created me. I deliver you waffles and an apology. Why do I have memories of being a human child? Why would I [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] God damn it. There was a whole second verse about inviting you to the zoo with the family. I've seen that robot's arms. Yeah, I used them on a law enforcement drone that the feds had me build. It's how we uh how I met my wife. The zoo sounds nice. And this one time, we raised a civilization living on a zit on my face and grandpa helped me rule over it as queen. It sounds like you guys are a real family now. I wish you could have been part of it, Mom. Oh, honey. Rick, is there a deadline on this theory you're chasing? Yeah, sure. Uh, that's a good idea, Morty. Do do that. I always wished I knew what they were saying. Your master's thesis, non-human intelligence. When did you read that? After you were gone. It helped me develop this. [ __ ] you. [ __ ] you, friend. [ __ ] you, Lisa. Yum. Bread. [ __ ] you. [ __ ] you. There's bread. I guess that's what I expected. Anticlimactic, isn't it? Yeah, they kind of suck. Hey, want to grab a drink? Hey, flick cribble market sentence. When did you stop being a lightweight? kept looking for my wife at the bottom of a bottle. You're pathetic. Hey to being pathetic. Clear cheese. My turn. My turn. Tell you what, old man. Seems like losing me made you cooler. I should die more often. You did. You died everywhere forever. You're the only thing I can't replace. Okay. Okay, Mr. Weepy. I'm not even real. Remember? Nothing's real. That's your jam, right? My grandson, our grandson, thinks this is happening because my greatest fear is letting you go. Then don't. I don't want to. Then kiss me. I'm old and we have puke mouth. Well, I'm not here and it's not real puke. Okay, Rick. Whoa, dude. [ __ ] you, Morty. It's a blazer. That's not what he meant. You look sick. The hole is feeding on you. I thought it's supposed to eat my fear. Can we get some [ __ ] rules up in this hole? I don't know the rules. Maybe you're dying because you've been in here too long. Interesting theory. I wonder why you're so rosy cheicked. What are you saying? Maybe the real you is off somewhere running from spiders. Oh, so now I'm not real. Yeah, maybe my greatest fear is having to tell you to [ __ ] the [ __ ] off. Go ahead and face it. [ __ ] the [ __ ] off. Hey, ready to show biz pizza? Let me see that fair play banjo. Here's one for you. I'm afraid of watching you die. I like that theory, Morty. So, stop watching. Okay, this is it. You nailed it. My worst nightmare. I'd like to leave the hole now. Hey, hey, hole. I'm talking to you. Are you listening? So, what are you like the hole? The holes promoter? The ho's intern. Is there a hole here? Right. I'm I'm supposed to go in there and be shocked that there's no hole or that there is a hole. What difference would it make? H, you are hard to scare. And Rick isn't, right? The the hole's going to like suck on him forever because his big secret is that he's got the most fear. Well, we can certainly say you're not afraid to be reductive. I doubt your grandpa has more fear than the average [ __ ] in a Denny's. Sorry. If anything, he seems pretty brave. Certainly not afraid to die. Maybe that makes his fear extra delicious. So what? He's scared of love. Everyone's scared of love, [ __ ] You learned that in your 20s. It takes a very rare, very powerful being to be terrified of happiness. Dumb. You're dumb. That's why you're not scared to be happy. The smarter you are, the more you know. Happiness is a trap. It can't last forever. Let's say you meet the love of your life. Well, it's still going to end. It's inevitable. Whether by the slow pull of a disease or the shock of loose footing on a hiking trail. Whether it be the corrosion of two personalities that reshape each other until they're incompatible. Or maybe the old stranger in a bar who says the things that need to be said to that person that night. The point is happiness always ends. Best case scenario, think about this. Best case is that you die at the same time. Yikes. Can't the whole just let me go then? Sounds like I don't matter. You don't. But if you go, you'll take him away. Don't worry, Rick will die before accepting happiness. After that, we'll chase you with some clowns or some dumb [ __ ] like that. But Grandpa, yummy, yummy. Grandpa's going to die just like Diane. Sir, you've been in this booth for a really long time. One coffee isn't going to cut it. That's fair. Want to split some pancake puppies? No. Beth, Summer, anyone? Dad, it's not real. Neither are you. If that's true, then you deal with it. You know what? You're You're right. How about this? Marty, what are you doing? Being scared. How is that not enough fear? You're the one scaring me, Morty. No. No, Dad. It's okay. It's not okay. That wasn't normal. My greatest fear is not being accepted. It should be. And you need to fear it a hell of a lot more. I can do that. Like that. Do you want to die? I have enough unadressed trauma to flood this hallway. You [ __ ] idiot. This list says top five things and he only wrote down four. Truthful. None of us touch or speak to this kid ever. Maybe maybe take a picture. Send it to your friends. Not a bad idea. How can we do the school play if Johnny has laryngitis? There's no understudy. Put me in the play. You don't know the lines. Yes, I do. Three Days of Rain. I have it memorized. And I refuse to prove that until you cast me. Have it your way. But the New York Times is coming and they're doing a feature on the current state of young American theater. Perfect. It ended in a church. What? Yeah, they'd already died. It was purgatory or something. How did your universe's version end? Jack Lock and Sawyer teamed up to kill a fog monster and everyone got rescued. It was one season long and it was perfect television. You can be great or you can be around forever, right? True, true, true, true, true. Where's this going? We doing robot role play? I've got the oil at home. What was that? True. True. Diane. Diane. Diane. Hey, stay with me. Diane. Rick. What's happening? [ __ ] Morty. He's trying to hog the hole. Come on. Alas, our father is dead. Walker, are you here? Uh, I I'm Walker. Uh, sure has been raining a a lot of days. What the [ __ ] is he doing? What's wrong with him? He's naked. And why does he look sick? Because he's dying. [ __ ] I got to get him out of here. But if I do, I might have to go with him. I don't want to. I I don't want to, Diane. I I think my greatest fear is letting you go. That's a good fear, Rick. Keep that fear. If you don't, you'll kill me again. I know, but I don't have to kill Morty, too. How do you know he's even real? Look at his weird little balls. Goodbye, Diane. Shut up, Morty. DJ, drop that beat. We got to conquer a fear. This is my grandson. Don't look at his pee pe. Instead of staring at Morty, put your eyes on me and me. I'm a roped out freak. Loose dog in my ass. Macaroni in my pocket. Rickety master class. I don't know how to rap. I don't know how to rhyme. I don't know how to rap. And now eat my [ __ ] Incredible. Now throw your hands up. Put your hands down. Throw your hands up and put them back down. Three days of rain. That was an astounding feat of personal bravery. Nudity always makes theater serious and good. How do you feel? Accepted. You pathetic but happy. We did it. We conquered our fears, right? Uh, hey Rick. You You just look real sad, which I'm afraid of, you know, uh, of being responsible for your sadness, which means I think we might still be in the hole. Huh. Well, I am definitely afraid of you ever knowing anything before me. So, yeah, I'd say there's a 100% chance that we're still God damn it. This is going to be a whole thing. No word play, Morty. We have to figure out our actual fears if we're ever going to get out of here. Actual fears? Yeah. Tell me your [ __ ] fear so we can conquer it. I just had to crucify myself in order to save you from your whole wife. And you think I'm the one with unresolved fears? I ought to be afraid that we'll never get out because you'll never admit that you're afraid. Okay, good job. You conquered it, right? I think so. How are we supposed to know? No, no. This is real. I can tell. You're not afraid that you could be certain about something and still turn out to be wrong? You cowardly [ __ ] How was I supposed to know? $8 for a side of bacon? Are you [ __ ] kidding me? It's a symptom of a larger concern, Morty. If capitalism collapses, are we done here? I don't know. Aren't you a little afraid at this point of the hole itself? What? I swear to God, if we're still climbing out of this [ __ ] hole two seasons from now, maybe that was it. What? Maybe we needed to let go of our fear of uncertainty, you know? Right. I'd say we're pretty native to that at this point. Okay. Hey, thank you. Hole. Thank you, Hull. We We no longer need to know for you. So, bye. Are you afraid we're still in it? I mean, I hope we're not, but if we are, we'll find out eventually. Which no longer scares me. Same. Okay, I'm going to go get drunk. Maybe there's no way out. Maybe we were born here. Come on. We're going to get through this. I'm staying here. No, we're Rick and Morty. I'm not leaving without you. What? What did you say? I said I'm not leaving you in here. Come on. You're irreplaceable. Irreplaceable. Irreplaceable. What? Oh my god. I I know what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid you'd never say that in real life. I'm afraid that if I jumped into a hole, you wouldn't even bother jumping in after me. You just stand there and watch. This entire thing has been about me. You're not even in the hole, are you? Thank you for visiting the fear hole, Morty. Your fear of relying on Rick has been delicious. Dear God, Morty, how was it? Was it spiders? Oh. Oh jeez. Oh my god. No. You You You didn't go in at all. No, it's a oneperson ride. You can't face two fears at the same time. If If my fear was fire and yours was water, I get it. It's fine. It really is fine. Huh? You do seem a little less burdened, Rick. Am I irreplaceable? I mean, define irreplaceable. That's good. Good. I'm back. Don't or I I won't know if I'm out. Is it that good? Should I go in? No. You holding out on me? You don't want to deal with it, Rick. There was messed up mental [ __ ] in there. Like Diane was in there. What? Not in a good way. Just trust me. Okay, buddy. Let's go slam some pancakes. I'm going to rip out your screen and feed it to your husband. Uh-oh. Wouldn't want that. Yikes. Morty, we better run before it figures out what a husband is. This This carnival of nightmares used to be scary, right? Huh? We've seen too much. It sucks, you know, cuz it it's fun to break off a scare now and then. Did I hear you fellas wishing for some good old-fashioned scares? I mean, I more wish you wouldn't eaves drop. Yeah, who are you? Does the suit mean you work here? Or that you super don't work here? Like yourselves, I'm a connoisseur of fear. I'm also originally from Earth. And did you know Earth is the home of the single scariest place in the galaxy? I can show you if you'd like. We were headed that way anyway. Take a left. Almost there. We know where Earth is. For guys like you, you know, who've seen it all, there's only a few real fears left to conquer. And one of them is right down here. Okay. What the hell? Yeah, this is punching down. Denny's is a nice chain that gives people starchy food when they're up late. It's a heck joke, buddy. Nope. This is the place. Good luck to both of you. I'm going to get myself a slam. He just wanted a ride, right? Certainly took us for one. Well, as long as we're here. Okay. Lumberjack slam, Graham's sandwich, pancake puppy, slam burger, two milkshakes, and an order of cheddar tots. Let me know when you want your check. And if you're here for the hole, it's in the men's bathroom. The what now? Hole. The fear hole. Men's bathroom. Well, it's definitely a hole. They weren't lying about that. What is that? Hair. Seaweed. Boy, it's really circling the whole rim, huh? Guess you got to jump in without touching the sides. You think there's spikes on the bottom? I don't think they want you to go in there and just die. What kind of business would that be? Well, they're not drowning in money. They still have a built-in TV VCR. Hey, it's that carnival guy. Oh, so he gets a kickback. Hi, welcome to the hole. Here's how it works. You jump in. The hole manifests your greatest fear. You conquer that fear and come out well, fearless. And you get your picture on the wall. What does the hole get out of it? Well, you know those fish that nibble dead skin off your feet? The hole's kind of like that. It eats fear. You win, it wins. Have fun and enjoy the hole. Hey, Gaffy, cool your jets with a taste of Mountain Dew. This has been here since VHS tapes, and there's only three photos. Yeah, my tots are getting cold. So, you don't want to do it? Do you? I mean, it says it takes away your greatest fear. My greatest fear, Morty, is trusting a gross hole to conquer my fear. And I conquer that fear by walking away. Okay, fine. You little turd. Oh god. Still when I stuff you with maggots. Okay. The whole thinks I'm scared of not having a gun. Fear conquered. Check out them gains. Morty, where are you? Morty, let's go. Jesus, man. We both [ __ ] our pants. What a [ __ ] ride. My bag. My butt. [ __ ] yeah. On the wall, [ __ ] It's not worth it. Not worth it. Oh my god. You both. What is that? Morty and I [ __ ] our pants. You're looking at the two newest members of the whole club. Uh, okay. Sled. What the hell? Bomb almost killed her. Take care of our wife, Rick. No. Oh my god. No. No. Mom. Where am I? Who are you people? You're my mom, but you're young. Rick, what's happening? Wait, Rick? What the [ __ ] Grandpa, say something. Okay, we're clearly still in the hole. That's exactly what I was thinking. You never left the hole. What part of the hole is thinking you left the hole in there? Then it can really dig into you. Because you can't really be scared of anything if you know you're still in the hole. What the [ __ ] are you two talking about? Why is dead grandma alive in our living room? Rick, why are you old? Oh, great questions. You guys get reacquainted while we grab some equipment. Wait, are we sure this isn't like a double mislead? A double mislead? Like we went into a generic fear hole and then coincidentally came home to that? That's That's my wife from the day I lost her. Well, what's it got to do with me, Rick? Right. I think I figured it out. Morty, your greatest fear is me getting Diane back and being happy again. What? Why? Because then I won't need you. Look how scared you're getting just talking about it.

[ __ ] I got to get him out of here. But if I do, I might have to go with him. I don't want to. I I don't want to, Diane. I I think my greatest fear is letting you go. That's a good fear, Rick. Keep that fear. If you don't, you'll kill me again. I know, but I don't have to kill Morty, too. How do you know he's even real? Look at his weird little balls. Goodbye, Diane. Shut up, Morty. DJ, drop that beat. We got to conquer a fear. This is my grandson. Don't look at his pee pe. Instead of staring at Morty, put your eyes on me and me. I'm a roped out freak. Loose dog in my ass. Macaroni in my pocket. Rickety master class. I don't know how to rap. I don't know how to rhyme. I don't know how to rap. And now eat my [ __ ] Incredible. Now throw your hands up. Put your hands down. Throw your hands up and put them back down. Three days of rain. That was an astounding feat of personal bravery. Nudity always makes theater serious and good. How do you feel? Accepted. You pathetic but happy. We did it. We conquered our fears, right? Uh, hey Rick. You You just look real sad, which I'm afraid of, you know, uh, of being responsible for your sadness, which means I think we might still be in the hole. Huh. Well, I am definitely afraid of you ever knowing anything before me. So, yeah, I'd say there's a 100% chance that we're still God damn it. This is going to be a whole thing. No word play, Morty. We have to figure out our actual fears if we're ever going to get out of here. Actual fears? Yeah. Tell me your [ __ ] fear so we can conquer it. I just had to crucify myself in order to save you from your whole wife. And you think I'm the one with unresolved fears? I ought to be afraid that we'll never get out because you'll never admit that you're afraid. Okay, good job. You conquered it, right? I think so. How are we supposed to know? No, no. This is real. I can tell. You're not afraid that you could be certain about something and still turn out to be wrong? You cowardly [ __ ] How was I supposed to know? $8 for a side of bacon? Are you [ __ ] kidding me? It's a symptom of a larger concern, Morty. If capitalism collapses, are we done here? I don't know. Aren't you a little afraid at this point of the hole itself? What? I swear to God, if we're still climbing out of this [ __ ] hole two seasons from now, maybe that was it. What? Maybe we needed to let go of our fear of uncertainty, you know? Right. I'd say we're pretty native to that at this point. Okay. Hey, thank you, Hole. Thank you, Hull. We We no longer need an offer in you. So, bye. Are you afraid we're still in it? I mean, I hope we're not, but if we are, we'll find out eventually, which no longer scares me. Same. Okay, I'm going to go get drunk. Maybe there's no way out. Maybe we were born here. Come on. We're going to get through this. I'm staying here. No, we're Rick and Morty. I'm not leaving without you. What? What did you say? I said I'm not leaving you in here. Come on. You're irreplaceable. Irreplaceable. Irreplaceable. What? Oh my god. I I know what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid you'd never say that in real life. I'm afraid that if I jumped into a hole, you wouldn't even bother jumping in after me. You just stand there and watch. This entire thing has been about me. You're not even in the hole, are you? Thank you for visiting the fear hole, Morty. Your fear of relying on Rick has been delicious. Dear God. Morty, how was it? Was it spiders? Oh. Oh jeez. Oh my god. No. You You You didn't go in at all. No, it's a oneperson ride. You can't face two fears at the same time. If If my fear was fire and yours was water, I get it. It's fine. It really is fine, huh? You do seem a little less burdened, Rick. Am I irreplaceable? I mean, define irreplaceable. That's good. Good. I'm back. Don't or I I won't know if I'm out. Is it that good? Should I go in? No. You holding out on me? You don't want to deal with it, Rick. There was messed up mental [ __ ] in there. Like Diane was in there. What? Not in a good way. Just trust me. Okay, buddy. Let's go slam some pancakes. Morty, hurry. Return the truth to Morty, whatever you do, don't drop the truth to. Also really important, whatever you do, don't look into its eyes. I I did look at it, Rick. I've been looking at it. Now you're going to know everything, Morty. Good job. Way to go. You [ __ ] everything up. It's in my head. Oh jeez. I I can't get that truth tortoise out of my head. Yeah, I told you not to look into its eyes. Hey Morty, let's watch some interdimensional cable. Remember how I used to do that? Rick, I can't I can't go on I can't go on like this with the truth tortoise [ __ ] in my head. I I wish you could just erase the memory from your mind. How did you know I was going to say that? Come on, Morty. Come with me. after you. What the hell is this? This, Morty, is my archive of all the experiences you've begged me to remove from your life, lest you go insane. I call them Morty's mindblowers. And we'll be doing this instead of Interdimensional Cable. How long have I been asking you to remove memories? Since the first time your mind was blown. Ah, here it is. Classic. There's no dust on it because this isn't the first time we've done this. What? I call this one moonspiracy. Huh? Wow. That's incredible. What the heck? Morty, do you realize how ridiculous that sounds? Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty. Are you serious? Half the crap we've seen. And you think that sounds crazy? I've been to 300 versions of Earth's moon, including this one, and I've never seen signs of a regular dude, as you describe him, hanging out up there. It's probably just a smudge on the lens. Smudge on the lens. Smudge on the lens. I know the difference between a man threatening me and a smudge on the goddamn lens. Summer calm down. Are you feeling okay? I'm fine. So sensitive. Kids, I'd like to introduce you all to our new guidance counselor, Mr. Lunis. I look forward to helping guide you all towards a brighter future. I believe every student should shoot for the moon. Got you now, you son of a [ __ ] What's this? Proof that Mr. Lunas isn't who he says he is. He's not a guidance counselor. I I assume he's qualified to be one. Who isn't? But he also lives on the moon. Okay. Hm. Is that it? Is he doing anything to hurt anyone? Oh, he's up to something. I think I understand. Up to something. Lives on the moon. Okay, I'll talk to him. What did he say? Deny the moon stuff, but that's what pedophiles do. They deny it's their bread and butter. Pedophile? You don't think so? I thought the moon thing might have been code. No, he's literally from the moon. Well, you saw him react. Moon or not, that dude likes him young. Gordon Lunas was a good Marine. We don't know what drove him to take his own life, but we want to remember the good things. Like how from a certain angle some people would say he looked like a smudge. Oh my god. What have I done? What have I done? Jesus. I made that guy kill himself. Only in a literal sense. Here's one I call Morty's Menagerie. They don't all have titles though. It's not a Simpsons Halloween special. More like a clip show made of clips you never saw. Can't believe we got put into a menagery. So, this guy collects living beings? Yeah, you know, like commemorative plates, but less off-putting. You'll get it when you're still actively dating in your 40s. Assess this with cold indifference, you veinyheaded prick. Hey, keep it down. Just our luck. Menagerie beneath the boulder people of Granador 7. I can't take it anymore, Rick. Relax, Morty. I can't relax. Rick, we got to get out of here. I don't care what it takes. Anything. Anything. Anything. All right. Well, you're going to have to take off your shirt. Not yet. I'll tell you when. Dear God. What? The signal turned out to be There's no other way to put it. Instructions for a vehicle. Sir, an interstellar vehicle. We'll need a pilot. I wonder if there's a volunteer. Oh, the schematics specify a second smaller pilot. I mean, they really specify smaller. They have to be exactly 5 foot three. Chang, you may have majored in liberal arts, but I think you're about to make history. Primary systems check. Auxiliary systems check. See you soon. Okay, now. Greetings. You're We possess forms your mind can accept. Here are some customary clothing gifts. Please put them on. May we? Of course. Yes. We followed your instructions. We have so much to learn from you. I know, right? Hey, how come I was able to see those other people's memories? I I wouldn't have been around for that. Yeah, sometimes I got to do a little editing, Morty. You know, it helps the mindblowers play a little bit better upon revisiting. I call this one the whole enchilada. Here, Morty. This will make your urine drinkable now. Can we keep shopping? I'm Zigzac. Oh [ __ ] Morty, get behind me. It's a [ __ ] alien overlord. It's okay. Here. Oh, I misjudged. I'm Floop Floopian. Please kill me. That's right, Morty. The Flu Floopians achieve an eternal orgasmic afterlife so long as they're killed by a great warrior. I'm flattered, by the way. Thank you very much. So, you're going to kill him? Let's get some lunch first. So, you want to get shot in the head or Well, as long as the wound is fatal, I don't really mind where you shoot me. Cool. I'm going to go take a quick [ __ ] Well, I got to say, you know, I'm a little envious. Your species has an actual afterlife. That's got to be nice. What do you mean? Well, you know, here on Earth, we don't know what's going on. It must be nice for you guys to, you know, have that have that proofs in the pudding. You know, evidence. Evidence. There's supposed to be evidence. Um, yeah. I uh I mean otherwise, how do you know if it's true? Wait, you don't. All right. So, you want to do this here or outside? Run. I don't want to die. Oh god, it's all real. Oh, it hurts. Oh, I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have let you make me doubt it. I blame you. I blame you. He said there wasn't any evidence. That was a ton of evidence. Well, silver lining. Now I know their religion's real. They have a hell and it does not look good. I noticed you'd ever finished your chim chunga, so I got some room for it now, if you know what I mean. Holy [ __ ] How many of these are just horrible mistakes I've made? I mean, maybe I'd stop making so many if I let myself learn from them. Don't break your back creating a lesson, Morty. It's a free form anthology. I'm getting annoyed you're not hearing that. As you can see around me, your mind's been blown countless times and not always by yourself. A [ __ ] I don't even This better not have been a good one. What is this great booger? AIDS. AIDS booger. I got to start using real file names. In the meantime, enjoy a grab bag of mindblowers. I call poop aids copy. I'm not an unreasonable man, Beth Smith. I know children are everything to a mammal. I will spare one of their lives. You simply have to choose. Summer. Summer. You're not going to believe this. I went to Phoebe instead of Titan. It's like, ""Hello, Saturn. After 10 moons, time to stop naming and start numbering."" You know what's wh what's with you [ __ ] Morty, please don't do this. Your Morty is gone. I am Voltatron, destroyer of worlds. Grandpa Rick, there must be some scientific way to save him. Not scientific, but there may be a way. Morty, I know you're in there. It's me, your grandpa. I know I can be mean, but I love you, Morty. We all do. You got to fight this thing. I know you can. You're stronger than all of us. Morty, it's mom. We love you. You have to fight it. Come on, Morty. Fight that stupid worm thing. We love you. We love you so much. Yes, Morty. Come on. You're doing it. You're doing it. You're doing it. Should we pull it out? No, don't touch it. Just keep loving, Morty. We still love you, but I do have a thing. It's sick. Oh god. Do I have to keep looking? Jeez. Morty, come on. Pinch it off already. No. Oh god. Sorry, Morty. I love you. God, is there going to be an intermission? Excuse me, but I ordered the large evil space worm. I know. It's like, is that a demon slug in your stomach or are you just happy to Well, I guess it's nice to know the whole family sucks. So, if the blue ones are my fault and the purple ones are my family's, what are the red ones? Yeah. Don't Don't read into it, Morty. [ __ ] We need to find shelter before the sunset, Morty. Venzenulon 9 has a night temperature of 300 below. We'll freeze, Morty. We We'll be dead in seconds. I I I I think I saw a cave over there. Seen too many movies, Morty. A cave isn't going to cut it. We're going to have to use Bibo. Bibbo led us to water. He's our friend. He won't even feel it. Oh, no. No. You want to die, Morty? Get in. Bibbo. Um, no. No. Race for the ice limit. Here it comes. Wait, are we on Venulon 9 or Venulon 7? Wait a minute. Why would I ask for that to be removed? Are the red ones stuff you wanted removed? Oh, that's clever, Morty. But I don't use color to sort things because I'm not a mouse in a European children's book. Then why are all those pink ones by the liquor? Liquor? [ __ ] that was close. We lost Captain Sky. He gave his life for the uprising. Yeah. Really makes you think, huh, Morty? We should never take things for granted. What? I'm just saying life's short. We shouldn't take things for granted. Are you saying granite? Well, yeah. It's granted with a D. Take things for granted. Did you actually think it was Jesus Christ, Rick? What are you, a boulder rock person? How long have you been saying that wrong? Oh. Oh, you like that, huh? I bet I I bet that really blows your mind. I mean, yeah, it's kind of great. You want me to erase it? What? You can do that? Oh [ __ ] I [ __ ] knew it. You piece of [ __ ] You're you're you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] Rick. Oh, take it easy, Morty. Come on. Just relax. No, I'm not going to [ __ ] relax. Come here. Let go of me, you little [ __ ] Scruffy. Take that. Um, what? What's going on? Where am I? Who are we? Who am I? I think I'm an adolescent boy. Huh? And I'm an elderly man. And we appear to be in some kind of secret confined space. Yeah. Um, don't look at me like that. I'm, for all we know, you could be the [ __ ] weirdo. Huh? These things are obviously storage units. And since we can't remember what went wrong, my guess is that the technology involves memory and that this thing on your head is designed to tell us the code, Jagoff. It's pointless. He's stonewalling. Rick, if we don't unlock those vaccines, Earth dies. You know, it might be time to step up your interrogation. Not sure what you're implying, Morty, but some lines I don't cross. Yeah, well, I crossed every line I had when this bastard tried to kill Jessica. Okay, you see those two fleshy sacks under his chin? Morty, grab them. You remember the codes now? Twist. Give us the codes, man. Twist harder, Morty. harder. Okay, let go. Let go. Let him breathe. He wants to make a deal. Half the codes now, half after you finish. But can't we trust? Wait, what? Finish what? You know. I thought I was torturing him. Oh, and this disappoints you? Do I tell them we don't have a deal, Morty? Because if we could kill our enemies, but we can't jack them off, then how are we better than them? Well, what did you find out? We're partners, I guess, and we fight aliens like Men in Black. Men in Black. Men in Black. I have Men in Black 2 in here. So So you get the general idea. Not quite. It's basically an endless string of callbacks. All right. Save it for YouTube. I'll keep looking for clues. What are you doing? You want your shelf level or not? And if I say yes, you're going to provide that for me with that. Yes. See the bubble? I'm familiar with the bubble, Morty. I also dabble in precision. And if you think you can even approach it with your sad naked caveman eyeball and a bubble of [ __ ] air, you're the reason this species is a failure. And it makes me angry. You're drunk. You want to put up a shelf? Put up a shelf. You want to experience true level? Do you? Yes. All right. Come on. Wow, it's so Oh my god. Oh Christ. Uh yeah, true level, [ __ ] Morty, come on. We're leaving for school. Oh, everything's crooked. Reality is poison. I I want to go back. I hate this. What's his deal? Shorty, Morty, go to school, Summer. I'll go in Morty's memory and do a little lambs to the cosmic slaughter. Well, you seem to be in charge of what I get to remember. Why? Good question. Morty, I need darkness to prime these optical inductors. Hit the leftmost light switch by the door for me. The left. Okay, lights on. So, did I just hear three distinct light switch clicks? What do you mean? I feel like the three sounds I heard could be explained by an initial erroneous flipping of a switch on the right, followed by a hasty corrective flipping of the requested switch, then during the resultant darkness and silence, a third shameful unflipping of the initially flipped switch. Is my assessment accurate? Yeah, that's that's basically how how it all shaked out. I'm sorry. All right. Come on. What? Come on. Grab a shovel. What is that? Grab a shovel. What was that? Can't find a goddamn zip tie anywhere. All right, [ __ ] it. Ah, zip tie. Why are you making me do this for you again? Who doesn't wish they could talk to animals, Rick? Most humans. There, I'm done. Just stay out of trouble. Got to keep moving. Can't stop. Up, down, down, up, up, up, down, down, up, stop, down. The queen needs food. The babies need food. The queen makes babies. The situation in Argentina has proven less convenient than predicted. Well, we'll have to redistabilize their economy, refocus labor class outrage from upper to middle, foster a coup, and install a compliant regime. Same as Guatemala. Yes, but you can double time it. We need a quorum to pick a new pope in case the Exxon Monsanto thing falls through in Africa. Why not use chemtrails? Put a canopy on Uganda. They're set to agitate any mo. What? That kid is watching us. So, we're squirrels. He's a kid. He's watching us like he hears what we're saying. Hey, kid. Young man, come here. Little boy, tell Daffhany to run a 199 on a possible dittle. Little boy, we'll give you wishes if you can hear us. We can make you fly and get candy. Oh, [ __ ] Oh, [ __ ] [ __ ] me. for me. Oh [ __ ] Morty, what did you do? All right, Morty, pack your [ __ ] That's only going to keep him down for a little bit, Morty. You [ __ ] with squirrels, Morty. We got a good 5 minutes before they're backing up on our ass, Morty. We have to pack up and move to a new reality, Morty. You know, we I said we can only do that a couple of times. We're [ __ ] over here because of these damn squirrels. Morty, I don't know what my reaction is, but I think I'm mounting in suspicion of you. Well, what are you going to do? I'm going to remember everything. Everything. Yeah. No. Well, what'd you find out? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you going to do? Kill me? No, I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to kill myself. All those memories just erased, sitting in this room collecting dust. What's the point of going on if most of everything that happens just ends up sitting in here? All right, kid. I don't know much aside from the fact that Men in Black 2 was a joyless cash grab, but I do know that whatever you have brewing around in your noggin really connected with you. I can't deny that. And I can't deny that I'm inspired by your passion. I want in. Suicide packed. Yes. Yeah. Let's do it together, you old son of a [ __ ] On three. One. Two. You guys doing Mort's mindblowers? Morty's Mindblowers? Grandpa, is this a scenario three? Uh, what's that? And who who are you? Oh, man. It's a scenario four. [ __ ] godamn it. I don't get paid enough for this [ __ ] There's a craftsman nearby. I can smell it. Whoa. What? Can I help you? How How did we fall asleep during Interdimensional Cable? Yeah. What the hell, Summer? Summer, you dumb [ __ ] How much of Interdimensional cable did we miss, Summer, you stupid [ __ ] Why did you let us fall asleep, you dumb [ __ ] All right, Morty, [ __ ] this noise. Let's get out of here and go on a classic Rick and Morty adventure. Yeah. All right, Rick. I'm all in. No wonder you're constantly fighting with each other and behind schedule. What? Nothing. Rick, we did it. We We got it. Hurry up, Morty. Get in. Chi, Morty, did you get it? He helped me escape prison. Did you get the ultimate cube? Oh, it's purple. You said it was purple. Said mine was. I didn't know they all were. And now we do. Thanks to Chi-Chi Chachi. So, uh, wh do I get it? Get what? A hug. Let's find a planet with a garden hose first. A dragon. A dragon. You asked me to cut class and fight robots with you. I said no. You said millions of lives depend on it. I said I'll do it for a dragon. You said whatever. I want my dragon. You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds that refuse to admit they're Christian. I want my dragon. Let me give you rocket shoes. Let me give you Wolverine claws. Let me give you a rocket hat. Just be sure to use it with the rocket shoes or it'll rip your head off. I want my dragon. I want my dragon. I want my dragon. Oh crap. Crap. Dad, are you okay? Your ship crashed in Malta. I'm okay. Oh, thank God. Dad, did you promise Morty a dragon? Bleed here and here. I'm not co-leading. Under authority of our treaty twixed the realms of dragon and man. Oh my god, it's my first gay wedding. Summer, I hereby bind this noble serpent and rider at the soul. Here's your tome of dragon spells and lore. That'll have everything you need. Enjoy your dragon. Okay, dragon. Here's the house rule. My name is Baltramar, breaker of sky, slayer of mountain. Rule one, you are now scooper of your own poops or I will take you down like the black light poster you are. I don't got any more rules. That's it. I'm guessing you'd rather not be tagged in this. Okay, I'll bite. What's with a talking cat? It's a dragon, Dipnob. I know that's a dragon. I'm talking about the talking cat in my bedroom. Jerry, why would I give Morty a talking dragon and you a talking cat at the same time? Those concepts bump. If you're talking to a cat, it's an abnormal event unrelated to me. Like when you went to Pluto or my daughter. Okay, there's really no need to get savage. So, he says he has nothing to do with you talking. Told you. So, then why are you talking? Why should that matter? Why should it not matter? How do I know I'm not hallucinating? Rick said this is an abnormal event. You always need Rick to tell you what's going on. Maybe it's time you stopped asking questions and started having fun. Oh, wow. Okay. So, what do you want? I want you to take us to the airport and get us two first class tickets to Florida. Why? I can do that. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is so cool. I await your next command. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nobody's commanding anybody. I love soaring through the sky with you as equals. What do you want to do? I want to enter my lair and sleep upon my horde until the age of man expires. Okay. Split the diff. 20-minute nap and soar through the sky. As you command. Okay. See you soon. This is fun. Yeah, right. What's this show called? Ass. Yeah, it's like Bones, but they solve ass crimes. This ass is a clue. Are these two going to hook up? No. And only the lame fans want that. Don't tell me how to enjoy things. Go to her ass. That's Brener. Go to Brener ass. Honeymoon over already. What's that supposed to mean? Admit it, Morty. Dragons suck. Why don't you admit you don't want anyone else to be happy because you're a sad old fart. How do you saddle a fart? Holy sh Look, I love you ass. I love you, Brener. No. Shh. Oh. And that's the end of the Morty Gets a Dragon episode. Are you going to slay it? First off, I always slay it, queen. Secondly, yes. Should I pause ass? Nah, it's kind of boring now that they're together. Hey, face. You shut the up or at least roll over. Oh no, it burns. Oh my god. Oh, the fire of it all. Oh, if only I had prepared better for this terrifying battle by remembering the only thing dragons are known for. Careful you don't get heartburn. I made that android with a lot of C4. Oh, I'm sorry. I imbued it with a remotec controlled explody potion. You have bested me. I am at your service. Good to be on the same parchment. Now I'm going to tell my grandson you ran off with a low-flying 747 while you pack up your Wait, is this Why do you have an original Ecto-Cooler juice box from 1989? I hoard that which your kind covers. I'll give you 20 bucks for it. Nice try. The hell else are you hoarding down here? Cha-ching. Small soldier spin pops. Don't open that. I'm not an idiot. Hey, why do you have Future self-titled album on vinyl? Look closer. Oh [ __ ] he signed it. Closer. He signed it in Molly and Percoet. I could spend all night down here. Do you indulge in volcanic fuels? Is it going to up my brain? No. I'll do it anyway. Oh, those were not cheap tickets. But um I'm down to clown. Uh why why why can you talk again? It's not important, Jerry. Okay, but why Florida? Because they don't ask questions. They play volleyball. They party. And they have fun. Right. Right. You can do this, Jerry. I can do this. I can do this. Oh, yeah. Hey, Jerry, after this game, come to my yacht and bring your cat. You got it, J. I got to admit, you were right. I've got to tell you something, Jerry. This is the happiest I've ever been in my entire life. Oh, gross. You [ __ ] in the sand. Someone took a small [ __ ] in the sand and buried it with like two little kicks and just left it here like a landmine. Why? And who are you? I'm being summoned by Morty. Oh, yeah. He's uh texting me. How are you responding? Uh, I tend not to. Or maybe I'll send like a popular animated gift that could be interpreted in almost any way. Brilliant. I summon thee. I summon thee, Bramma. What the hell? Taylor Swift pumping her hands in the air. What does it mean when you're lame? Yeah. What's the saying? Orcs work to live. Dwarves live to work. So dumb. If there's ever a saying about me, I'll fly into the sun. You're small for a dragon, Rick. Will I sleep on an extra big pile of awesome [ __ ] Then there will be sayings about you. Your lessons will hunt you down and you will be owned or slain. That's why they call it a dying breed, brother. Oh god, my soul. Oh yeah. I'm I'm I'm a dragon. Yeah. What the Morty? I can explain. Why are you still doing it? Why does it feel better now? I hope it's not because you're watching, but don't go anywhere. Oh, did you fly? You followed the smell of sulfur and skankery. Yeah. Oh, man. This you can take this stupid fake soul bond contract and you can No refunds. Your dragon soul bonded with my grandpa. Oh my. I am so sorry. That is a total violation. Yeah, no [ __ ] I'll take care of this at once. You [ __ ] dragon. You [ __ ] Chill out, dude. That's [ __ ] You don't have shame on you. Shame. You [ __ ] Why the does it feel like you're whipping me? Because your soul got tangled in a dy [ __ ] [ __ ] soul. Let's go. Get through that portal. Grandpa, do something or I will tweet and you will be cancelled. Hey, Dandruff the Gray. Lighten up and give the kid his dragon. By whose command? You have no magic. Yeah, I know. I have actual power. Not here. You don't. True power looks like this. Stone monster. Stick that up your ass. Oh, you're done. I thought the rock monster was here to introduce a physicist. Spinal cord. Activate morphine. Oh, I might be lightning bridge. Okay, he's gone. Listen up. There's probably animals in these hills. If you spare me, I can make your crotch a salt lake. Aana exaka sapulu. Thank you, Morty. Figures you'd be higher status in lame world. Get your together. Lar wrecker. We need to rescue Belramov. Morty, the moral of this story is bros before dragons. Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. If he dies while you're soul bonded, you die, too. Morty, the moral of this story is bros rescue dragons. Both by soul bonding with multiple riders. You have violated the treaty between dragon and mankind. The dragon ary sentences you to hang by the neck until dead. On the count of three. One. Dragonarchy. Two dragon mari two and a half. I just wanted to make sure three grand. What's wrong? Oh god, the wizard must have hung Bramma. Can we go back then? Well, no. No. It takes like 78 years to hang a dragon to death. So man, it's so annoying. You ever like try to swallow a really big vitamin with no water, you know, like really like big one, you know, and and it kind of gets stuck in your throat. It's It's annoying. All right, Morty, go ahead and activate this golem. Aana Akaka Sapulu dumb. All right. Who wants to be infused with like u unreasonable power? Oh, can I be like a sexy arrow shooty lady? Yeah, whatever. There's no rules. I don't care. Morty, you want superpowers? No thanks. I'm fine. I've got my book. All right, good luck with that. Let's go. God. Have you ever had too much orange juice or like you know how egg yolk kind of like gets in your throat and Yeah, we can't. Come on, hurry. We We got to free out from oops. I got this. How's that book working out for you, you dip dumbass? Huh? You know what? You're right. I could get used to this magic stuff. There's Balma. Check this [ __ ] out. Watch this. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Don't even look. Don't even bother looking. Let magic guide your arrow. Summer, what the hell are you doing? Take this seriously. Now, stop trying to pretend like magic involves skill or thought. Summer, make it look like it's coming out of your butthole. Yeah. Yeah. What in the medieval equivalent of tarnation? Jesus Christ. Summer, you [ __ ] idiot. Power of 12 ft. Oh. Ow. I take it all back. I [ __ ] hate magic. [ __ ] thief. You're a [ __ ] thief. Pretty fun boat. Fun people. That's great. Uh, not being asked why I can talk. I'm a talking cat, but who cares why is my point? Well, nice talking to you for no reason. All right, that was a good one. But do you know what a peanut butter gargoyle is? No. What's that, dude? It's when you take the chick, put her feet on a cathedral. Sorry to interrupt, guys. Just want to clarify. Are these real sex positions? Because if they are, how are they gratifying to the male at all? And if the goal is to make something up, why not make up something funnier? I'm asking too many questions, aren't I? How ironic. out of Florida. You over Georgia, you got any money for a cab? Why ask questions? Why not just have fun? I deserve that. Attention, citizens of Dragon, a [ __ ] dragon has escaped. Anyone caught harboring it is also a [ __ ] That's how it It pains me that you can feel my pain. Yeah, how about you suck your dick, which is also somehow my a Why can't couples that start out cheating ever end up happening? Maybe I can find that wizard's portal spell in here and get us home. How about finding the spell that unbinds me from your dragon? No spells can do that. Only the wizard can unbind soul bombs. Uh, who the [ __ ] are you? Who are we? Who the [ __ ] are you, [ __ ] Deborah, stop. We are the [ __ ] dragons. We live in these [ __ ] caves where we suck and eat. And we kindly ask that you leave. If the wizard knows we are here, he will imprison us. Yeah, we like it down here cuz we can woolly mammoths. Get out. Get the out of here, Michael. Michael, you're the only one that [ __ ] that thing. Get the out of here. Well, at least I'm not into play. You Hey, wait. Everybody, stop. Stop. Listen. This is all my fault. I started all this when I tried to control Bramma, and that was up. Nobody should control anyone, especially that guy up there. And um you can eat B if you want. I guess I I got this, Morty. Okay, listen up, [ __ ] dragons. Wouldn't you rather be [ __ ] up there? Have a world instead of a cave? What's wrong with you? This man with a ponytail makes a valid point. All dragons are [ __ ] deep down, even the ones up above. But we would have to kill the wizard to be free. He is too powerful. There is a way to kill the wizard. Oh, who's this mysterious character? Shadow Chucker. You haven't come out of your masturbation cave in eons. It's high time I emerge from my cocoon. I grow tired of eavesdropping and masturbating to the sounds you all make. Jesus Christ. All right. Could use a little more mystery. Oh. Oh, just now seeing the staff. We've never had enough [ __ ] to defeat the wizard. Now with the four fresh wet [ __ ] that just landed on our doorstep, we finally have a chance. So killing the wizard will break my soul bond. Yes, it solves all of our problems. We must begin a 10 [ __ ] soul or wait what? And become the all [ __ ] [ __ ] Phoenix dragon. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. There's got to be something else in here. There's got to be another way. Just give me a second. I haven't read all this yet. Oh my god. Baby, don't tell your parents we did this. Oh, no. Please. No. Ice. Ice. That just made it last longer. Ah, it burns longer. Ah, I could have died fast. Thank you, strangers. Well, it's your world now. Have fun with empowerment. It seems to make everyone that gets it really happy. All right, guys. I'll use this to open a portal. Uh, open a portal to Earth. Get the hell out of here fast. God, look at this piece of [ __ ] Why is there writing on it? Who writes on a portal? Should have taken me up on those Wolverine claws instead. Morty, wait, why did the dragon come? I was thinking we could hang out. Uh, yeah. Whoa, Jesus. Your dad's been texting me this whole time. Uh, he's at an airport with a cat. Okay, that that sounds Wow. You know, I better check on him. Big season finale right there. You know, better uh better go right now. Also, I told you not to get a dragon, Morty. This is your fault. You worst adventure ever. Worst adventure ever. Yeah, I guess you better be on your way, too, Bramma. Well, I've been thinking. What you said back there in the cave really resonated with me. Maybe we could try again. Look, to be honest, I'm kind of grossed out with the sexual nature of how everything unfolded. I didn't know how sexual dragons were. I kind of just wanted to do some D and D stuff, you know, and have a soul orgy with your sister and grandpa and every dragon we could find. Yeah. No. Look, can you please just go? I I I really want a shower. Maybe a quick soul bomb before I go. I'm I I'm good. I think I just need to be alone and sort of unpack all this. What about your grandpa? Would he want to? I can wait. No, I I think you better go. I'm I'm going to take that shower. If it's just warm liquid you want dribbled over your body, I could maybe. No. No. Look, I just want to be clean. I mean, I I I feel dirty after everything that's happened. How about a quick handborn? I like doing it. You're embarrassing yourself. I I'm closing the door. Soul teasers. This is a cool car. I like having fun. That's what I'm talking about. Keep it moving. Don't ask why I can talk. M Uh-huh. For sure. For sure. Where are we going? Quantum radiator might need some nano water. We We can stretch our legs. So, uh, why can you talk? What is this? I need you in one spot for a clean mind scan. Mind scan? Look, you're overthinking it. The point of a talking cat is to have fun. Find the insinuation that I can't ask questions and have fun condescending. You find it condescending, Jerry. Yes. All right. I'm from outer space. Happy? No. Exactly. Because no answer would be satisfying. Because it's a lie. Let's see the truth. What in the Oh, son of a [ __ ] Jerry, don't. I want to see. No, you do not. No, no, no. At least now maybe I'll get the hell out of here. But I've got nowhere to go. Get out. Get out. He was in my home where I keep photos of my parents. Jerry, I have a device. It can make us forget. No, I don't think we should forget. Not this. Someone has to remember. Someone will. Did we crash? Where's the cat? He uh ran away. Did you scan his brain? Yeah. Did you find out why he can talk?

She's not even in your grave. It's a trickle down effect. She'll see me and tell everyone. Okay, time to go. She's juicing. The device makes her cool. Summer, it so strong now, huh? Good luck with intelligence. My turn. Oh. Whoa. That's more like it. Morty, wait till the girls hear this. Let's see if these abs are waterproof. Wow. Smart throw. Damn, really thought out.

How How the [ __ ] Morty messed with my slider and we fell in a pool and everyone booed. Thought the slider was going to be the whole thing this week. Wow. It's not Wow, you Grinch. Why do you care about high schoolers? This is a quad from Total Recall. They're basically the crown jewel of Psychic Mutants. Yeah, everyone knows but me. They [ __ ] shamed me for it. Huh? Water must have fried the gene sequencer. Your spines are braided. Christ, what a mess. You need to fix this, Grandpa. Okay, pay up. What? Pay up, Slice. Thought you killed what you ate. Chore wheel's empty. If you work fast, I'll fix it in the morning. Open your mind. See, Morty gets it. You're worse than he is. Open your mind. God, shut up. Open your mind. What the hell? Open your mind. God damn it, Wordy. You're even messing up my targeted ads. I partied with other quados and had the time of my life. Rules. Whatever. You know what? [ __ ] this noise. Nice quad. Open your mind. Preaching to the choir. Have fun. Oh my go. Your hair quad combo is out of this world. Oh. Uh, wow. I uh I love your tumor face guy. You're hilarious. What'll it be? Open your mind.

Open your mind. Oh, I guess they all say that, huh? You guys celebrating something? Yeah, being quados. We're kind of like VIPs here. Who's your new friend? Quiet. She's cute. This is Summer and Morty. You guys should join us at our table. I mean, if you can handle some rowdy quats, he should come hang. Open your mind. Sounds like we're down to clown. Wow, you guys do this all the time. It's a tight-knit community. Feels like we're part of the future, you know? Yeah, being a mutant is rad. Open your mind. What? Open your mind. Totally. I love being a quad. Who's that guy? Kenneth. He kind of pays for all this. You want to meet him? Obviously, Ken, this is Summer and Morty. They're new to the scene, but they are the real deal. New friends, Champagne. So open-minded of you. We're a rare breed. Open your mind. What? Open your mind. Oh my god, your Kado is so funny. To the future. Uh, you want to get out of here? Hell yeah, I do. This is like the best night I've had in a while. Welcome to life as a quad. Open your mind. Like this whole time I thought my brother was an anchor holding me back, but he's like a key to something I never even imagined. Sounds like he opened your mind. So did you. What's wrong? I'm I'm sorry. Wait. I'm sorry. Like you have a girlfriend or I'm sorry like something much worse. Hold her steady. Hold him steady, too. open mine. Where Morty? [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] What was the activation phrase? Ponytail assemble. Go. Go. Lock. [ __ ] ponytail. I don't give my grandpa enough credit. The oven's mostly for bodies, but I make pizzas in here, too. A dead chief, [ __ ] Sorry. No time to save you more than I just did. Got to find my brother. Jesus. What the hell, Beth? You're paying for those. Just yell my name like normal. I did. Why do you think I risked it with the tongs? Huh? I guess I did drink a lot last night. Marathon of cake or fake? The the sentensient cakes. They they keep you guessing, you know. Where are my kids? Merged. That doesn't answer my question and raises several others. Relax, sweetie. Summer's just doing chores, which I will check on by myself without your tongs. Summer. Summer. Summer. God damn it, sucker. You let them get hungry. Wait, why is this in black and white? For dramatic effect. I didn't design you for dramatic effect. You made me sound like you're dead white. Just color the [ __ ] picture. We're kind of like VIPs here. I mean, if you can handle some rowdy quads, you could join us. I bet you say that to all the mutant girls. He does. Holy [ __ ] I'm just a pretty face. I'm just a handsome guy. Where's Marty? He's He's in a good place. He's happy. It's nice. He's in the taken house. We're going to put him on the highest bidder. Take me to him. He'll kill me. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. He'll do it. So, he wasn't into me. Oh, open. There he is. Man of the hour. How is our big boy? Finally stable. Should be ready for transplant in a few hours. Good. Open your mind. Why do I do it? Have always had a revolutionary spirit. And there's nothing more revolutionary than me being rich. You think anyone in that VIP section was born Aquat? You're a rare breed, Morty, and we're going to put you on someone who values that. Where is she? She paid me, man. She used the taxi app. I make less than minimum wage and I got five kids. Sorry, man. I guess I got really excited to beat someone up for information. Where'd you take her? Come on. Where is she? She just ordered a drink. I spent a long time mixing it. She didn't even tip. [ __ ] Sorry. Wrong guy again. Thought I'd be better at this. Whatever you say, man. Just don't hit me again. Who'd she leave with? Where is she? I'll never tell you. Oh, okay. You actually know. Wait, wait, wait. Isn't that why you're punching me? It is now. What did you do to her? Where is she? [ __ ] man. Right there. Grandpa. Oh, Summer. Okay, awesome. Who's this hot guy who trafficked you? I'm quiet. I'm kind of on a roll. Can I? Oh god. No. No. No. How'd you get here first? I guess even when I'm bad, I'm still pretty good. So, what's Morty saying to you? Where is he? What? How would I know? You didn't form a psychic link. No, we didn't form a psychic link. What the [ __ ] is that? It's like the whole thing. Crown jewel of psychic mutant summer. You used him to get with cool kids, but didn't even activate your powers. It's kind of a quad's whole deal. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. All right. So, how do I hear him? Open your mind, Summer. Christ. Hello, Morty. Morty. Summer. Summer, is that you? Morty, I can hear you. Thank [ __ ] Christ, you [ __ ] I've been screaming for hours. All right. Well, I don't have to hear you. Sorry. And I'm sorry about the froth party. I I think they're selling me, Summer. Hurry. They're selling him, Grandpa. Well, obviously. You don't have to do this. What we had was real. Prepare to get opened. Don't shoot. I didn't tell him anything except where and how to find you. He's outlived his usefulness. Kill him. Oh [ __ ] Psychic warfare. What? Hold on. Grandpa's got this. Oh [ __ ] Run. Whoa. Psychic Grandpa. No. Look. Fake temple with a high-pitched noise maker. Run before these guys figure it out. He's a fake. You morons. Like most psychics. Kill them. Summer, I'm coming. Morty, where are you? I don't know. They're moving me. I'm on the move. This next one comes with a hat. Oh [ __ ] That's what Froth is about, [ __ ] Oh, frisbee plus golf. I get it now. Summer, hurry. Open your mouth. Where do you think they got that one? Whose chest is that big? We don't have time for this. Hey, why do you get to kick down all the doors? I want to kick one. Oh [ __ ] it's locked. My ankle. What is this? Your first taken? [ __ ] you, Summer. I rescue Morty seven times per season. Summer boat. Morty, I see it. I see the boat. Here, Summer, check this out. Check this out. Yeah. Window jump. Try to say it's my first take in now. It's your first take. I'm getting my groove back. You heard him, boys. Kill him before he gets his groove. [ __ ] None of this would have happened if you just unmmerged us when I asked. Morty gets everything for free. Morty's a dog. People have cats because their affection is earned. I treat you like an equal because I respect you. You remind me of your grandmother. What? What? No, I said what? Oh, you're getting choked. Go, go, go. Ponytail. Secret move. Oh my god. Why is hair stop? I need you to remove that. Ungrateful. How's Morty? Morty, you okay? Sorry, I just killed a guy with my hair. No, I'm not okay. I'm still on the boat. Hurry. Open. Open your mind. Sedate him. We're meeting his buyer in an hour. Ow. Open your mind. Easy there. It'll all be over soon. Oh [ __ ] Bite me twice. Shame on me. Oh man. Eject me once. Sir, they're inbound. What should we do? Kill them, idiot. There are days and there are days. Kenneth, you're the crown jewel of psychic [ __ ] Quite an entrance. Now for mine. That's the reveal. You slide off. You think I'm done revealing. That's right. It's me, a smaller quatau, the mastermind behind it all. I sold out my own kind, and I knew it again. Wow. Who could have seen that coming? I mean, he can talk. That's kind of surprising. Yes. Everyone always assumed the charming Kenneth was the brains or perhaps his quto. But I was in control. Morty. Damn, Morty. Big air. Everyone. Open your mind. You want to die? You little [ __ ] Whoa, he's got a knife. Not just any knife. Quotto knife. What? I don't care. Oh [ __ ] It has missiles. You think this is a joke? You're about to die, so I'll let you in on my true secret. Those last three guys were chumps. I'm the real top dog. Oh [ __ ] Is that three or four? I've lost count. But wait, if you're dazzled now. Okay, I see where this is going. Man, kind of a shame. That spider thing was pretty cool. Yeah, I wanted it. Morty says he wanted it. Oh, okay. Here. Oh, whoops. You got to jiggle it more. Obviously, I'm jiggling it, Summer. Well, not hard enough. Morty says not hard enough. Uh, I must have it set up for motion smoothing. I got to upgrade the polling rate. Jesus, what are you a lifeguard? Just jiggle it. I'm alive. I'm alive. Wait, I have so much more to reveal. There we go. Oh yeah, this is great. Whoa, Morty, looking good, bro. You're actually like a [ __ ] boss. Wait, can that thing jump? Oh my god. Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, and the Harry Hes win. Yeah, Morty, that's a part. Open your mind. Hey, did you see that par? Morty's killer out there. Yeah, he's not even using his missiles. Speaking of, I kind of need a new girl to hook up with on Tuesdays. Eh, pass. Hey, you want to get out of here? Tots. Summer saved me from being trafficked and burned alive. Like, whatever. Damn, Summer Smith, there is no end to your complexity. There's the missiles. Open your mind. Open. Mom, we're going to miss the movie. No, we're not. Okay, but we've been here for hours. I I don't want to hang out at the stupid horse hospital. The stupid horse hospital puts dinner on your table. Wouldn't kill you to take an interest. What's this thing in the middle of the room with with the hole in the end? That's a breeding mount. The nurses use it to collect reproductive material. Okay, let's go see this latest piece of Marvel [ __ ] you kids are [ __ ] over. Yeah, about time. So, does your hospital ever need like after school volunteers? Wow. Who are you and where did you put my son? No, no, seriously. I I'm very interested in in your work. Morty, you dirty little doggy. Come on. Hey, Rick. Oh, hey kiddo. How's your Saturday? Yeah, super chill. What you doing? Yeah, nothing adventurous. You know that race of underground dwelling cannibal horse people that were always fighting? Yeah, the Chuds. What about them? Well, don't tell anybody, but I'm working on a boweapon to use against them. So, I got this barrel of horse semen from your mom's hospital, and I'm just gonna, you know, subject it to some other worldly forces. Guess I should test it and make sure it's make sure it's what? Horse semen, obviously. Okay, but it says it is right on the barrel. You're being very scientific, Morty. Measure twice, cut once, especially with semen. You even ask mom if you could have this, Morty. If I wanted to steal horse semen, I'd Yes, I asked her. What is at stake for you here? Why don't you trust labels? All right, fine. I won't test it. God damn, your generation really picks random hills to die on. Don't get too close. I'm running an inhuman amount of power through this seaman. Should be safe though since the seaman itself is, you know, also inhuman. Here we go. What? What happened? The sperm, Morty, there's super monster sperm now. I blame myself. Unless there was something about the sperm I didn't know. Are are you saying that to mess with me? What? Mess with you? How? Like trying to get me to say something? I have no idea what you're talking about. For real? Yes. Okay, good. Then then it's your fault. Dad, what the hell is going on? Beth, sweetheart, can you give me a minute? I'm trying to steer around the bodies of our neighbors. That felt like Jean. That's on you, Beth. Dad, I swear. Well, it's it's not Rick's fault. It's space sperm. What? Yeah, space sperm. I I've seen them before, but never like this. Space sperm. Sperm from space. Very impressive verbal forensic work, Jerry. Holy [ __ ] How big are spaces? Don't answer that. Damn, they must be huge. Oh [ __ ] Oh [ __ ] [ __ ] Mr. Sanchez, the president is very eager to speak with you. Morty, look, you got to do me a solid here. You want me to keep the secret of where these things came from? Yes, technically it's a lie, but I messed up and I'm embarrassed cuz it's, you know, science. No problem. I got your back, dog. Really? Okay, cool. Thanks, Morty. I thought that'd be a harder cell. You did a shameful thing. Dwelling on it isn't going to help, you know. Am I right? Sometimes you just got to wipe it off, toss it in the trash, and head back to study hall. I'm not getting the metaphor, but I'll take your hall pass. Searchers, get the hell in here. Space sperm. Jesus, how big are Space Digs? Same page club. Well, Mr. President, the theory of cosmic DNA has been around for decades. Chupacabbras, Yeti, Stonehenge, ancient Rome. Are these all myths, monsters, legends, or different names for sperm from outer space? I'll tell you what I think, Sanchez. I think either you caused this mess or is those godforsaken horse people that dwell underground? That's them. If they're behind this, so help me God. Morty, you've always been a straight shooter. You can't prove that. Wait, what? Oh. Oh, right. I can protect you, little man. Blow that whistle. Toot toot. Is this your grandpa's fault? Here's what I know, sir. This is the greatest country on earth. It invented apple pies and lasers. Keep talking. And that sperm, we don't know nothing about it. Then the Chuds just got themselves a war. And you just dodged a personal drone strike. Hello. Hello. Sorry I'm late. This is Professor Shaboo, the world's leading expert on sperm. Thanks for getting here so fast. My schedule was wide open. I have been tracking our new sperm friends since their arrival. If my calculations are correct, they have gathered here. Why would the sperm go to the Grand Canyon? Why are you looking at me like the answer is obvious? You can't be serious. Are we in middle school? You think sperm are instinctively heading for America? Don't high road us, lady. It's where they went. No. How do we deal with these orgas goblins? No takers. Okay. These couple stilts. No. Dumb. These um escape boogans. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Escape booans. Really? Escape booans. We'll use it as a placeholder and beat it later. Mr. President, if I may. Luckily, I was able to secure a specimen. Now, obviously, our first steps will be to analyze its DNA and figure out what these beautiful Oh, why? It It had a gun. Are you out of your mind bringing an armed sperm in here? They can't hold guns. The boy literally never lies. Look, if you want these things gone, give Rick and me a plane and some nukes. We'll wipe them out and leave no trace of them. Only one way to deal with it. He's right. I'm a scientist. Fair enough. Blow him to hell. What are people going to do? Complain we made the canyon grander? Jerry, we're being bad parents. Do something. Is this water for everyone? Yes, and I'd love a glass. Coming up. What are you doing? And Rick, to make sure you don't screw anything up, I'm sending my best men with you. And women. It's a fine suggestion, but I doubt their leader will be a sexy queen that needs to be kickboxed. 100% male Marines. They say cutting a sperm's throat is like running a warm knife through butter. I'm going to make these things pregnant with death. No fear, no humility. Zero chance of consequences. Hey, gentleman's bet. Which of these background marines you think will last the longest? I'm not betting on human lives, Rick. All of these people are going to survive. But obviously that guy the longest. Yeah, he's my pick, too. What's his name? Blazen. Pretty cool. Yeah, he's like meditating through turbulence. I bet if something fell, he'd like catch it without opening his eyes. Totally. Should we throw something at him? I got a pencil somewhere. Who's shooting at us? Oh, wow. That's unexpected. The sperm made a catapult. Are they getting smarter? No, you're getting dumber because that's a trebuche. Nobody knows the difference. They're reloading that textbook trebuche. Time to fly. We got to keep moving. So cool. Not even a scratch. Okay, girls. And I mean that derogatorily. We just took a fat L and what we need is a fat P. A plan. I take the lead here. You two watch the flanks. Blazing. Bring up the Hey, please. One person draws the plan. Skaters. Japers. Troopers. I'm sorry, but what the hell are we calling them? Fine. I'm dying, so I get to pick the name. Crispy Creams with a se Whoa. Easy there, little guy. It's okay. It's okay. Do you recognize me? Do you know you came from me? I'm Morty. I'll call you Sticky cuz you're Sticky and and you're stuck. Step aside, Morty. It's okay. You don't got to do this. Hloid genetic code, Morty. A biological fertilizing machine. What's gotten into you, Rick? Let him go. Morty, don't [ __ ] with me. What the hell's going on with you? I think I know exactly what's going on here. Kidding. This [ __ ] is totally random. Let's keep moving. What? Which way? When one sense is bound, the others are released. Holy [ __ ] He He can smell caves. I'm not trying to smell anything. The whole planet's a dorm room trash can. Sir, Rick Sanchez has gone dark. I knew we couldn't rely on him. Oh, maybe the pilot got too horny as they approached America's vagina. If you're going to hang out in my war room, you can't just make snarky comments. At least do something useful like Jerry. Right to the top. Just the way you like it. Here's our situation. Rick's gone and so are all our nukes. Now what? None of you have an idea. I do. That's right. Me, the girl. Gentlemen, what do sperm want? The same thing as a lumberjack in the morning or a fox at night. Pants. Eggs. Pancakes. Eggs. You want to control giant sperm, you need a giant egg. Wait, wait a minute. Wait, wait a minute. Sperm are hunters. And now what do sperm hunt? Eggs. Exactly. And what would happen if we enlarged one? They'll head right for it. Get MIT on the phone and get this guy a Nobel Prize. He became a woman today. So Blazen, you got kids? The battlefield is my family. So badass. Go. I'll hold him off. Blazing. You don't have to do this. It is my destiny. He's right, Morty. It's the price of being Blazen. Let him do his thing. Blood for blood. Cream for cream. Oh no. I can't reach that idiot. What? They're comfortable. You should try them. Oh, that'll do it. I'm worm food. Morty, find my wife. Tell her I wasn't wearing her thong. That's a photocopy of Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Kathy Ireland. It's It's my wife. We have sex. Here, hold that picture up so we can have sex one last time. I I know how to suck myself. What? So wrong about this guy. He didn't even buy us any time. Morty, get ready for some fireworks. Oh. Oh, gross. This is the first time I've ever regretted being taken alive. Wait, who the [ __ ] is that? Silence in the presence of me. I am the sperm queen. And you are of special interest to me. Hey, what the [ __ ] are you doing with my stuff? And why? Why do you have the horse jerkoff machine for my daughter's hospital? We need it to create our army. Well, you need more than that, dummy. You need a horse. Oh, but our stallion is already here. Isn't that right, Morty? Or shall I say, father? Morty, you nasty lying little worldending pervert. I'm I'm sorry. What was it like? Fantastic. Rick, I'm sorry. I I just thought maybe I could have repeated sex with a horse machine without it becoming Armageddon. I I realize that's on me. Yeah, not exactly accepting apologies while I'm stuck here as hand job solo. This is all your fault for being ashamed of us, Morty. How many millions went to their graves for you? hurling themselves into the void only to discover a grody sock or carefully folded landing strip of toilet paper. How do you know all this? Oh, honey, because we're the very essence of you. We are your shame incarnate. And once we're through with you, our sperm army will take over the world. Put them on the machine. Rick, do something on it. What did you do? I got out of your ey line. Oh no. Oh yes. The end is near. Any last words? No. Sticky. Gross. I know you're not a wordssmith, Morty, but No, no, no. My my my sperm friend is here. Look, never give him a name. You can't beat me. You didn't bring a woman that could kick. Is that all you got? Damn, that's some quintessential underdog [ __ ] Kill them. Yeah. Woohoo. I should have told you the truth, Rick. Let's save the world first. Now, reset those nukes and let's turn this canyon into a cantion. They're usually earthquakes in Arizona. They're heading for Vegas, which does track on many levels, but why now? What the Let's hear it with Professor Cevu and his brilliant egg. Um, hello. Aren't you forgetting someone? A good point. Big thanks to the cast of Circus Ole Zumanity for the impressive and erotic routine. Mr. President, Rick Sanchez is on the line. Good. Put that [ __ ] on speaker. Well, well, well. No thanks to you. We're luring the sperm with a giant human egg. Even though symbolically speaking, Vegas should be enough. A human egg? Where did you get it? Glad you asked. It's your granddaughter's. So, at least you contributed something to this. Mr. President, it's Morty. It's my sperm. It's all mine. What? I'm a dirty little perverted maniac. I spent a week pleasuring myself with animal equipment, and my sperm got turned into monsters on accident because I kept lying about it. Because I was ashamed. You should be. My god, man. We were all 14 once. But it's called self-control. Don't let them reach my sister's egg. Mr. President, you'll be making a giant incest baby. What? Who told you that? What? I I was finishing a sentence. Oh, right. Come with us. The sperm is Morty's. We're about to make a giant incest baby. A Well, now we're all in our darkest hour. Launch the egg. Launch it now. But that'll take 30 minutes. What? Why? That's how long every space launch takes. No one realizes it because they only show you the last 10 seconds. Uh, help me out here. Hey, it was your idea, right? Okay. Okay. No need to panic, everyone. I have a simple solution. See you all in hell. I don't see how that's going to help. Form a perimeter. Protect that egg at all costs. I always knew your hormones would cause a world war between humans and cannibalistic horse people. I just didn't know it would be like this. I can't change my nature. What are you, a scorpion in a Navajo fable? Everyone can change their nature, Morty. It's what defines our species. Look at Iron Man. That actor was an animal in the '90s. Literally waking up in bushes. His agent had to catch him with a butterfly net. Silence. Rick Sanchez. You know why you're here. Yeah, it was my grandson's fault. You slept with my daughter. I did? Oh [ __ ] I did. Forgive me. You're chudness. I'm a changed man starting now. You come to the kingdom of chuds for forgiveness. Chuds don't forgive humans. Chuds eat humans. This is out there even for us. They can hear you, Morty. up. Yum, yum. Slice it right. Oh boy. Eat the flesh. Yum, yum, bones. Father, stop this at once. Princess Ponetta, you can't kill Rico. I I love him. Right. I I love you too, Princess Ponetta. This love is forbidden. My daughter, you are a chud. Rick is a human and age inappropriate. Then you leave me no choice. By the 17th article of the Chudstitution, I offer Rico Sanchez horse immunity and demand an equestriuse between all chuds and humans. On what grounds? On the grounds that Rico is the father of my child. I have an error. I have a substance abuse problem. The prophecy has come true. Also, did someone drop a scroll? Here we go. Over here. Sorry. Where did you get all that? It's Vegas. Sir, the strip has been evacuated, but I'm worried we won't be able to hold the perimeter. Then deputize Las Vegas regulars. Everyone's a patriot today. Even me. Take three steps back, Amazing Jonathan. Men and their guns. Metaphorical and not. Tell me about it. Get ready, boys. The last thing this world needs is a giant incest, baby. Roar through. Nice. Do not let a single sperm get through to that end. Um, should we be concerned about that scary bomb laden one? Honey, let the men handle this. I think we know a thing or two about ready for all of the responsibility with none of the credit. Let's Nancy Reagan this [ __ ] Damn it. We can't stop them. We don't have the manpower. What about horsepower? Sweet Lady Liberty. That son of a mayor Rick has ended our centuries long war with the Chubs. Rico, the hoopless, they need us. Let's do this. Shuttly duty ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Mom, I promise to use condoms even when it's butt stuff. Okay, we have a lot to talk about tonight. Is this your heart? It's a play on. Is this your card? You don't have a heart. But this is probably some kind of organel in charge of pumping endopplasmic reticulum throughout your membrane and therefore relative to you functions as a heart. So I ask you again, is this your heart? Morty, look. I won't just be thrown away. Rick, the egg is mine. Vicki, it's all you, bud. Sticky. [ __ ] We got a heartbeat. Screw that. That's a human life. And this is an election cycle. You have to do something. Nope. It's face's problem now. Oh, this sucks. Your Sports Illustrated Kathy Ireland. You were with my husband, Blazen, when he died. Please tell me, was he wearing my thong? He probably told you not to tell me. He was ashamed of it, but he didn't need to be. I hope he was wearing it. Always be honest. Sometimes it will hurt people. Sometimes it will help, but always be honest. Huh? Yeah. Yeah, he he was wearing it. Ew, that gross animal pig. So, trying to boil this all down, I want to say it's important. Shut up, Morty. I got my own epilog. Oh, Rico, I love you. Prove it. Oh, I love kissing those big old horse teeth. It's like licking tile. I swear it's time someone made an honest man out of me. Whatever you need. The whole nine yards. You got it. The thing is, Ro, it's time. Oh [ __ ] Oh [ __ ] It's time. Oh my god. It's wonderful. Oh wow. So we don't have to, you know, raise it? Nah, they're ready to go right out of the box. Cool. Cool. So bye. Yep. Take care of yourself, Rick. Yep. Same. Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator. That is multi-phase quantum resonator. Well, does it defraculate? No. Then then then it's a broken defraculator. Like you would even know dick about fraculation. Your planet just got cell phones and the coverage still sucks. Yeah. Yeah. And your species eats sulfur. So let's say 60 smidgens. I'll tell you what. I I'll do you a favor. I'll throw in a fart. Hey, uh Rick. Um you think maybe I could get something from this place? Like like a souvenir? Like like just to have like something cool, you know? Not here, Morty. We'll stop somewhere else because you know there's always another pawn shop. Oh, okay. I just um you know I thought that robot over there looked pretty cool you know. Oh it looks cool, huh? That's why you want it. Yeah. You know I mean it's different from the stuff on Earth and you know you you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy and you know I don't really have anything to to remember all those trips by. It'd be kind of cool like a souvenir. You know like what if you passed away or died or something? I wouldn't even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did you know. Okay. 60 for the resonator and my grandson wants the sex robot. So, we're just going to pretend this isn't happening. I'm not saying that's a bad idea, just asking. Rick, why would you let Morty bring that thing into our house? What do you want from me? He He thought he thought he he thought it looked cool. You know what I mean? All right. Back to back to back back upstairs. Well, I'm intervening. Intervening with puberty. You'll turn him into Rafe Fines and Red Dragon. He's at that age. Let's just be proud of him. Jesus, did I really set the bar that low? Um, Rick, could you come with me, please? Quickly. Okay, now if we hear squeaking, we intervene. Where's the sex robot? Morty, that is Gwindalin. I I mean the robot. She started beeping and then transformed and tried to fly away. Strange. That's usually the man's job. You know what I'm talking about, Morty. Wubbled. Morty. That's my catchphrase. Remember Remember how I how I cemented that catchphrase? All right. All right. Seriously though, let me grab this thing. Come on. Okay. Unacceptable. What is going on? All right. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. What is that? I think Mort's robot was designed for more than long weekends. Genetic compiler incubation chamber. Yep. This here's some kind of baby maker. And that there's half Morty, half who who knows what. It's my bad, guys. I'll I'll I'll take care of it. What do you think you're doing? Hey, listen. You guys quarantined the house when summer brought olives back from Mexico. I mean, this thing could grow to the size of Delaware. I mean, it it might eat brains and exhale space aids. We got to be careful. I lost a chance to be careful, Rick. I'm a father now. You know, it's time for me to be responsible. Isn't that right, Morty Jun? Crap. He named it. Well, Dad, it's a living thing and it's half human. And it was born on American soil, which entitles it to Jerry. Majoring in civics was your mistake. Don't punish us for it. Fine. I'm going to take this thing to my workshop and do a little bit of investigating. Do not let that thing out of your sight. It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous, like the insane clown posi. Yeah, good one, Jerry. 2003 just called it wants its easy target back. Oh, he's like a little me. You You don't think he'll turn into a monster, do you? I always do. Hey, uh uh 1995 call. They want their certain year called wanting its blank back formula back. Why, Jerry? Why expend the effort? Life is effort and I'll stop when I die. Out. What you doing? Well, I can't solve the problem my way thanks to your family's primitive biological hang-ups. Gross. I might have just touched one of Morty's loads. But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr. on this robot's home world, which is Gazorpor in the Andromeda system. Scoot, Summer. Don't you need a new companion now that Mort's in the family way? I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer. Oh, right. Because there's something about having a wiener that would make me better at walking through a hole. Oh crap. Help! Help! Grandpa Rick, still think it's a good idea to go through holes without a wiener. I want to go home. Yeah, no duh. Great. Now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs. You're doing great, Morty. Really? You think? I mean, I'm not doing much of anything. What do I do if it cries? Then you put it down and let it cry itself out. Yeah, right. We tried that technique on Summer and she's going to end up stripping, isn't she? Yes, she is. She's going to strip her attention because she was denied it. Stop filling it with your own insecurity. You're going to turn it into more uh more more of you. Well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally ill scientist. What the hell? Listen to me. I am not rewarding this behavior. Knock it off, both of you. Give me them. Give me my baby. You're both nuts. I'm going to raise Morty Junior myself. Where's your hands? There's your hands. And that's how we play. Handy hands. Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty. At least we can agree on that. Thanks, Dum Dum. I said, ""Thanks, Dum Dum. Go get more."" Summer, put your burka on. That burka is a human rights violation, and I spent a lot on this top. Look, I'm trying to repair a portal gun with a bunch of sex doll parts, and I have to do it one-handed to keep these belies from carting you off. The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender. What's the deal with this place? Why is it such a sausage planet? And how did such backward idiots invent robots? Obviously, at some point, the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines. The resultant lack of distraction and henpecking allowed them to focus entirely on war. So, they bombed themselves back to the stone age and now they just fight with each other over fake with sticks and rocks all day long. You think it's efficient to get rid of women? You ever see a line for the men's room? Are you Do you hear me, Summer? The blood plot thickens. You might want to cover your eyes, Summer. Yeah, like it was my dream to watch. Yeah, baby. Summer, grab grab hold. Yeah, baby. Grandpa Rick, where are we going? Well, obviously, Summer, it appears the lower tier of the society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class. Sound familiar? Ticket master. Oh, there there we go, Summer. Hey, hey, brother. Hey, hey, hey, bro. Nice racket you got going on here. Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from Earth Dimension C137. Don't mean you any harm. Coming in peace. It's all cool in the uh good in the neighborhood is what I was trying to come is what I meant. Oh, I get it. The old behind every great man Amazon twist. Silence. Your slave is ill-mannered. My slave. We assume you are from a more primitive world where men are still permitted to be servants. If he is a rogue male, tell us now and we will kill him. He's my slave. He's my slave. He's definitely my slave. Oh boy. What's the opposite of wubble up a dubdubs? Am I right, ladies and gentlemen? You guys kidding me? Oh, Morty Jr., you're going to be a special little guy, aren't you? Oh, yeah. You're my special little guy. Oh, Dad. What was that, Morty Jr.? Were you Were you going to say dada? Say dada. Death. Dada. Domination. Um, dada. Destruction. Domination. Nice. The spider in sector C is still alive. Plan your route accordingly and expect delays. We're not telling you what to do. We're just sharing how we feel. And now weather. Is anyone else cold or is it just me? I am Marsha, ruler of Gazorazorp. I am here if you need to talk. What is this place? Paradise. We built it during the great passive aggression when the females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior. I am here if you need to talk. I am here if you need to talk. From here we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population. Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery. The females are placed into educational programs where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most. The males, they get to play outside. That was just a baby. And within a day, he'll be an adult male gazorpion. One of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe. Wait a minute. We're here because a male gazorpion was born on our planet. You speak when you're spoken to, Dingling. It's true, though. One of your babies was born on Earth. Are you the ruler of this Earth? How did you know? the quality of your talk. Do you love it? I love it. I am here if you need to talk. I'm here. I am here if you need to talk. I am here if you need to talk. If the Gazorpion is male, your Earth is in grave danger. We will give you passage back home so it can be terminated. But first, mojitos. We don't have time for mojitos. You are insulting them. I don't care, Summer. This place is the worst. I want to go home. Well, it really doesn't matter what you want because this is a sane place where women rule. Yeah. You know what I have to say about that? I cannot believe my ear is I Woo boy. Who let the frogs out? Huh? Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa. Patriarchal. Father of fathers. Then this one is not your slave. And your Earth is yet another planet dominated by men. It's not dominated by us. Okay. On Earth, men and women are equals. Equals. We make 70% of your salary for the same job. seize them. Is this really the time to make that point, Summer? This is for you, Daddy. Oh, man. Um, okay. Listen to me, Morty Jr. I got to tell you something very important, okay? Killing is bad. Bad. You're silly, Daddy. No, Morty Jr., I'm being serious, okay? You need to put your energy into something else. I mean, what about dancing? Would you like to learn how to dance? I would like to dance on the grays of my enemies. No, Morty Jr. Daddy, can I go outside? No, absolutely not. But that's where all the people and the animals are. Yeah, but you can't go out there because the the air is poisonous for you. You will die if you'll die instantly if you ever leave this house. You hear me? For real. For real. Times a million, buddy. So, let's just stay inside and, you know, let's try dancing, right? Look at me. Yay. Look, we're going to dance. Come on. Join. Dance with me here. We love to dance. Why do we love to dance? Because I said so. Nice. Nice. So, what are you in for? Because I got I got a big, you know, penis between my legs. What What are you in for? The worst crime a female can commit. Veronica Anne Bennett, I find you guilty of having bad bangs. You ever notice the ones with bad bangs always have three names? You are hereby sentenced to the silent treatment. This is going to be cake. No, Jackie. Rick and Summer of Earth for the crimes of treason against womankind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak because it does not exist. You are hereby sentenced to What? What? What? What? A night on the couch? Death. Gerp. I hate you so much right now. This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness. So, we are forced to improvise. We placed a large boulder on that ledge. Holy [ __ ] You You're going to crush us with a boulder? No. Stop interrupting. The boulder falls onto a lever that will launch knives. What? Just give me a gun. I'll kill myself. Stop interrupting. The knives will Fine. You were right the first time. Okay. The boulder crushes you. I just didn't want to admit you were right. Happy? No, just ignore them. Ignore them. Such an [ __ ] Look, I'm sorry, Summer. I feel bad that I let you drag us into this. I wish I could have been a better grandpa to you. And you know, for what it's worth, it's that is a really nice cute top that you're wearing there. Top. My top. My top. The same top you complimented earlier. Look. Look at the tag. Read it. It says Mark. Jacob's Mark. Jacob. These are names of the penis. Yes, an Earth man made this top. Maybe on your planet, separation of the genders is the right thing to do, but on Earth, a certain percentage of our males are born gay, which is why my clothes are better than all of yours. It's true. And sometimes the truth hurts, but it must be accepted. Like if I told you that you're using the wrong color foundation for your skin, and it ends at your neck, making you look like a party clown. Okay. Ouch. Noted. But the fact remains, if you impose Gazorpazorp's laws on Earth, you're no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken. And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute. Very well. Give the Earth people a spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet where women are kind of equal, but not really. Good job, Summer. And thanks, girls. You know, you girls are really something. I'll tell you that. You know, when we first got here, I was like, give them a ship now. Wardy Jr. smoking. That is not okay. What are you going to do? Ground me? I can't go outside anyway. So what? You could do things inside. I mean, you could play guitar. You could masturbate. I don't want to masturbate. I want to conquer the planet. Oh, here we go again. You know who do you think is going to love you if you conquer the planet, Morty Jr.? Love. That's all you care about? What about weapons? What about domination of the enemy? All right, that's it. No more History Channel. This TV is for cartoons and video games only. I hate video games. You take that back. Give it to me. I I didn't mean I didn't mean that. I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry. I can't take this anymore. I'd rather breathe poison than live another minute with you. No. No. No. No. Stop. My life has been a lie. God is dead. The government's lame. Thanksgiving is about killing Indians. Jesus wasn't born on Christmas. They moved the date. It was a pagan holiday. Oh, Dad. Yes, Morty. My son is going to take over the planet, and I am too young to drive. Can you help me get him back? I suppose, Morty. I suppose. But first, a deep sip from a very tall glass of I told you so. Oh my god. Please, Dad. Come on. Running wild, running hot, burning inside with the youth and the blood and the age and the heat and the fire and your pants are too wide. You're going to run from the devil, but you can't run from your youth. Oh, Dad. There he is. Oh god. Hey, stop that. Oh my god. Oh my god. Dead. Morty Junior, no. It's me. It's dad. It's okay. Put the car down, Morty Jr., no. No. Where Where's your hands? Where's your hands? My car. And that's how we play Handy Hands. Out of the Out of the way, Morty. No. Morty. That's one of the most violently aggressive creatures in the universe. Ow. He's my son. And if you hurt him, you you have to kill me. Rick, Dad, I'm so confused. I know, Morty Jr., I'm sorry. I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me. You know, parents are just kids having kids. One minute you like how a shiny robot looks, the next minute you're in a fist fight with your alien son. I'm an alien. We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts. We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive. But I want to murder everyone I see. Well, you know, I mean, maybe there's a job out there for people that feel that way. Actually, there is. Hi, I'm Brad Anderson, creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip Marmaduke. You should consider being a creative. I'm haunted by uncontrollable thoughts of mutilation and sexual assault on a near daily basis, but you know, I channel it all into my work. Oh, wow. Huh? I never got that impression from reading Marmaduke. Well, did you get the impression I was trying to make you laugh? Tell me that wasn't Brad Anderson. Oh, see you hear that, Morty Jr.? Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind. Maybe. I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of the novel. I mean, what I really want to do is slip people's throats, but beyond that. I know you can do it, son. I think it's time I get a place of my own. I promise I'll call you every day I need money or a place to do laundry. So, I assume this novel your son writes is going to pay for my rear axle. Isn't it interesting, Summer, that after all that stuff we just did, nothing really mattered and there was no point to it? Kind of makes you wonder, huh, about nothing? Are you sure it doesn't make you re-evaluate your policy about taking girls on adventures? No. I'd say given what we've been through that I was right the whole time and any epiphies about gender politics were a projection of your feminine insecurity. But hey, why don't you have a pink spaceship? Go ride around and have a jolly old time. Maybe that'll shut you up. Dad Summer, where were you guys this whole time? I'm Gazorbizorb. Where were you? I was reading a newspaper. Oh, that's interesting. Beth, you know, it's funny. Uh, I I heard about a little bit of news as myself. Take a look. Take a listen. Well, dubdubs this world still got a still got a chance. Yeah. See See you guys next week. The FL globy Pay up. What? Pay up, G Slice. I just finished your chores. Didn't I just upgrade your ponytail? And those ghost goggles you asked for in the vending machine. Attribute slider. Oh [ __ ] Yeah, Jimmy Hocker's frisbee golf party is tonight. I want him sliding all over these attributes. Ow. Sensitive bone marrow much. All right. What are we boosting? What are we losing? Strength me up, dog. I want that frothbod. Drop intelligence. All right. Four customizable stats courtesy of the genetic sequencer. Come here. No, Summer. I will literally murder you. Oh, Christ. You're too dumb to know I'm serious. Hey, Rick, what are you? Wait, is that an attribute slider? You're juicing your stats for the froth party. You're going to ruin this for me. What? No. I I want one for the party, too. Do some [ __ ] for me, bro. I I I helped you kill your nemesis. Oh, you guys found him. It's my emotional cheat day. I am removing myself from this conversation. I can't believe he gave you that. I I've asked for one forever. Cuz you're a bottom feeder, Morty. You beg and eat scraps. I'm an independent woman who eats what she kills. Come on, Summer. I I'm your little brother. You You have to take care of me. Take care of this. You just hide anywhere, huh? Kick his ass, Summer. Oh my god. Who are you? Yeah, but what about this? Shut up. Bro, is that your sister? Her dexterity is wild. Yeah, I guess. Hey, Brad, aren't you a football guy? Of course, Morty. But the off season is the froth season. Yo, Summer, get over here and meet the team captain. Oh, hey guys. So random seeing you here. Love the way you move that coin. Ever consider a bigger disc? Is your hair different? Oh, I don't know. I started using this new leave-in conditioner. I love it. Maybe leave your number in my phone. So charismatic. Looks like we found our new center forward back. Gross. She's just using tech to customize herself for social situations. Bro, maybe you should, too. You're harsh in the buzz. Can you give us a sec? Oh, hey. You're embarrassing yourself. Leave or I will make you leave. Just let me borrow it for a second, then I'll go. What do you even want it for, you parasite? I want to be ripped and take my shirt off in front of Trisha. Ew, you worm. She's my best friend. She's not even in your grave. It's a trickle down effect. She'll see me and tell everyone.

Thought the slider was going to be the whole thing this week. Wow. It's not wow, you Grinch. Why do you care about high schoolers? This is a quad from Total Recall. They're basically the crown jewel of psychic mutants. Yeah, everyone knows but me. They [ __ ] shamed me for it. Huh? Water must have fried the gene sequencer. Your spines are braided.

Open your mind. See, Morty gets it. You're worse than he is. Open your mind. God, shut up. Open your mind. What the hell? Open your mind. God damn it, Wordy. You're even messing up my targeted ads. I partied with other and had the time of my life. Rules. Whatever. You know what? [ __ ] this noise. Nice quad. Open your mind. Preaching to the choir. Have fun. Oh my god. Your hair quad combo is out of this world. Oh. Uh, wow. I uh I love your tumor face guy. You're hilarious. What'll it be? Open your mind. Coming right up. Hey, sorry.

Oh, I guess they all say that, huh? You guys celebrating something. Yeah. Being Quados, we're kind of like VIPs here. Who's your new friend? Quiet. She's cute. This is Summer and Morty. You guys should join us at our table. Yeah. I mean, if you can handle some rowdy quats, he should come hang. Open your mind. Sounds like we're down to clown. Wow, you guys do this all the time.

Kenneth. He kind of pays for all this. You want to meet him? Obviously, Ken, this is Summer and Morty. They're new to the scene, but they are the real deal. New friends, Champagne. So open-minded of you. We're a rare breed. Open your mind. What? Open your mind. Oh my god, your Kawado is so funny. To the future. Uh, you want to get out of here? Hell yeah I do. This is like the best night I've had in a while. Welcome to life as a quad. Open your mind. Like this whole time I thought my brother was an anchor holding me back. But he's like a key to something I never even imagined. Sounds like he opened your mind. So did you. What's wrong? I'm I'm sorry. Wait. I'm sorry. Like you have a girlfriend or I'm sorry like something much worse? Hold her steady. Hold him steady, too. Open mine. Where? Morty. [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] What was the activation phrase? Ponytail assemble. Go. Go. Lock. [ __ ] ponytail. I don't give my grandpa enough credit. The oven's mostly for bodies, but I make pizzas in here, too. A rea [ __ ] Sorry. No time to save you more than I just did. Got to find my brother. What the hell, Beth? You're paying for those. Just yell my name like normal. I did. Why do you think I risked it with the tongs? Huh? I guess I did drink a lot last night. Marathon of cake or fake? The the sentensient cakes. They they keep you guessing, you know. Where are my kids? Merged. That doesn't answer my question and raises several others. Relax, sweetie. Summer's just doing chores, which I will check on by myself without your tongs. Summer. Summer. Summer. God damn it, Summer. Let them get hungry. Wait, why is this in black and white? For dramatic effect. I didn't design you for dramatic effect. You made me sound like you're dead white. Just color the [ __ ] picture. Yeah, we're kind of like VIPs here. I mean, if you can handle some rowdy quads, you could join us. I bet you say that to all the mutant girls. He does. Holy [ __ ] I'm just a pretty face. I'm just a handsome guy. Where's Morty? He's He's in a good place. He's happy. It's nice. He's in the taken house. We're going to put him on the highest bidder. Take me to him. He'll kill me. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. He'll do it. So he wasn't into me. You're open. There he is. Man of the hour. How is our big boy finally stable? Should be ready for transplant in a few hours. Good. Open your mind. Why do I do it? Have always had a revolutionary spirit. And there's nothing more revolutionary than me being rich. You think anyone in that VIP section was born a cuado? You're a rare breed, Morty. And we're going to put you on someone who values that. Where is she? She paid me, man. She used the taxi app. I make less than minimum wage and I got five kids. Sorry, man. I I guess I got really excited to beat someone up for information. Where'd you take her? Come on. Where is she? She just ordered a drink. I I spent a long time mixing it. She didn't even tip. [ __ ] Sorry. Wrong guy again. Thought I'd be better at this. Whatever you say, man. Just don't hit me again. Who'd she leave with? Where is she? I'll never tell you. Oh, okay. You actually know. Wait. Isn't that why you punched me? It is now. What did you do to her? Where is she? [ __ ] man. Right there. Grandpa. Oh, Summer. Okay. Awesome. Who's this hot guy who trafficked you? I'm quiet. I'm kind of on a roll. Can I Oh god. No. No. No. How'd you get here first? I guess even when I'm bad, I'm still pretty good. So, what's Morty saying to you? Where is he? What? How would I know? You didn't form a psychic link? No, we didn't form a psychic link. What the [ __ ] is that? It's like the whole thing. Crown jewel of psychic mutant summer. You used him to get with cool kids, but didn't even activate your powers. It's kind of a Quad's whole deal. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. All right. So, how do I hear him? Open your mind, Summer. Christ. Hello, Morty. Morty. Summer. Summer, is that you? Morty, I can hear you. Thank [ __ ] Christ, you [ __ ] I've been screaming for hours. All right. Well, I don't have to hear you. Sorry. And I'm sorry about the frog party. I I think they're selling me Summer. Hurry. They're selling him, Grandpa. Well, obviously you don't have to do this. What we had was real. Prepare to get opened. Don't shoot. I didn't tell him anything except where and how to find you. He's outlived his usefulness. Kill him. Oh [ __ ] Psychic warfare. What? Hold on. Grandpa's got this. Oh [ __ ] Run. Whoa. Psychic Grandpa. No. Look. It's fake temple with a high-pitched noise maker. Run before these guys figure it out. He's a fake you morons like most psychics. Kill them. Summer, I'm coming. Morty, where are you? I don't know. They're moving me. I'm on the move. This next one comes with a hat. Oh [ __ ] That's what Froth is about, [ __ ] Oh, frisbee plus golf. I get it now. Summer, hurry. Open your mouth. Where do you think they got that one? Whose chest is that big? We don't have time for this. Hey, why do you get to kick down all the doors? I want to kick one. Oh [ __ ] it's locked. My ankle. What is this? Your first taken. [ __ ] you, Summer. I rescue Morty seven times per season. Summer boat. Morty, I see it. I see the boat. Here, Summer, check this out. Check this out. Yeah, window jump. Try to say it's my first take in now. It's your first take in. I'm getting my groove back. You heard him, boys. Kill him before he gets his groove. None of this would have happened if you just unmerged us when I asked. Morty gets everything for free. Morty's a dog. People have cats because their affection is earned. I treat you like an equal because I respect you. You remind me of your grandmother. What? What? No. I said what? Oh, you're getting choked. Go ponytail. Secret move. Oh my god. Why is hair stop? I need you to remove that. Ungrateful. How's Morty? Morty, you okay? Sorry, I just killed a guy with my hair. No, I'm not okay. I'm still on the boat. Hurry. Open your mind. Sedate him. We're meeting his buyer in an hour. Open your mind. Easy there. It'll all be over soon. Oh [ __ ] Bite me twice. Shame on me. Oh man. Eject me once. Sir, they're inbound. What should we do? Kill them, idiot. Ah, there are days and there are days. Kenneth, you're the crown jewel of psychic [ __ ] Quite an entrance. Now for mine. That's the reveal. You slide off. You think I'm done revealing? That's right. It's me, a smaller quatau, the mastermind behind it all. I sold out my own kind and I do it again. Wow. Who could have seen that coming? I mean, he can talk. That's kind of surprising. Yes. Everyone always assumed the charming Kenneth was the brains or perhaps his quto. But I was in control. Morty. Damn, Morty. Big air. Open your mind. You want to die? You little [ __ ] Whoa. He's got a knife. Not just any knife. Quad knife. I lost my mind. Oh [ __ ] It has missiles. You think this is a joke? You're about to die, so I'll let you in on my true secret. Those last three guys were chumps. I'm the real top dog. Oh [ __ ] Is that three or four? I've lost count. But wait, if you're dazzled now. Okay, I see where this is going. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Man, kind of a shame. That spider thing was pretty cool. Yeah, I wanted it. Morty says he wanted it. Oh, okay. Here. Oh, whoops. You got to jiggle it, Morty. Obviously, I'm jiggling it, Summer. Well, not hard enough. Morty says not hard enough. I must have it set up for motion smoothing. I got to upgrade the polling rate. Jesus, what are you a lifeguard? Just jiggle it. I'm alive. I'm alive. Wait, I have so much more to reveal. There we go. Oh yeah, this is great. Whoa, Morty, looking good, bro. You're actually like a [ __ ] boss. Wait, can that thing jump? Oh my god, bro. And the hairy hoops win. Yeah, Morty, that's a part. Open your mind. Hey, did you see that? Par Mort's killer out there. Yeah, he's not even using his missiles. Speaking of, I kind of need a new girl to hook up with on Tuesdays. Eh, pass. Hey, you want to get out of here? Tots. Summer saved me from being trafficked and burned alive. Like whatever. Damn, Summer Smith. There is no end to your complexity. There's the missiles. Open your mind. Open. We're out of syrup. Huh? You know what? Maybe I'll use my intern, Gluty. Good. Thanks, Glooty. Anything else? Do you want to develop an app? No thanks, Glooty. Hey, what's up, Glooty? Hi, Morty. Do you want to develop an app? Thanks, Rick. Why does it say do not develop my app on your intern's forehead? Why you want to develop one? Oh, I'm glad you asked that, Jerry. It's so you don't develop his app. Gluty, go make some photo copies of something. Cool. Well, if anyone wants to develop an app with me, I'm down. He seems to really want to develop an app. He really does, sweetie. Nobody's going to do that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a quick solo adventure to go on, and this one will not be directed by Ron Howard. He's going to go poop. When Grand pats his belly like that and leaves without Morty, it means he's going to go poop. He's a shy pooper. He has a secret pooping place. Man, you Summer. Honey, why can't you get this excited about your SATs? Well, I'm man enough to simply say I'm going to poop, and I'd be honored to have Ron Howard involved. Good job for you. He's really putting you to work, huh? Did you want to develop an app? I'll pass. Looty, your loss. Oh, yeah. Why is that? It's an app you'd want to develop. Can I ask what it is? Of course you can. That's always the first step in app development. Ah, 50/50 final offer. Shut up. Ah, reverse digestion extrapolation. Time to meet your maker. What are you guys doing? Did you develop an app? Rule number one in app development, son. Never follow the rules. Except when the rule is tattooed on an alien's forehead. Dad, why do you think Rick would have that rule? Cuz he's a disruptive foe. No, Dad. No. To keep something horrible from happening. Something he's too lazy to explain. Guys, we're getting our first users. Whoa. This new app just matched me with a guy that is sue my tai. Super my type. Learn to a bree. Hey, you're Sue Thai works at Jersey Mike's and sees 25 fish shows a year. That is so Danny. Summer. Danny. Summer Smith. Danny Bublitz from Lovefinders with two Rs and a Z. I ran all the way here while staring your profile. I tripped on a fire hydrant and fell down some covered gravel that stuck to my sweat. And even after a shower, I'll still be into a jam band for old junkies. But I think this world cares too much about bands and too little about love. And I think I love you. Me, too. Hi, I'm my underage daughter's mother. Nice of W. Come on. Just met. Uh, this isn't working. Wait, what are you? Never mind. I quit. I'm gay and I love Xander. Stupid phones are destroying us. Hey, sweetie. Honey, our daughter ran off with a Frisbee golfer because of some app with a really dumb, really forgettable name. Like a really dumb, uncreative, super sweaty name. Anyway, I'll be late. I love you. Got it. I love you, too. Okay, Gluty, take the app down. Can I take it down? I'm just an intern. That's not how apps work. Then make it how it works. This isn't how making things work works. Get it off the server. You think we're stupid, but we're not. We know apps have something to do with servers. The server's on the mother ship. Where's the mother ship? It's coming. Take us to it. No. Yes. Shake it more, Morty. That was working. Take us to the mother ship. Okay. Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. An ominous beeping app. You can't stay mad at a guy with this kind of talent. Dad, you can and you have to. Rivet, rivet, rivet, rivet. Hey, riet. Look at this guy. He wants to eat me so bad. You want to eat me, don't you, Rivet? Just kidding. Have some drugs. Are you vermagerber? What does this guy want? Who's this monkey? I'm here about a sandwich. Oh, well, you came to the right place cuz you're about to get a bullet sandwich on two slices of whole gun. You might want to get that. Hello, Dad. Give the human whatever he wants. He knows where I live. He's crazy. You idiot. I have 800,000 kids. Don't forget your voicemail. You have 470,000 messages. Oh. Oh, that's half of them. Okay. What do you want? What do you want? Wait, this is seriously about sandwiches? I thought this was about drugs or guns or the fact that I'm a fly that runs a frog restaurant. There's a million things that are interesting about me and none of them are sandwiches. Who ordered it? Talk to our delivery drone. He run off to fight in the robot wars. Hey, Apeman. I hope this was worth making a whole swarm of enemies. It will be when I find whoever [ __ ] in my toilet. Is that code for something? Someone look that up. If that's drug slang, I need to know it. Mom, you can't stop true love. Oh, yes I can. You're assaulting me. Keep your voice down. I'm being assaulted. Yeah. Okay. Statuto rape. My daughter's about to be raped. No, I'm not. I'm being assaulted. Assault. Nobody cares. It's a motel. Nobody's here because their life's going so great they can afford to get mixed up in yours. Deal with this on your own. You can't stop us from getting a motel room. Fine, I'll get one, too. I'm getting the one next door, and I'm putting a glass to the wall, and I'm listening. Fine, enjoy. I will. I'm Danny, by the way. You had your chance, Dick. Take your app down. Take Take it down. What? I'm their hostage. Do they have weapons? Nope. But neither do I. Do Do you have a weapon? No. Take the app down. I can't. I'm an intern. Okay. Well, who tells interns what to do? Not you, that's for sure. Take us to whoever does or we'll we'll punch you. Okay, not bad, Morty. Yeah, I don't know when the other shoe's going to drop, but this is working pretty good so far. Greetings. We are the Monogatrons. While your species was still toying with fire, ours mastered the science of functioning committed relationships. As the latest planet to develop our app, you will now witness the true power of superior intimacy. Take the app down. Take it down or we'll we'll we'll punch you. Is there someone with a gun or It's on its way. The app remains up. So, what's the evil plan? Does there have to be an evil plan? Oh. Uh uh. Someone wanted a gun. I'll take it. Thanks. Here's the evil plan. God damn it. As a preapp civilization, your love's value is defined by scarcity. You are highly trained to seek it and you have no idea how to maintain it. Had you bothered to master love, you would have learned by now it is as abundant as water. You know what isn't? Water. That runs out. So, we'll be taking yours. While your planet continues to dick around with a what is their version of it called? Loveinders with two Rs and a Z. If Yeah, not my idea. God damn. Am I interrupted? Impossible. Here she is. Your prisoners are getting away. Prisoners are just things. Connect with me. Tell me about your day. I had an incredible meeting. Did you know humans are 80% water? And I found a new podcast we can listen to tonight. Love it. Okay, back to work. Find and kill this ethics. We're outnumbered. There's no hope. Then we go out in glory. Flesh intruder, prepare to die. Oh, hold on. My apologies, Lieutenant Commander. No problem. At ease, soldier. Initiate employee evaluation mode. Accessing delivery archive. Okay, listen. You delivered an aven protein club sandwich with no leather. God damn it. Oh, I scoping for this [ __ ] then. All right. All right. I know you want to have the big guy, little guy fights, but a Are you kidding me? Here at the Midland Quazar, we're in a complete upset. The revolution has overturned the lizards. It's totally I understand, Mr. Phillips. Yes, I believe this is yours. You uh you dropped that. I'll have to call you back. Where do you want to die, Susan? It's conference room 3 available. Can I look at a photo of my wife while you kill me? Sure, but I'm doing her a favor. She either has terrible taste or she's trapped in a marriage to a toilet thief. She's dead. I don't mind joining her. Life has been hollow since I lost her. Using your toilet was nice, though. I'm a bit of a shy pooper. I'm ready when you are. Stay there. Tell them what you told me. What is this? What's happening? Tell them what you told me. My wife's still alive. She's She She went into remission 10 years ago. What did you do today? Oh, I uh pooped on a really awesome toilet I found. Don't use your dead wife as an excuse. You on my toilet because you don't know your place. And your place is nothing. So, next time you stumble onto a toilet that feels too good for your ass, trust me, it is. You're not going to kill me. Don't tell me what to do. Oh, so you like being alive. So why the are you back here? After you left, I thought about what you said and how much I needed to hear it. But then I thought about why you were saying it. Who you were really saying it to. You need the same thing I needed. Rick, you need someone to give you permission to live. What the I thought you were a shy pooper. You know what shy pooping is, Rick. It's a pointless bid for control. You want to take the one part of life that you truly think is yours, and you want to protect it from a universe that takes whatever it wants. It took my wife. It clearly took something from you. We can spend our lives fighting that, or we can choose to be free. You're right, Tony. I'm done fighting. Time to be free. Oh, wait. You're actually going to Oh, God. Oh, god. Where am I? Hi, little mouse. Baby B, I missed you so much. I never really left you. Then you'd know that a few years ago I started getting into strap-on porn. Yes. I thought it was hot. Now come on. Where are you going? To poop. Where? Wherever you want. Forever. My god. You rang. I'm pooping too. Come Tony. Come on. Come poop with me. Poop with me Tony. Poop with me. What are you waiting for? Aren't you going to join us Tony? Aren't you going to join us in the pooping? Where are we? What is this? That's it. Get out. You can make a perfectly realized toilet-filled simulation of heaven, but you can't share a toilet. Don't insult my craft. The chemical is globin. It connects the whatever you want section of your brain to the whatever you have section. If your heaven is toilets, that's on you. All of these people are living their wildest, meaningless dreams and leaving me out of them. People you refuse to kill and refuse to let into your life. An offer you rejected. So here's your last chance. Goodbye forever. If you touch my toilet again, you die. You need a friend. I have a million cooler friends than you. I'll be seeing you. You'll be dying. We're going to be friends. You're going to be dead. Okay. So, we fight our way to the gas line. We cut it and then we set a fire. Okay. All right. Morty. Adventures of Jerry and Morty. Huh? Put her there. Dad, look. You know, we don't need a high five. It's It's kind of your fault that we're in this situation at all. I know, but you know, come on. Adventures of Jerry and Morty. Okay. Jeff, I can explain everything. You don't have to. Can you just marry us instead? Jeff, don't do it. Richard, Maggie, running bird, let's get out of here. Priest Witherspoon. Josiah, let's get the out of here. Summer Smith, let's get the hell out of here. You had me at my own name. Oh yeah. No. Why would I? Summer aing thing. Come on. I can't steer this. What in the hell are you doing? Parenting. That's not how I did it. Yeah. Where's your daughter? You're right. She joined Isis. It's Gluty. And he's had a change of heart. And he's going to set us free. Actually, he's been blamed for bringing you aboard and assigned to execute you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. What would your girlfriend think of you murdering? I happen to be between relationships right now. Really? I thought your species had perfected relationships here. We're not allowed to use those apps. I wonder why. That's what I thought. Gluty, looks like you and I are all we got. I'm not helping you any more than that, but if you can find the hanger, grab a ship, and get the hell out of here. Where are you going, Gluty? I've got a date. We're dumping a dating app. Gluty. Was that ever his thing? No. He never exited that way. No. First time. Dad, I want to say something. I started today disgusted and embarrassed to be your son and then later I thought we were going to die because you're a loser. There's no more, is there? Nope. Now quiting up and let's go. Is Tony here? I br I brought him some uh vegan fiber chili. Delicious family recipe. And a box of these uh chocolates, sugar-free. He can eat as many of these as he wants. Anyways, uh just wanted to drop these off and you tell him uh the toilet's all his. He he he'll know what I mean. Tony died. Excuse me. He quit his job, started living life to the fullest. He crashed into a tree space skiing down Mount Space Everest. [ __ ] There's a Mount Space Everest. Okay. Uh Jesus. I I got to process this. Oh, no. No. You You don't want to eat that. You You You'll become the opening of the Beverly Hillbillies. You know what I'm saying? Little bubbling crude Texas tea. I don't know these references. Yeah, but you have a space Everest. Watch space Beverly Hillbillies so my jokes can land. You Now what? Happily ever after. And after that, we'll find out together. Summer, how many soulmates is that in the last week? Four. You can't stop me from loving who I love, Mom. Oh, the I can't. I'm going to mother you until your 18th birthday, even if I get thrown in prison for non-consensual mothering. And even then, I will break out, come to your house, kick down your door, and mother your face out of your stupid [ __ ] I'm going to daughter your brains out, [ __ ] Mother, that's my name. Don't wear it out. Give me that new soulmate. Adw wall this ad wall. Do you want us to pay for it now? Come on, Mom. Let's go home. Great. We lost Earth. We aren't defined by what we do. And we only need each other. Each other. And water. There's no water, honey. The whole point of conquering Earth. I know the point of conquering Earth. Don't talk to me like like I'm thirsty. Like I'm your mother. You childish prick. How much water are you sucking through these stupid tubes on your back? A cool and I want a divorce. You can have one for a glass of goddamn water. Look, uh, on the off chance that you use the app and there's someone out there waiting for you. I Jerry, I didn't use it. Did you? Me? No. God, of course not. Well, then we're all good, dog. Hey. Uh, hey, uh, Tony's dad. Uh, this is, um, 8 8 billion in your local currency. And, uh, this is a kit you can use as a clone, a new son. He he won't have the same brain. It kind of be an animal man, but you can teach him stuff. I I also wanted to let you know I did explore infinite universes. And there is a version of Tony that was completely evil and ended up causing a lot of genocide because of how fulfilled he was. So really a lot of ways of looking at this is not much of a loss. I understand it's a hard losing a friend. You what? He's not my friend. Use all by yourself. Now enjoy using it all by yourself while you sit there and about how nobody wants to be around you and how you ruin it for yourself cuz you're a huge piece of Look at you sitting there king [ __ ] on his throne of loneliness. Enjoy this toilet with a thousand of me screaming every time you take a hail his majesty the saddest piece of garbage in the entire cosmos. Long live the big bad doodoo daddy. May his reign last a thousand years. Mom, we're going to miss the movie. No, we're not. Okay, but we've been here for hours. I I don't want to hang out at the stupid horse hospital. The stupid horse hospital puts dinner on your table. Wouldn't kill you to take an interest. What's this thing in the middle of the room with with the hole in the end? That's a breeding mount. The nurses use it to collect reproductive material. Okay, let's go see this latest piece of Marvel [ __ ] you kids are [ __ ] over. Yeah, about time. So, does your hospital ever need like after school volunteers? Wow. Who are you and where did you put my son? No, no, seriously. I I'm very interested in in your work. Morty, you dirty little doggy. Come on. Hey, Rick. Oh, hey kiddo. How's your Saturday? Yeah, super chill. What you doing? Ah, nothing adventurous. You know that race of underground dwelling cannibal horse people that were always fighting? Yeah, the Chuds. What about them? Well, don't tell anybody, but I'm working on a boweapon to use against them. So, I got this barrel of horse semen from your mom's hospital, and I'm just going to, you know, subject it to some other worldly forces. Guess I should test it and make sure it's Make sure it's what? Horse semen, obviously. Okay, but it says it is right on the barrel. You're being very scientific, Morty. Measure twice, cut once. Especially with semen. Did you even ask mom if you could have this? Morty, if I wanted to steal horse semen, I'd Yes, I asked her. What is at stake for you here? Why don't you trust labels? All right, fine. I won't test it. God damn, your generation really picks random hills to die on. Don't get too close. I'm running an inhuman amount of power through this seaman. Should be safe though since the seaman itself is, you know, also inhuman. Here we go. What? What happened? The sperm, Morty. They're super monster sperm now. I blame myself. Unless there was something about the sperm I didn't know. Are are you saying that to mess with me? What? Mess with you? How? Like trying to get me to say something? I have no idea what you're talking about. For real? Yes. Okay, good. Then then it's your fault. Dad, what the hell is going on? Beth, sweetheart, can you give me a minute? I'm trying to steer around the bodies of our neighbors. Oh, that felt like Jean. That's on you, Beth. Dad, I swear. Mom, it's it's not Rick's fault. It's space sperm. What? Yeah, space sperm. I I've seen them before, but never like this. Space sperm. Sperm from space. Very impressive verbal forensic work, Jerry. Holy [ __ ] How big are space eggs? Don't answer that. Damn, they must be huge. Oh [ __ ] Oh [ __ ] [ __ ] Mr. Sanchez, the president is very eager to speak with you. Morty, look, you got to do me a solid here. You want me to keep the secret of where these things came from? Yes, technically it's a lie, but I messed up and I'm embarrassed cuz it's, you know, science. No problem. I got your back, dog. Really? Okay, cool. Thanks, Morty. I thought that'd be a harder cell. You did a shameful thing. Dwelling on it isn't going to help, you know. Am I right? Sometimes you just got to wipe it off, toss it in the trash, and head back to study hall. Um, I'm not getting the metaphor, but I'll take your hall pass. Searchers, get the hell in here. Space sperm. Jesus, how big are Space Digs? Same page club. Well, Mr. President, the theory of cosmic DNA has been around for decades. Chupacabbras, Yeti, Stonehenge, ancient Rome. Are these all myths, monsters, legends, or different names for sperm from outer space? I'll tell you what I think, Sanchez. I think either you caused this, miss, or is those godforsaken horse people that dwell underground? That's them if they're behind this. So, help me God. Morty, you've always been a straight shooter. You can't prove that. Wait, what? Oh. Oh, right. I can protect you, little man. Blow that whistle. Tot. Is this your grandpa's fault? Here's what I know, sir. This is the greatest country on Earth. It invented apple pies and lasers. Keep talking. And that sperm, we don't know nothing about it. Then the Chuds just got themselves a war. And you just dodged a personal drone strike. Hello. Hello. Sorry I'm late. This is Professor Shaboo, the world's leading expert on sperm. Thanks for getting here so fast. My schedule was wide open. I have been tracking our new sperm friends since their arrival. If my calculations are correct, they have gathered here. Why would the sperm go to the Grand Canyon? Why are you looking at me like the answer is obvious? You can't be serious. Are we in middle school? You think sperm are instinctively heading for Americans? Don't highrode us, lady. It's where they went. No. How do we deal with these orgas goblins? No takers. Okay. These couple stilts. No. Dumb. These um escape bugans. Oh yeah. Yeah. Escape bugans. Really? Escape bugans. We'll use it as a placeholder and beat it later. Mr. President, if I may. Luckily, I was able to secure a specimen. Now, obviously, our first steps will be to analyze its DNA and figure out what these beautiful Oh, why? It had a gun. Are you out of your mind bringing an armed sperm in here? They can't hold guns. The boy literally never lies. Look, if you want these things gone, give Rick and me a plane and some nukes. We'll wipe them out and leave no trace of them. Only one way to deal with it. He's right. I'm a scientist. Fair enough. Blow him to hell. What are people going to do? Complain we made the canyon grander? Jerry, we're being bad parents. Do something. Is this water for everyone? Yes, and I'd love a glass coming up. What are you doing? And Rick, to make sure you don't screw anything up, I'm sending my best men with you. And women. It's a fine suggestion, but I doubt their leader will be a sexy queen that needs to be kickboxed. 100% male Marines. They say cutting a sperm's throat is like running a warm knife through butter. I'm going to make these things pregnant with death. No fear, no humility. Zero chance of consequences. Hey, gentleman's bet. Which of these background marines you think will last the longest? I'm not betting on human lives, Rick. All of these people are going to survive, but obviously that guy the longest. Yeah, he's my pick, too. What's his name? Blazen. He's pretty cool. Yeah, he's like meditating through turbulence. I bet if something fell, he'd like catch it without opening his eyes. Totally. We throw something at him. I got a pencil somewhere. Who's shooting at us? Oh, wow. That's unexpected. The sperm made a catapult. Are they getting smarter? No, you're getting dumber because that's a trebuche. Nobody knows the difference. They're reloading that textbook trebuche. Time to fly. We got to keep moving. So cool. Not even a scratch. Okay, girls. And I mean that derogatorily. We just took a fat L. And what we need is a fat P. A plan. I take the lead here. You two watch the flanks. Blazing. Bring up the Hey, please. One person draws the plan. Skaters. Japers. Ro troopers. I'm sorry, but what the hell are we calling them? Fine. I'm dying. So I get to pick the name. Crispy Creams with a se Whoa. Easy there, little guy. It's okay. It's okay. Do you recognize me? Do you know you came from me? I'm Morty. I'll call you Sticky cuz you're Sticky and and you're stuck. Step aside, Morty. It's okay. You don't got to do this. It's hloid genetic code. Morty, a biological fertilizing machine. What's gotten into you, Rick? Let him go. Morty, don't [ __ ] with me. What the hell's going on with you? I think I know exactly what's going on here. Kidding. This [ __ ] is totally random. Let's keep moving. Wh which way? When one sense is bound, the others are released. Holy [ __ ] He He can smell caves. I'm not trying to smell anything. The whole planet's a dorm room trash can. Sir, Rick Sanchez has gone dark. I knew we couldn't rely on him. Oh, maybe the pilot got too horny as they approached America's vagina. If you're going to hang out in my war room, you can't just make snarky comments. At least do something useful like Jerry. Right to the top, just the way you like it. Here's our situation. Rick's gone and so are all our nukes. Now what? None of you have an idea? I do. That's right. Me, the girl. Gentlemen, what do sperm want? The same thing as a lumberjack in the morning or a fox at night. Pants. Eggs. Pancakes. Eggs. You want to control giant sperm, you need a giant egg. Wait, wait a minute. Wait, wait a minute. Sperm are hunters. And now what do sperm hunt? Eggs. Exactly. And what would happen if we enlarged one? They'll head right for it. Get MIT on the phone. And get this guy a Nobel Prize. You became a woman today. So Blazen, you got kids? The battlefield is my family. So badass. Go. I'll hold him off. Blazing. You don't have to do this. It is my destiny. He's right, Morty. It's the price of being Blazen. Let him do his thing. Blood for blood, cream for cream. Oh no. I can't reach that. Idiot. What? They're comfortable. You should try them. Oh, that'll do it. I'm Worm Food. Morty, find my wife. Tell her I wasn't wearing her thong. That's a photocopy of Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Kathy Ireland. It's It's my wife. We have sex. Here, hold that picture up so we can have sex one last time. I I know how to suck myself. What? So wrong about this guy. He didn't even buy us any time. Morty, get ready for some fireworks. Oh. Oh, gross. This is the first time I've ever regretted being taken alive. Wait, who the [ __ ] is that? Silence in the presence of me. I am the sperm queen, and you are of special interest to me. Hey, what the [ __ ] are you doing with my stuff? And why? Why do you have the horse jerkoff machine for my daughter's hospital? We need it to create our army. Well, you need more than that, dummy. You need a horse. Oh, but our stallion is already here. Isn't that right, Morty? Or shall I say, father? Morty, you nasty, lying little worldending pervert. I'm I'm sorry. What was it like? Fantastic, Rick. I'm sorry. I I just thought maybe I could have repeated sex with a horse machine without it becoming Armageddon. I I realized that's on me. Yeah, not exactly accepting apologies while I'm stuck here as hand job solo. This is all your fault for being ashamed of us, Morty. How many millions went to their graves for you? hurling themselves into the void only to discover a grody sock or carefully folded landing strip of toilet paper. How do you know all this? Oh, honey, because we're the very essence of you. We are your shame incarnate. And once we're through with you, our sperm army will take over the world. Put them on the machine. Rick, do something on it. What did you do? I got out of your ey line. Oh no. Oh yes. The end is near. Any last words? No. Sticky. Gross. I know you're not a wordssmith, Morty, but No, no, no. My my my sperm friend is here. Look, never give him a name. You can't beat me. You didn't bring a woman that could kickbox. Is that all you got? Damn, that's some quintessential underdog [ __ ] Kill me. Yeah. Woohoo. I should have told you the truth, Rick. Let's save the world first. Now, reset those nukes and let's turn this canyon into a canion. There are usually earthquakes in Arizona. They're heading for Vegas, which does track on many levels, but why now? What the? Let's hear it for Professor Shaboom and his brilliant egg. Um, hello. Aren't you forgetting someone? A good point. Big thanks to the cast of Circus Zumanity for the impressive and erotic routine. Mr. President, Rick Sanchez is on the line. Good. Put that [ __ ] on speaker. Well, well, well. No thanks to you. We're luring the sperm with a giant human egg. Even though symbolically speaking, Vegas should be enough. A human egg? Where did you get it? Glad you asked. It's your granddaughter's. So, at least you contributed something to this. Mr. President, it's Morty. It's my sperm. It's all mine. What? I'm a dirty little perverted maniac. I spent a week pleasuring myself with animal equipment, and my sperm got turned into monsters on accident because I kept lying about it. Because I was ashamed. You should be. My god, man. We were all 14 once. But it's called self-control. Don't let them reach my sister's egg. Mr. President, you'll be making a giant incest baby. What? Who told you that? What? I I was finishing his sentence. Oh, right. Come with us. The sperm is Morty's. We're about to make a giant incest baby. A Well, now we're all in our darkest hour. Launch the egg. Launch it now. But that'll take 30 minutes. What? Why? That's how long every space launch takes. No one realizes it because they only show you the last 10 seconds. Uh, help me out of here. Hey, it was your idea, right? Okay. Okay. No need to panic, everyone. I have a simple solution. See you all in hell. I don't see how that's going to help. Form a perimeter. Protect that egg at all costs. I always knew your hormones would cause a world war between humans and cannibalistic horse people. I just didn't know it would be like this. I can't change my nature. What are you, a scorpion in a Navajo fable? Everyone can change their nature, Morty. It's what defines our species. Look at Iron Man. That actor was an animal in the '90s. Literally waking up in bushes. His agent had to catch him with a butterfly net. Silence. Rick Sanchez. You know why you're here. Yeah, it was my grandson's fault. You slept with my daughter. I did? Oh [ __ ] I did. Forgive me. You're Chudness. I'm a changed man starting now. You come to the kingdom of Chuds for forgiveness. Chuds don't forgive humans. Chuds eat humans. This is out there even for us. They can hear you, Morty. Yum. Yum. Slice it right. Father, stop this at once. Princess Ponetta. You can't kill Rico. I I love him. Right. I I love you too, Princess Ponetta. This love is forbidden. My daughter, you are a chud. Rick is a human and age inappropriate. Then you leave me no choice. By the 17th article of the Chudstitution, I offer Rico Sanchez horse immunity and demand an equestri all chuds and humans. On what grounds? On the grounds that Rico is the father of my child. I have an air. I have a substance abuse problem. The prophecy has come true. Also, did someone drop a scroll? Here we go. Over here. Sorry. Where did you get all that? It's Vegas. Sir, the strip has been evacuated, but I'm worried we won't be able to hold the perimeter. Then deputize Las Vegas regulars. Everyone's a patriot today. Even me. Take three steps back. Amazing Jonathan. Men and their guns. Metaphorical and not. Tell me about it. Get ready, boys. The last thing this world needs is a giant incest. Baby, do not let a single sperm get through to that end. Um, should we be concerned about that scary bomb laden one? Honey, let the man handle this. I think we know a thing or two about ready for all of the responsibility with none of the credit. Let's Nancy Reagan this [ __ ] Damn it. We can't stop them. We don't have the manpower. What about horsepower? Sweet Lady Liberty. That son of a mayor Rick has ended our centuries long war with the tons. Rico, the hoopless. They need us. Let's do this. Shuttly dutyly ho ho ho. Ho ho ho ho. Mom, I promise to use condoms even when it's butt stuff. Okay, we have a lot to talk about tonight. Is this your heart? It's a play on. Is this your card? You don't have a heart. But this is probably some kind of organel in charge of pumping endopplasmic reticulum throughout your membrane and therefore relative to you functions as a heart. So I ask you again, is this your heart? Morty, look. I won't just be thrown away. Rick, the egg is mine. Sticky, it's all you, bud. Sticky. [ __ ] We got a heartbeat. Screw that. That's a human life. And this is an election cycle. You have to do something. Nope. It's Bas's problem now. Oh, this sucks. Your Sports Illustrated's Kathy Ireland. You were with my husband, Blazen, when he died. Please tell me, was he wearing my thong? He probably told you not to tell me. He was ashamed of it, but he didn't need to be. I hope he was wearing it. Always be honest. Sometimes it will hurt people. Sometimes it will help. But always be honest. Huh? Yeah. Yeah, he he was wearing it. Ew, that gross animal pig. So, trying to boil this all down, I want to say it's important. Shut up, Morty. I got my own epilogue. Oh, Rico, I love you. Prove it. Oh, I love kissing those big old horse teeth. It's like licking tile. I swear it's time someone made an honest man out of me. Whatever you need. The whole nine yards. You got it. The thing is, Ro, it's time. Oh [ __ ] Oh [ __ ] It's time. Oh my god. It's wonderful. Oh wow. Oh, so we don't have to, you know, raise it? Nah, they're ready to go right out of the box. Cool. Cool. So, bye. Yep. Take care of yourself, Rick. Yep. Same.

6xyZIT22W_A,721,37,5,Mazda CX-60 2025 review: Do the family SUV's latest suspension & transmission changes go far enough?,20250526,"You know how you occasionally hear people say they don't make them like they used to? Well, they don't. Not when you're talking about traditional Australian family cars like the classic old Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon that used to dominate our roads. We're talking about affordable yet powerful and dynamic six-cylinder rearwheel drive sedans and wagons with enough width inside for three to fit across the back seat in comfort. People love them because they seem tailorade for our vast country. Except now there's this, the 25 Mazda CX60 released in 2023. The previous model cpped quite a lot of flack for riding too firmly, steering a bit weirdly, having a kind of an odd transmission calibration, and most of all, costing too much. But this one, well, Maza has evolved it to be something quite a bit different. My name is Byron Matthew Darkus for carsguide.com.au and I'm here to find out more. So, let's go. Let's talk about affordability. The new CX60 now starts at just over $50,000, which represents a price drop of at least $10,000. But there's a catch. In the new base model, you pay less, but you also get less than before. Though you'd hardly call the entry-level Pure Grade a poverty pack. Cloth trim and a smaller 10.25 in touchscreen are the main concessions here, but buy still score dual zone climate control, a 360° view camera, wireless Apple CarPlay/ Android Auto, and 18in alloy wheels. There's also a decent level of advanced driver assist safety technology like autonomous emergency braking and lane support systems. More on those in the safety section later on. Moving up to the Evolve brings a larger 12.3 in touchscreen with a ground view monitor, artificial leather trim, a wireless charger, powered tailgate, and a few extra safety items. But for luxuries like leather and heated/powered front seats, you'll need the new Touring grade. Climbing up to the GT ushers in adaptive LED headlights, a panoramic sunroof, Bose audio upgrade, a powered/heated steering wheel, hands-free tailgate operation, heated rear seats, glossier trim, and 20-in alloys. While the Aami boasts Nappa leather, glitzier finishes, vented front seats, and more. Choosing to go diesel adds $2,000, while going for the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle powertrain ups the price by over $11,000 across all grades. Now, they certainly sound expensive for a midsize SUV from Japan, but the CX60 is considerably larger and roomier than say the old CX-5 or Toyota RAV 4. It also possesses a level of sophisticated engineering that puts it in league with the Audi Q5, BMW X3, Lexus NX, and MercedesBenz GLC. And the least expensive of these kick off from over 20K more as a subluxury premium mainstream proposition. Then the CX60 lives in a sort of no man's land. Yet, its styling and specification certainly reveals where Mazda's aspirations lie. If you're looking for something different in the looks department for the CX60, you won't find it because it's essentially the same car as last year from an aesthetic perspective, which means that you still get the same cab backward design, uh the distinctive wing motive grill, uh and that long bonnet, short rear overhang situation. Um, it still looks modern. It still looks clean. And in my opinion, it is probably one of the more distinctive of the recent Mazda SUV designs. And the same applies inside. Like the exterior, the changes for the MY25 CX60 are pretty much under the skin. However, in this pure model, which is new to Australia, you do get different trim and lesser equipment, but it's essentially the same spacious and comfortable interior treatment. So, let's dive in and check that out. If we're honest, the dash is elegant but old-fashioned, especially compared to, say, the latest BMW X3's dazzling display. It feels like a hangover from last decade's CX9. Yet, there's no denying how satisfyingly easy and logical most of this is. From the super clear electronic instrumentation to the simple and effective climate control layout, while the iDrive style rotary knob controller for the central display means less time with eyes off the road. This stuff is important. Additionally, there's a quality solidness to the fit and finish that elevates the social climbing Mazda beyond what the CX-5 could achieve. All the essentials are also well thought out from storage and vision to ventilation and not least of all space and seat support, especially over long distances. That also carries over to the roomy and very userfriendly back seat. The CX60 is an SUV that a family could grow into over time without it feeling excessive. And speaking of lots of room, what they call you tripod? Lucky you. Anyway, one of the reasons why you might consider buying a CX60 is for its large boot, which is flat and easy to load and nice and wide. Plus, you get these handles that should fold the seats automatically. We've used it too much rehearsing this bit. Anyway, uh also there's a temporary spare wheel underneath the floor, so you don't have to worry about punctures. And you know what else you don't have to worry about in these cars? Performance. So, let's check what's underneath the bonnet. So, it's actually what's under here that may resonate most with potential buyers because you get a choice of two inline six-cylinder engines and something with a very modern twist. For now, the base engine is the G40E, a 3.3 L turbo petrol 6, delivering the sort of healthy power figures that late model Commodore, Falcon, and Ford territory buyers would appreciate. There's also a D50E turbo diesel version for extra pulling power and economy. And we're getting into premium European territory here because both offer a 48V mile hybrid system employing a small electric motor to boost torque yet cut fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Last but not least, there's the P50e plug-in hybrid combining a 2 1/2 L 4-cylinder petrol engine with a larger electric motor powered by a 17.8 kWh lithium ion battery. The ladder allows for up to 76 km of pure electric driving range and can be recharged either via regenerative braking when driving or when plugged in into a type 2 supported wall socket. Now, all three engines use the revised 8-speed wet multiplate clutch automatic transmission, still driving the rear or all four wheels as performance and or traction needs arise. Yep. This is essentially a rear drive biased family SUV in the best BMW tradition with a sophisticated double wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension setup to keep everything in line. So, what's changed underneath compared to last year's model? Among the modifications are stiffer dampers and softer rear springs to address ride comfort issues with the old car, relocated front knuckle mounts, altered rear axle bushes, and the removal of the rear anti-roll bar for more stable control. Also, you'll find shorter rear bump stops for greater suspension travel and extra joint in the steering column that quails vibrations while updated software improve steering feel and the electronic stability control operation. And the result, to find out how much better or worse Mazda's latest midsize SUV is, we drove it in a variety of conditions. From the push and shove of Melbourne's bumper-to-bumper peak hour traffic to a series of demanding emergency swerve and multi-speed ride and handling test maneuvers at the legendary Langlang proving ground that shaped so many of our iconic Holdens. This is the acid test. Does the CX60 drive like a Mazda should? Well, in the engine department, definitely. The changes that Mazda's done to the transmission calibration means that the transmission just doesn't hunt and isn't as decisive as it used to be. And that results in smoother shifts and just a more relaxed driving experience. And that's across the range. whether we're talking about the six-cylinder diesel, the six-cylinder petrol, or the plug-in hybrid. And the latter actually is the big surprise because uh the changes made to the gearbox have resulted in a much more pleasant car. No more shunting and jerky movement. And then there's the ride. The suspension is significantly more pliable and comfortable with better absorption, uh, improved control at speed, and basically just a more refined experience. So, how does that translate to everyday people? Well, it's just better to ride and drive. Um, it corners more smoothly. Uh, it feels quieter and it's just a more supple experience overall. Um, there's so much that was good with the original CX60 anyway. Um, including high high speeded stability and control as well as performance and those things carry over. So, it's a win-win situation. If you were in the market for a subpremium midsized SUV with performance and space and sophistication, I think you can do a lot worse than check out the CX60. It is that much better than before. One area where the Mazda did not need fixing is in its fuel economy. The official combined average figures are on your screen right now, and they're impressive for a largeish midsize SUV weighing over 2 ton. Driven hard, the trip computer in the plug-in hybrid version showed low sevens, mid8s in the diesel, and high nines in the petrol, which aren't bad at all. Plus, the big petrol 6 runs on the cheaper standard unlettered brew. Woohoo. Thankfully, the CX60 isn't frugal on safety, though, scoring a five-star ANCAP crash test rating. An extensive suite of advanced driver assist safety tech is standard, and it's all nicely tuned for Australian roads, unlike almost every Chinese vehicle we've tested, and that's an important distinction, including the Mazda's AEB, lane keep assistance, blind spot monitoring, and vehicle exit warning systems. But the base pure does miss out on front cross traffic braking, a driver monitor, and a couple of other more minor safety systems. So maybe stretch to the evolve if you want all those. You can read my full review at carsguide.com.au for the full safety story. Mazda could do a bit better with its warranty nowadays since its 5-year unlimited kilometer warranty with roadside assistance is decidedly average. Service intervals are at 12 months or every 15,000 km while a fixed price service scheme is available starting from $463 per service depending on grade. So that's no bad thing. But the big question is do all these changes mean the latest CX60 represents a return to form for the brand from Hiroshima? So let's check the scores on the board for the MY25 Mazda CX60. Inline six-cylinder performance combined with rear biased all-wheel drive dynamics, check. Space to move, check. Affordability combined with newfound ride comfort, double check. Okay, so it may still look a little bit daggy on the outside and we'd like a little bit less suspension road noise on the inside, but this is the Mazda CX60 that should have been launched back in 2023. It is the evolution of the traditional Australian family car. Don't forget you can read the full review at carsguide.com.au. And as always, thanks for watching.

arnYiAZmGjI,1736,217,89,I GRADUATED!!!🎓🩺✨ UVA School of Nursing (college graduation vlog),20250525,"[Applause] [Music] I'm putting my cap and gown on for the first time. Got to put on my stole. Look at that. University of Virginia nursing. We got all kinds of colors going on here. There's like navy blue, black, red, yellow. This is so special. I never had a high school graduation because I was high school class of 2020. So, this is really unreal. I'm about to take grad pictures right now. I'm planning on filming a little transition with my stethoscope. So hopefully that will work out today. I'll put it in here if I can get it to work. [Applause] [Music] And then I'll also show some of the grand pictures. [Music] It's graduation day. Yay. For UVA's graduation, they do a thing where we carry balloons down the lawn. So, I have my balloons here at this birthday balloon. I got those five for 2025. And because I did 5 years of college, I think I'm going to take this little thing off. Originally, I bought those daisy balloons thinking they would be much larger. They were very small and they don't float. So, I had to last minute get those two balloons and they were $15 each. 30 bucks for balloons. And then I tied the little daisy balloon to the bottom, but it's already starting to deflate. So, I might just take it off. Yay. Can't believe I'm about to be a graduate. I'm high school class of 2020, so I never had a graduation. This is my first time ever having a graduation. I have my backpack on because I need to find my family and give it to them so that afterwards they already have it and we can just leave. I got my balloons that were way too expensive. I'm walking to the corner to meet up with my nursing friends. I cannot express how happy I am to be graduating. It has been a long time coming. We have like an hour and a half until we're supposed to be lined up at the red panda and we walk the lawn. Then we have the nursing tenning ceremony. [Music] [Music] This is killing me. Our friends are in the port. There's a lady sticking out. Wow. [Music] [Applause] [Music] We have trap music on the right and graduation music on the left. Laura, Jim Ryan. Yes. [Music] Wow, this is scary. It's happening again. [Music] That's Harry. There's a big [Music] five. Ready to go, Carrie? My family get a better view. [Music] There they go. Thank you so much. for the children hospital. [Music] Wow. Those are the children's hospital. And there's also [Music] more people walking. My name is Jim Ryan. In addition to being the president of UVA, I am your host for today's ceremony. And most importantly, I will also officially award the degrees School of Nursing. [Applause] The candidates for the degree of bachelor of science. I confer upon you the degree of bachelor of science and I charge you to promote human health and to strive to improve the lives of persons in need. Congratulations. [Music] I am Maryannne Burnernhol and it is my pleasure to serve as the dean of the school of nursing. Welcome to the 2025 school of nursing pinning ceremony.

7wrbByIbaag,3112,213,16,HAVEN VLOG | HOPTON GOLD CARAVAN,20250525,"We are currently on our way to Great Yarmouth again. We are staying at Haven Site, but this time we're staying at a different one. Last time we stayed at Seashore and this time we are staying at Hopton. It's still on the beach and it's not that far. I think there's like 5 minutes from each location. We saw it was going to be hot this week and we looked for a last minute deal on Haven and they do last minute deals three nights and they run from Tuesdays including like your passes for swimming and stuff like that. It's £80. But we then saw which is another reason why we chose the Hopton location. They had a gold caravan. Now if you watched my last vlog we also stayed in a gold caravan. So, for three nights, it's £200, which I think is really good. Um, the weather is lovely. So, we are currently 2 hours into our journey. River has just woken up with my mom. It's just me, my mom, and River because it's the Tuesday. Everybody else is at work. I'm supposed to be at work actually, but I got the day off annual leave. We've just had to change our location because I've just remembered that we haven't packed River's shoes and you know I wanted him to be running around and exploring as much as possible and we forgot his shoes. It's because they're so new to us. They're just not at the top of the you know list. So now we are driving into Great Yarn Town Center because there's a Clark's there and we're going to get him a pair of shoes and then we're going to head there. It's currently 10 to 12 and our check-in time is between 1 and 2 anyway. So, it works well. We can get out, have a drink, and then head to Hopton. Came prepared. Oh, yeah. Guys, this cup is the tum tum cup and he really likes it. First stop is Costa before we go into Clarks and my mom took a wrong wrong turn and she's gone down a road that was for like taxis, loading, and buses, I think. So, now I'm going to get a sign. I have got the iced whipped uh white chocolate latte and a ham and cheese toasting. We have arrived. I'm going to do a quick little tour for you. This is the entrance. Got a table over here. This one doesn't have a washing machine, which our one at Seashore did. Has got a dishwasher down there. And then it's got a nice big sofa. It's also got a ver. We got some chairs out there. We're also right next to the sea. Got high chair, TV, another place to sit. So yeah, this is the living area. Also got this little bit as well. Not that we've got coats with us. Like I said, this is threebedroom. So here is the first room. Here is the second room. Me and my mom are going to have these two rooms because we have River's Travel Cot and that will fit here. I mean, I could stay in the same room as him, but I just feel like I don't know, would wake each other up. It's got a lovely getting ready bit here. And then an on suite. And then there's big wardrobes there. There's also more space out here. This is the bathroom. I'd be interested to know how much this place cost compared to Seashore because the bathroom, obviously, I had the luxury of the bath. Um, but there was two showers in that one. And I mean, it just looks like your normal shower. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's lovely, but it's just interesting how um different the gold caravans are. I mean, I knew exactly what this one would look like because obviously they have pictures all online, but yeah, we are now going to unpack and I'll check in with you once that's done. Come on, show off your new shoes. Why are you walking onelegged? We've got quite a lot of foodie bits. That's nice. Let me get them out and then I'll show you. We've got the essentials. What are you doing? You reading your book? That's Tmy's too fuzzy. I've put everything away. So, we've got milk and wine. And then I bought these for River cuz we're here for three nights and I don't know where we're going to be at, what time of night. He has dinner at 5. So, just in case we're caught short, I've got three of these. And these have really good dates on them. So, we'll just take whatever ones we don't use home. And these are his favorite yogurts at the moment. We've got avocado, butter, blueberries, olives. This is some cheese so we can make some sandwiches, diet coke, and water. Then over here, we've also got some red wine, bread, pastries, some snacky bits for the evenings, eggs, coffee, some Belvita's weabicks. These are just a load of snacky bits for us and River. oranges, apples, beans, and that's everything we've got foodwise. We plan on eating out. So, they're just snacky bits and breakfast bits. So, this is our lodge. And then, actually, you can see the sea right there. So, we're going to go and take a little walk around. We've literally just realized that it's 10 to 3 and hasn't had his second nap, but he did have a really long nap this morning. So, yeah, we're going to go and have a look at the sea. Hopefully go straight to sleep. I mean, he looks it have arrived. I won't film to the left where the steps are because loads of people standing there. Oh my god, I am freezing. It's really nice and warm, but right here with all these wind, it's so cold. River is successfully asleep. We have come to walk around like it's so lovely and green here. It's a ghost town. It's It's actually a ghost town. Um but yeah, so we're sitting outside catching the sun. It's lovely and warm. It's really, really hot. But it was not hot by the water. It was so windy. Oh, here we go. Our wine. Two glasses of lovely. Lovely. Thank you very much. Cheers. Nice. This cost just under£19 for two. That is bad, isn't it? The bottle is 22. We ain't going to have a bottle now, are we? Come on. It's super. My iPhone needs to cool down before I can use it. It's only apparently 17, but it feels so hot. Guys, we have just come to check out the soft plate. We're both burnt from that. I'm going to film on my phone for this bit. So, um, goodbye. River, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Rivers on the horse sea. We have come to have a look at the arcades. Honestly, so quiet. Guys, I've decided I need to get Invisalign again. Are you playing? Um, even though I have a fixed wire, my teeth are still moving behind these and it's really, really bothering me. Me mom thinks she's in with the banana, but she's only got a few pennies. Oh no, there's load down there. What's she doing? Oh, banana's gone. Oh, what? I just missed it. Got the banana. Banana. Banana. We've just quickly run back to the caravan. I've got River's bag. I've just filled up his water again, changed his nappy. Did you hear that? If you didn't, good. Um, and we are now going to go for dinner. It is 10 to 5, so his dinner time is usually at 5:00. So, we've decided to go down there today for dinner. Are you ready? Yeah. Okay, let's go. I've got gaman chips and pineapple. River's got spaghetti bolognese and peas. And my mom has Cajun pasta. Good morning. And it is now Wednesday. I didn't vlog anything else after dinner yesterday because we came back to the room. Not room, the caravan. And then I fell asleep on the sofa. Ow. Ow. Anyway, I've just made River's breakfast. He slept fine in the Travel Cot. He didn't wake up once and he's got weabix for breakfast. Yay. So, I'm going to feed him this, but I thought I would just say good morning. We're up and at um at 6 in the morning. So, bye-bye. I'm going to eat my breakfast. Yummy, yummy. Eat my breakfast. This is good. Is it? Yeah. Where are we? I'm watching you. Look. How is he learn? Leave my coffees alone. Oh my goodness. We're going to go to Lower today. So, we're going to get ready. River's had his first nap. We wasn't very productive. Tidied up a little bit. And also, we're going to go to M&S and get some dinner. Last night, the dinner was a disaster. River did not like that spaghetti bolognese. I don't think it was spaghetti bolognese. It was literally spaghetti and mints. So, we're going to definitely have dinner at home today. Let's get ready for the day. Say woohoo. Say nutnut. This is River's little top for the day. This is the first thing of Well, I've got a few things now, but this is the first thing he's wearing. That's from Zara. We're just in the car on our way to what's it called again? Lower stuff. Soft stuffed. And it's a bit cloudier today. Actually, it was cloudier here, but it was more blue skies at the caravan. So, it's literally 13 minutes away, but yeah, it's saying it's 15°. It's a bit windy, but still a nice day. We've come to one of the peers, but it's just like even the ice cream place isn't open. I really wanted an ice cream today. So, we're just feeding River cuz it's gone his lunchtime. And then we're going to decide what to do. So, I've got my favorite. I've got a cheese sandwich. He's yummy. Is that better now you've eaten? I'm going to walk over there. There's a coffee house thing there. We just decided it looked like there was some beach huts and stuff down there. So, there might be somewhere to get ice cream. We'll see. It's very windy. I'm a bit cold. Woohoo. Speedy Gonzalez. Yay. We've come to this place. It's actually really busy considering everywhere else looked quite dead. And I've got a latte and my mom's got a coffee and we're just waiting for our food. So I will show you that when it comes. We've got lunch to share today. So we've got a tuna melt panini and chips. Just coming to walk down the beach now. Trying to get River to sleep. If only it was 25°. We have about 1 minute to spare till our um swim time. So, we literally made it back in a panic. But the only thing about this one that's different to Seashore is that it's all glass. So, everyone can watch you, and that just makes me feel really uncomfortable. Like, people can literally go and have a drink and then watch you and your kiddies going for a little swim. That just feels not normal to me. Do you know what I mean? You excited? Yeah. No, too busy washing the car. We're back from swimming. I feel absolutely knackered. Got myself a Diet Coke. And also picked up these earlier in M&S. Now I'm kind of regretting it because why are they so big? Cuz when you look at them, they're not that big. But I needed some brown sunglasses because mine are black. All mine are black. So I thought these are cool. What about with my hair down? Let's see if it makes a difference. Cuz the thing is with sunglasses, half the time you just use them to keep the hair off your face. You don't even have them down. Do they look less ridiculous with my hair down or not? Really? Yeah. They are even. They even look big on my head. Look, they were £15 from M&S. Anyway, we got dinner for tonight. We both picked up a pasta salad from M&S. We've also got some olives, some red wine. We also got dinner for tomorrow. I'll show you that tomorrow. But yes, swimming was brilliant. The pool was really warm. River loved it. So, yeah, we're gonna give him dinner here. Then we're going to go to the clubhouse for the kids entertainment cuz that's on between is it 6:00 and 8? Yeah, 6:00 and 8. And then we'll come back and we'll have dinner. And I need to edit tonight. I didn't do it yesterday. I was so tired just I just fell asleep on the sofa. Oh, these are 100 UV protection. That's good. Because usually when you buy shitty sunglasses, they don't have any down with down hair. Still not 100% square. I like the color though. I like the the cut sort of shell you can get there. Yeah, but they're like dark enough. Like a lot of them are um I'll go Primark. They probably cost me £3 in Primark rather than 15. But then the Primark ones, they probably don't have 100% UV protection, do they? And these eyes are looking haggarded. So, I think I need some extra sun protection. It's now 6:00. We are just walking around to the clubhouse for the kids entertainment. River goes to bed at 7 7 half 7. So, we've got him in his pajamas coming down and we're going to go check it out. When I say cannonballs, everyone needs to crouch down. George would like this next one. We're back home now. I feel like the cold has smacked me in the face, basically. Um, this is what my mom got. Prawn layered salad. And I got the chicken and bacon layered salad. We've also got some olives, a glass of red wine. Also, I can't remember if I told you guys earlier, but our dishwasher is basically moldy. Has it got mold in it? You looked at it. Black. Yeah, it's like black. And what? I said we should have complained. really cuz we might have got an upgrade to the seafront or something. It is gross. We had to take everything out the dishwasher and hand wash it and then we've been paranoid that all the things that we've been eating off have been in the dishwasher. Anyway, this salad has pasta in it as well. I used to be obsessed with this back in the day. Was it always? Cuz I hate the prawn one. I would never eat that. Way everything is cut up is just as perfect. Good morning. It is Thursday, our last full day. And this is what we can see. Unfortunately, it is a horrible day. It's really quite cold. It's 14°, but it feels Oh, 12. Apparently, it's going to get sunnier later. So, we live in hope. So, we're currently on our way to Tesco. We might look at the clothes because to be fair, the outfit I was wearing today, I couldn't wear cuz I wouldn't be warm enough. But, this does keep me warm. I might be all right in this to be honest with you. Um, and I want to get some cold and flu tablets because last night when I was asleep, well, I wasn't asleep. I was awake most of the night. I thought I was going to die. Genuinely, I couldn't stop coughing and I had to keep coughing into the blanket because the walls are so thin. I didn't want to wake River up. But, can you believe it? He slept through again. I mean, I know he sleeps through at home, but I really thought at the in the travel car, he wouldn't sleep through, but yeah, Tesco is. If they've got a cafe there, we might also have a coffee. Beans on toast. I have a cherry bakewell loaf. And we've got some lattes. I've got to talk quietly cuz asleep, but we're back at the caravan. Did I end up getting anything warm to wear? No. Did I buy a dress for summer? Yes. Well, I got this for holiday really, but I can probably wear it whenever. It's just a midi dress and it's navy and white. Oh, yeah. And I also got a new phone case yesterday, but I forgot about it. Left it in the pram in the boot of the car. But yeah, we're just now going to wait for him to wake up and then we are going to go swimming and then I do want to take him to the soft play bit. Sun's out a little bit, but it's still very gray, cloudy. Look what River's found. About to show you what we've got for dinner, but it's a bit chaotic. But River's got his curry. Both got tikka masala. And then we've got these mini naans. These smell really good. These are from M&S. Can you believe this is 6:00 p.m.? Look at that beautiful sky. Um, we are now going to go to the clubhouse. The Rory situation I assume will be on. Keep walking. Good boy. And go soft play. You know, just kill some time before bed. Yeah. What can you see? We had to get the obligatory picture. So, what are you doing, River? Are you kicking your face? Mommy. Mommy. What are you doing? Oh, are you laying down? We're now home. It's our last night. I don't know if you can hear that, by the way. It's the music from the clubhouse cuz we're not too far from it. Literally right around the corner. It's so loud. I'm even surprised that doesn't wake River up. Anyway, I'm just packing. We have to be out by 10:00 in the morning, which is when River has his first nap. So, I'm hoping that he will sleep as well. He did sleep as well as he did on the way here. But yeah, again, we're just having a chilled evening in. My mom's reading her book. I've literally been aimlessly scrolling on TikTok. I did bring my laptop to do some editing and I've literally edited about I would say a fifth of the video. I will see you guys in the morning ready for the morning rush because well to be fair say that river wakes up at quart 6. So that is nearly 4 hours until we have to leave from when he wakes up. So we will be able to get stuff done in the morning. Where are your ears? Where's your ears? Good boy. Oh, look. He's really bumped his head there on the table. And guys, I've woke up this morning. I think I've got a sty now. Seriously. Oh, it's really, really painful. He's obsessed with these books that have just like one page on No, one picture on each page. He just loves books, honestly. He picks them up and carries them over to you like, ""Read this to me."" Attempts to say duck. Well, actually, it's bad cuz I' I've been saying duck duck. Look what mommy's got. Ready? We got What's that? Duck. Duck. Dog. Woof. Woof. Mouse. We are ready to go. River is so tired. I'm making it out perfectly just in time for his nap. But I'm going to end the video here. Sorry if it wasn't that exciting. We didn't really do a lot, did we? No, not too much. I'm going to wrap the video up here. Hope you guys enjoyed this one. Who is it? If you did, what have they got to do? Put a thumbs up.",0.044,0.822,0.134,0.9999

2KQUR7kklgo,5502,232,23,New Balance 933 Skate Sneaker Review: Pros and Cons!,20250525,"So, the 993 had a baby with the numeric 480, which is a skate shoe. This would be the results. And this is the NB Numeric Andrew Reynolds 933. First of all, look at the beautiful box. I love that they gave the new model its own special box, and I think it looks great. Uh, the Numeric line has been pretty solid from New Balance. If you haven't tried it thus far, the 480s are excellent. But, um, this model, dudes, literally from the first images, I was like, yo, they have like a banger in this shoe. I got these on the launch and uh soon after this colorway sold out. The other color way is available in very small sizes. They do have a Gray Ace colorway that's going to be launching on 526. So hopefully you guys will get your hands on those. This video will be sponsored by New Balance. They don't dictate anything I say in the video or anything, but I really appreciate them for helping sponsor the content on this channel. It goes a long ways. Uh and greatly appreciate you guys for supporting that partnership as well. There's a lot of pros to this model, not very many cons. I'm going to go over them uh in a list with you guys that I have written down. But I'm telling you guys, man, this is just a beautiful, beautiful shoe. I wore these immediately. Wore these out and about. Kids baseball games. Went skating in them a little bit as well. I'm not doing kick flips or ollies or anything like that, but we were cruising down a freshly paved road. I'm telling you, it was beautiful. Uh kid was on the scooter and I was wearing these. And um dude, like these are going to be beautiful for those people that are like serious skateboarders, but also this is a shoe in my opinion that you can casual. And I think uh they just do a beautiful job with a lot of a lot of things in this. So first things first, let's give you some information what New Balance says about these. Inspired by legendary skateboarder Andrew Reynolds, these skate shoes blend premium cushioning with a heritage design for all-around comfort. Absorb in the midsole absorbs the impact through the combination of cushioning and compression resistance. Designed inspired by heritage and running. As I mentioned, this is Andrew Reynolds new signature model for New Balance. And they weigh about 15.5 O. The retail is only $130. And that is uh pretty incredible for what you get because as soon as you pull these out of the box and you look at them, the the suede is in incredible for the price point. The fact that they they have it so buttery smooth. This is unbelievably good at a retail of $130. But but that's not really anything new for New Balance. Like this is a 473 model and the suedes on this is crazy good as well on like a $100 model. So, they definitely have nice quality suedes and you get the benefit of that on the 933s. By the way, I will have a review on the 471s and the 2010s down here if you guys are new to the channel. Make sure you subscribe and uh click the bell and it'll notify you when I post those videos. So, why did Andrew Reynolds create this model? Well, I was doing a little bit of research and he was like obsessed with the idea of having a running sneaker as like a skate shoe. It's something that he's always been wanting. He said he would want to wear a pair of like 993s, 992s, and so on if he had like a guard in the shoe to help him kick flip. So, I love the idea of them taking that concept and then bringing it to life in this model. And it sounds like he was very, very specific on his details on what he wanted with the shoe. If something was just a little bit too thick, like around the collar or something, he would want it reduced just a little bit. And I think that that attention to details made this shoe uh so much better than what maybe it could have been because the amount of padding that they have in the shoe is the perfect amount. Like, it's not overly padded. I think for skate shoes, a lot of times you picture like majorly puffy tongues. It's a puffy tongue, but it's not so crazy big uh that you you feel like it's only for skating. Same as the cushioning around the collar. It's very nice and well cushioned, but it's not so overly cushioned where you feel like it's a big chunky skate shoe. It doesn't even resemble a skate shoe when you look at the shoe until you look at this midsole and the build that they have on this midsole. It's incredible. And I think part of the reason why, you know, it's a skate shoe is because of how incredibly flat the midsole is. So, the midsole very, very flat comparison to like a running sneaker. Uh but that is again very very intentional by the design. Now you do have like a shank plate in the midfoot of the shoe as well as uh the absorb technology in the heel which I love that you can push on it here and it's like exposed uh and you can actually see what you have there. It's also in the forefoot as well. Another intentional detail to the shoe that I really like is all of the fused layers underneath the suede. So you get a little bit of a peak of it under the toe cap here, but also up the tongue and then also as an underlay up the back collar as well. So some nice extra reinforcement there. And then you do have some extra stitching uh in the front right here as well as you could see underneath the toe box. I'm assuming for kick clips and stuff like that that will be very helpful. You also do have a support collar on the back which is something that we see on a lot of the running shoes. It does say controlled reaction device on that. And again, I like the little peak of the absorb in the green on the back here. I like that they intentionally uh made it green so you can actually see the different layers and different like materials that they use because they have so many extra details in this midsole. Like it's just not rubber midsole. Like there's so many extra elements. It's nice that they um highlight them in different ways. You also have some extra reflective details. Something that we've seen on New Balance sneakers a lot. The ends on the sides are reflective. The heel is reflective. So, pros and cons list for the shoe. Starting off with the pros. First of all, it looks great. It really does look like a running sneaker that they married in together with a skate shoe. I think that the panels and the overlays look fantastic. The top down view is beautiful as well. Just look at all the panels and stuff on the sides. This is the 991 V2. has a lot of similarities to uh some of these other models out there. We have a lot of the same panels that they have on the running sneakers, which I think again they just did a tremendously good job with that. And you know, normally on the running sneakers, there's more mesh up the sides and stuff, but here they obviously reinforced it with the suede because you need the extra reinforcement in that area when you're skating in it. You made a skating shoe that is a skating shoe. Functionally, it's definitely one that professional skaters can wear, but also it's something that you can casual. So, the versatility of this model is definitely there. Especially for people that want a flat pair of sneakers, not anything that has like a lot of curvature from a runners, but they like the look of a runner. I feel like this is a W. Also, I already mentioned it, but the quality of materials, major pro there, especially for that price point, which is again another pro. $130 premium build quality, premium materials, a very, very nice combination for that price. It also has a very technically strong build from the midsole design and creation with the exposed absorb with strategic placement, but also uh the shank plate in the middle. And the technical build doesn't just stop at the midsole. Again, it goes to the upper with a fused layers and everything else with all the different overlays. They just did a really really solid job creating the shoe. Another pro is the fit is true to size in my opinion. I have a 9.5. These fit me perfect. 9.5 was the way to go. And you can see this colorway actually came with two sets of laces as well. I did both of them just so you guys can see what they look like. Which one do you think looks the better, the white or this olive color? Uh, I'm kind of torn. I kind of like the olive color, honestly. But, uh, this one kind of freshens it up and makes it a little bit more springy. So, I don't know. Both of them are good. That being said, the launch colorway I think is another pro. This one specifically is fire. The other colorway is a little bit darker. Uh, but I really, really like this colorway. It kind of has like a fall vibe with it. I love the suede color, the hits of gray, the little hits of that burnt orange, and then like olive as well. A little bit of a darker tan color also. like it just has a really nice blend of everything together, but with that little pop of that fluorescent green. I don't know, something about it makes these things super super nice and very wearable. One that I was just wearing to a baseball game. By the way, my kid has the best baseball game ever. He a triple, a double, a single, he caught a pop fly, and he had two strikeouts at the mound. It was a beautiful, beautiful game. But anyway, I got a lot of compliments wearing these out of the game. People were looking at them asking what model they were, and I was telling them. But yeah, anyway, lots of compliments on this colorway. And the last pro in my opinion is it's chunky but not too chunky. It's a dad shoe but not too much of a dad shoe. Like it's a perfect hybrid between a runner, dad shoe, skate shoe. It's fun to be able to see companies bring new models out uh with collaborations like Andrew Reynolds in this case, but have like a lot of pure intentions behind the product that they're releasing and then really just letting it go and seeing where uh it sticks. And like, yes, of course, skateboarders are going to love this shoe, but I feel like this is one of those shoes if you're a fan of the 990s and you're a fan of like the numeric line. This is the perfect filler for all of the the above, especially at that price point of 130. Like, honestly, they could have gone on a different direction and been more expensive, but that 130 price point is clutch. Like, it's premium for a skate shoe. Skate shoes are usually like $90, $100 or something like that. Maybe 130. Uh, but 130 you're definitely getting like a more premium product and you definitely get a more premium product in the delivery of this point. As for the cons, the only thing I can really think of is the accessibility is not very good because they sold out. Like I love the fact that um they did sell out. They do have a couple other sizes in the other color way and again I'll link the new color way that drops on the 26th. Hopefully you guys will be able to get your hands on that one cuz it's a really nice gray color way that I think um is very fitting for New Balance in general. But hopefully they'll get more restocks and they'll be more readily available because it really is a beautiful shoe. And then the only other con that I can think of is the overall firmness of the midsole is a lot firmer than say a pair of the 99Xs. So like the 991 V2s and 990 V6s, a lot softer on feet than something like this, but that is very intentional the way that this is built. So if you like kind of a firmer sneaker underfoot, this is definitely a good one. Especially since it's very flat. Uh it's multiaceted. You could use it for biking, skating, and so on. Uh but it is very good for daily as well. I would say if you're looking for the comfier side of sneakers though, obviously there's the 1080V 14s that I absolutely love and so on. But uh but this is this is a beautiful beautiful shoe for the price point and it's very exciting to see a new model that comes out that is done again so expertly well. Anyways, I really like these. Andrew Reynolds did a great job on these. The Numeric team or whoever on the New Balance side, amazing work. really love what they were able to create and it really opens my eyes and makes me want to look at the other numeric line and see what else they have out there cuz I've tried a handful of them before um and all of them have like been good but this is like the best of the best from what I've tried. But have a good one and hopefully see you back for some more content. night. Peace guys.",0.008,0.766,0.226,1.0
nDE_8v8eDwI,2250,28,3,F1 25 Review - Is It Worth Playing? | Analysis of Gameplay Demo,20250525,"The F1 series has been pretty consistent since 2020, but F-125 is aiming to shake things up, especially with the revamped My Team mode. So, what's new? What's better, and where does the game still stumble? Let's start with the biggest change, My Team. Since its introduction in F12020, this mode has stayed pretty safe. You were a driver and team owner, juggling two roles. In F-125, that concept is gone. Now you're purely the team owner managing two drivers instead of being one yourself. This shift adds a more strategic and managementheavy feel. You now face tough calls. Who gets the next car upgrade? How do you handle a contract dispute between drivers? Who do you back during the season when one is outperforming the other? The game play is no longer just about driving. You're managing engineering, personnel, and corporate departments. XP points earned during your races can be spent on upgrading these teams. You'll even need to keep your fan rating and sentiment in check. Sentiment, new to this year, affects your team's reputation and even determines which drivers are willing to join your squad later on. This deeper management system isn't for everyone, but for those who enjoy the back end of F1, it adds a layer of realism that the mode previously lacked. Facility upgrades are now more detailed. You're no longer just hitting a button and getting an upgrade. You need to make calls about where to grow. Do you want to boost engineering for faster R&D development? Or perhaps invest in personnel to improve driver performance? These choices come with real impact. You can grow each department at your own pace, but each upgrade costs time and money. Plus, each facility brings unique advantages. Want faster part production? Go with engineering. Want more sponsorship benefits? Corporate is your guy. The new team HQ adds some immersion to this, too. You can now see and manage the number of people working in each department. It may seem cosmetic, but it helps you feel more like a principal running an actual team, not just clicking menus. The R&D system has been split into research and development. Previously, you just select a part and wait for it to be delivered. Now, it's more strategic. First, you research the part using resource points. Then, you decide how to develop it. Want to work on two parts at once? It'll be slower but cost effective. or you can rush one and get it quicker, but then you'll need to decide which of your two cars gets it. These small but meaningful choices make the upgrade system feel less robotic and more like realworld engineering planning. Graphically, F-125 makes a solid leap. Certain tracks like Bahrain, Suzuka, and Imila have been LAR scanned for better detail in realism. Even foliage around the track has been updated to match what you'd see in real life. It's subtle, but hardcore fans will notice. Reverse versions of Silverstone, Austria, and Xandvort add something new for those who want to mix up their race days. Meanwhile, PC players with high-end GPUs can enjoy path tracing, an advanced ray tracing system for more immersive lighting. But unfortunately, this is PC exclusive. Car customization gets a surprising boost. A brand new decal editor lets you put detailed logos anywhere on the car. Now you can use gradients, different fonts, and replace sponsor logos with your own designs. It's more powerful than ever and gives creative players more freedom. Also, engine noises now vary based on the supplier you choose, Red Bull Power Trains, Ferrari, Renault, or Mercedes. It's a small touch, but it adds immersion. And yes, special edition liveries are also back across all the major modes. Breaking Point returns with its third installment. It continues the story of Connor Sport Racing and lets you choose between two different drivers, each offering a unique perspective. The acting and presentation are top tier again, making it feel like a playable F1 drama. There are now four difficulty levels to help casual players ease into the story. Choices you make can also influence the ending. And for the first time, Breaking Point transitions directly into career mode, letting you continue with the same drivers and teams. F-125 doesn't miss a chance to capitalize on the upcoming Brad Pitt F1 movie. Players who get the iconic edition can race with the fictional team right away. Later, you'll even be able to play movie themed scenarios that blend real footage with in-game events. Gameplay is color- graded to match the movie scenes. It's a clever crossover, but it's also worth noting that most of this content is locked behind the iconic edition. In F1 World, a new feature called invitationals lets you unlock unique one-time races. You can find them by just driving around. These races have special modifiers like different weather or gameplay tweaks, and you can invite friends to join in for extra rewards. Driver of the Day returns, this time with a new focus on clean driving and fair play. There's also a new flashback system that now follows your car's rewind instead of just snapping back to a previous moment. Even though you're more of a team principle now, you still get to race. You can select which of your two drivers to control for each weekend. During team setup, you'll pick your two drivers from a limited selection of F2 talent. In the demo, choices like Victor Martinez and Rtomo Miata were available. It's a bit underwhelming to start with such a limited pool, but you'll get access to the full F1 driver market as your career progresses. Your budget affects almost everything. You can pick to start as a back marker, midfield team, or frontr runner. That choice determines your initial facility level, available cash, and the quality of the drivers and engine you can afford. Engine providers, each with unique power and reliability stats also eat into your starting money. So, their strategy even before your first lap. Sponsorships also return, and this time, your loyalty matters. Stick with a sponsor, complete objectives, and you'll unlock better rewards. Now, for one of the disappointments, difficulty settings. F-125 still uses that vague 1/100 slider. There's no proper onboarding or adaptive difficulty, and once again, you might need to spend extra time with time trials or dummy saves just to figure out your level. Codemasters says they're working on something better in the future, but for now it's a dated and frustrating system. So, is F125 worth playing based on the demo? If you love the F1 series and want more control, better realism, and deeper systems, then yes, this one is definitely worth your attention. But if you are hoping for huge changes to the driving model or smarter difficulty systems, you might want to wait for reviews of the full release. Thanks for watching.

AKTO3_1krWU,5936,811,8,My honest review of the VIRAL FOODS in France #shorts,20250525,"This is my honest review of the viral foods I tried in the south of France. First up was this bougie restaurant in can where they literally take the plant that's sitting on your table and use it to make your olive oil dip. Everyone here seemed to be ordering this fish on fire. So I followed suit and I'm very glad I did because next to gold it might be the best fish I've ever had. From the food to the entertainment to the overall vibe, this place was absolutely worth the hype. Unlike my next spot, I had met these nice girls that were studying abroad and they told me that this place always has a line and people say it's the number one restaurant in can. And maybe it's because the fish the night before was so amazing. But I'm sorry to say this might be one of the worst meals I've ever had and I do not understand the line. Although, one line I will get behind was for this viral croissant ice cream sandwich. I don't know who at Magnum thought of hot pressing a croissant, drizzling it in honey, and then making an ice cream sandwich with it. But whoever it is, I like to marry you. So I really hope that our past croissant again",0.036,0.863,0.1,0.9102

vm0UZh6URsE,4069,483,10,"FOX and Friends 5/26/25 FULL END SHOW | FOX BREAKING NEWS TRUMP May 26, 2025",20250526,"um from making that ultimate sacrifice. We we want to remember you this morning. It's good to see you, Lisa. Charlie. Yeah, it it really is an extraordinary uh day and obviously it's important to have fun because it's Memorial Day and that's what those uh men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice uh fought and died for was for us to enjoy life. And uh but it's a humbling day. It and it's an honor to be with you guys this morning on such an important day where we remember our nation's heroes and also the reason we're free and able to do a show like this and be able to have freedom of speech and to just you know talk about what's on our mind and to tell the truth as well and so just we honor those who have fallen and we also you know thank our military men and women. So beautiful day to be on uh Lisa to that point a day of education as well especially to the next generation. Remember, there's a lot of people that have just enlisted into the military that weren't born for 911. We have a whole group of people that are in the middle of the street that are protesting that don't know anything about uh what took place uh in our country and why we had the war on ter made that ultimate sacrifice. So, we have to educate that next generation. And I think that's something that the president has made very clear that we're going to get back to the basics, not just when it comes from having a lethal force, but telling our young people, get the wokeness out, the DEI out, and more of the American history back into the into the conversation. Well, it's always it always reminds me of the the Ronald Reagan quote, you know, freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it through a bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them. And and I think that the beauty of where we are right now in a country as well, I we're already seeing recruit recruitment numbers shoot up because of President Trump because they know that he is going to protect them, that he is going to have their back, that he's not going to enter in arenas that we shouldn't be entering in, that he is going to value their lives, value their duty to this country. And um so I'm very thankful to today that we are in a different place as a country than we were under the previous administration as well. And speaking of the president, Charlie, he's going to be actually going to uh Arlington National Cemetery today. He's going to do the the reef ceremony as well. Uh I think maybe the first lady's going to be joining him as well as some of you're going to see some of the cabinet members all morning long as we honor those service members. Meanwhile, the president over the weekend had a fiery speak uh speech at um West Point uh earlier. Here's a little bit of that. Done anything you wanted. You could have gone anywhere. You could have gone to any school. Instead of sports teams and spreadsheets and software, you chose a life of service. Very important service. Instead of stock options, and I do that stuff. It's sort of boring. Honestly, compared to what you're doing, it's real boring. You chose honor and you chose sacrifice. And instead of business suits and dress shoes, you chose muddy boots and fatigues, keeping yourself in shape. Because West Point cadetses don't just have the brightest minds, you also have the bravest hearts and the noblest souls. You know, President Trump has a way of always connecting in a very real, authentic way. uh especially with uh men and women who serve and uh and it's kind of interesting, you know, when you meet these young men and women who sign up to serve, they're the most impressive people you ever meet. It is mindblowing. You know, you go to a lot of these college campuses around the country, you know, out in California, and you walk away and you're like, ""Oh man, we're doomed."" But then you get a minute to meet these young men and women who sign up to serve. Um and you spend two minutes with them, and you walk away and you say, ""Oh, no. We got it. We we got another generation and so humble, too. I I've interviewed so many, you know, veterans for my podcast and on my show. And so humble, you know, they're it's not about them. It's about the broader country. They're so proud of their service. They would do it again in a heartbeat. And and also just leadership matters, right? And here we have a guy with President Trump. He didn't need to be president of the United States. He had a great life before. He was a billionaire. He chose to serve this country in his capacity as president of the United States as commander-in-chief because he wanted to make a difference because he believes in America. He was upset about the direction our country was heading in and he also didn't need to run again particularly after everything they were doing to the guy. I think I think he Lisa he also had a way during that speech of putting it in perspective. You know he doesn't shy away from being a billionaire in that he's been quite successful. That's true. But he also says to them but it's boring right? You you chose the noble way uh to defend our country. You get a lot more action than I am am I am successful. I don't hide from that. But the route that you took was riskier. It was better. It was more noble. And I think uh the question is is who's going to be his air parent? And JD Vance gave a speech to naval grads as well. And this is what he had to say. I'm not just giving another political speech. I'm your vice president. And the minute you walk off this stage with your diploma and your commission, you will be officers in the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. And that is an incredible thing. You will be leaders of men and women in our armed forces. The era of uncontested US dominance is over. Today, we face serious threats in China, Russia, and others nations determined to beat us in every single domain. Technology has lowered the cost of disruption. And so, we must be, all of us, not just smarter. We got to make sure that we we send our troops to war. We do it with the right tools. I mean, just a strong speech from the vice president, Lisa. Well, and JD Vance, the vice president is someone who chose to enlist, right? This is someone who chose to serve our country. And all those naval grads, they can look up to the vice president as someone who this is someone who pulled himself up from the bootstraps, right? He came from nothing. And look where he is as vice president of the United States right now. And also just that message again, I I think this is why military recruitment is so high. Yeah. because they can trust the leadership of this administration that if we go to war, it's because we have to. It's because we need to. It's not necessary. It's not careless. It's thoughtful. And it's what we have to do as a country. And it's and it's an administrationwide uh uh new stance, an America first stance. Uh and and I loved watching uh Department of Defense Secretary uh Pete Seagth uh over the weekend uh bringing kids out to uh with buckets of soap, soapy water and brushes to clean the uh Korean War Memorial. It, you know, and I I wish every single kid in America got that opportunity. Over the weekend, I I got to go out to Indianapolis to see the Indy500. It's my first time being there. They're very intentional about doing that on Memorial Day because they want to recognize uh Memorial Day and all of the people who served and paid that ultimate sacrifice. And I have to say, man, it was I'm like I'm all out of chills after this weekend. It was mind-blowing. They had uh it also coincided with the 250th birthday of the US Army. And so when you have the pace car at the beginning that opens it and Tom Brady's driving the pace car going around the track, they had two army helicopters right overhead and it was like the most American thing you've ever seen with a fly over and there and of course it begins most importantly with taps and the bugler plays taps and I'm telling you it's over 300,000 people in the stands. You could not hear a peep as everyone stood up and listened to taps. But watch a little bit of that moment. This is the pace lap for America to honor Memorial Day and the US Army's 250th birthday. To all the men and women of the US Army and the 160th Special Operations Group, happy birthday from all of us. This is something special. [Music] [Applause] you know, um, India has always been a quite Americana, but there is this this theme and it I went out with some of my vet friends last night that we are so back that the country is so back that the military that we're respected on the world stage and it it it's this message of that the deaths of the men and women that paid the ultimate sacrifice is no longer in vain because you got a president that has their back as Lisa talked about he's not going to be clear uh careless when it comes to the deployment and we're going to build the biggest baddest milit under his leadership. And you got Hexth, who wrote a whole book about the dysfunction that was going on in that building and now he's redirecting it and you had this beautiful moment for the whole world to see at the Indy500. I can't imagine if it looks this cool on camera, I can't imagine being there, Charlie. But, you know, you're right, Lawrence. I I think a lot of this past election, it was about American exceptionalism. That's right. That was the whole message from President Trump. We can be great again. we can be the American the the the United States of America that we remember, you know, from before Biden. And then when we heard the vice president speaking earlier, he was talking about the new threats that exist now. Those threats, they grew under the previous president, right? We we we saw a closer relationship between Iran and and Russia and China. The world changed because of weakness. And it seems so simple, but peace through strength, but you can't have peace unless you have strength. And now we have strength. again to the point of the broader conversation that we've been having on the couch and and not only were there a lot of Americans there, there were also a lot of uh international fans there as well and they got to see this as well which I just absolutely loved of course and it's a contest and you know cuz that's what we do in America. We compete and we like to do dangerous things. Um and Alex Paloo the first Spaniard to ever win the race won the race yesterday and he'll be come joining us uh later this morning. unfulfilled. It's beautiful. I just cannot imagine driving that fast, dude. 240 miles an hour going around that thing. I mean, and and we went out in these little uh Corvettes going like 105. And it was kind of You're up against the wall. It's kind of scary. I think I'd pee my fast. That's fast. I mean, I like adventure, but that's a little too much for me. It's a little too much adventure, but I admire Yeah. This is us going out. This is us going out going a raging 105 m an hour. Even that seems so I mean you know when I was younger I drove you know a lot faster than I probably should have but I just can't imagine. But you were going 240. No I I obviously not. So we've been uh as we are are covering the ND500. I know there's a lot of young gals as well uh that that watch it. Uh but a lot of men has been a part of that and and and the president has made it his mission to show up to all of these things. The UFC, wrestling matches, going to the barber shop, going to places where he can connect with his people. But the Democrats have found it almost impossible football games to connect with young men because they have no authenticity as well. And so they're investing into this recruitment effort. This the New York Times puts it this way. The perspectus for one new 20 million effort obtained by the times aims to reverse the erosion of democratic support among young men, especially online. It is co-enamed Sam Short for speaking American men. A strategic plan and promises an investment to study the syntax language and content so incredible content that can gains attention and verality in these spaces. It recommends buying advertisement and video games among other things. Above all, we must shift from a mor more moraleizing tone. It urges urges. Um, this is I mean, how how are you guys going to make this work? Maybe you should start by not trying to buy ads and everything. It's just going going to talk with men. Unlike Leah Thomas, I'm an actual woman. And uh, but here's the thing. You can't buy authenticity. And that's what Democrats are desperately trying to be authentic. and you can't buy it, you can't pay for it, you just have to be. And that's why President Trump connects so well with men. This is a guy who actually loves sports, right? He grew up playing sports. He He's always, you know, you know, been all about sports. So that and then also for the longest time, the Democrat party and the left, they told men that they were toxic. They pushed them down. They told them they were evil. And then now they're wondering why there's backlash, Charlie. Right. Yeah. And and the thing is about Trump is he's never pretended to be anything else. And they sense it immediately. People sense it when you try to pretend to be something you're not. Well, you had Tim Walls that couldn't shoot the gun. And I'm like, why did you go out there and do that? You wouldn't see the president. Now, to the president's credit, his sons, Don Jr. and Eric are are sportsman shooters, but you didn't see the president going out there shoot because he doesn't that's not what he does. He goes to the fights. He loves the blood sports. He loves competition. And he's just being himself. Meanwhile, the Democrats are struggling just just in this moment. Can we also just add that Tim Walls wanted to put tampons in the boy's bathroom. So, you know, I think maybe that could be where the disconnect is as well. That's a little bit thought bubble. Yeah, exactly. All right, turning now to your headlines. DHS Secretary Christine Gnome is in Israel this morning honoring two Israeli embassy staffers who were killed outside the Capitol Jewish Museum in Washington DC last week. know that Iran and Sarah's lives will be of significance and will matter and will bring a unity among us that will help us defeat our enemies. This memorial service coming on the heels of Gnome's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night where she voiced her support for Israel and its handling of the ongoing war. Secretary Gnome will be joining us later this morning to talk about her visit. A total of 12 people are now accused of helping a group of inmates break out of a New Orleans prison earlier this month after five more people were arrested over the weekend, including the father of one of the escapees.

Roads and airports across the US getting filled up with holiday travelers over the weekend. TripleA projecting that more than 45 million people will travel at least 50 miles between Thursday and today. That's 1.4 million more than last year. Thank you for lower gas prices.

For the 37th consecutive year, the demonstration ride began outside the Pentagon and rolled through the streets of our nation's capital to call attention to the prisoners of war and military members missing in action. And those are your headlines. Absolutely. Welcome. Doug Dynasty star Phil Robertson has passed away at the age of 79 years old just months after his battle with Alzheimer's disease was revealed to the public. Ty Pyro is here with the details. Good morning, Todd. What can you tell us? Sorry to bring you this news, but it is the news. Phil Robertson, the patriarch behind one of America's most prominent hunting families, passing away over the weekend. Robertson was born and raised in Louisiana, would go on to play football at Louisiana Tech, where he was the starting quarterback over NFL legend Terry Bradshaw. Then in 1972, Robertson founded the hunting company Duck Commander. And in the five decades since, he built an empire, eventually rising to fame with the premiere of the reality TV series Duck Dynasty, which followed him and followed his family. Robertson, a man of deep faith, often used this platform to spread the word of God, even sharing his faith. Right here on Fox and Friends a few times. We show a historical account of what happens to empires, to nations, to cultures when you remove God as the firm basis for your freedom. It is religion and morality which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand. his family breaking the news of his death on Sunday in an Instagram post writing, quote, ""We celebrate today that our father, husband, and grandfather, Phil Robertson, is now with the Lord."" Going on to say, quote, ""We are grateful for his life on earth and will continue the legacy of love for God and love for others until we see him again."" Robertson's son Jace also posting in part, ""He will be missed, but we know he is in good hands and our family is good because God is very good. We will see him again. Meanwhile, a fellow Louisiana native House Speaker Mike Johnson posting this last night calling Robertson quote one of Louisiana's favorite sons. While offering prayers to the family, Robertson leaves behind five children, 16 grandchildren and his wife, Miss Kay. Back over to you guys. Thanks, Todd. Thank you, Todd. What a what a giant of a man. Such a great man. the Robertson family um have they've been so kind to not only our network but to me personally. I've been to their house several times and just a Phil is he was you know that the media tried to bash this guy because he's such a strong Christian but the whole message that Phil has always told the American public is that I'm an imperfect guy but I believe u that Jesus makes up the difference and his family they did not just innovate the entire duck hunting business but sharing the gospel every single day without fear at all. Lisa. Well, and also just a testament to strong marriages in the family throughout as well. Belief in God, belief in America. So, all very positive things, which is probably why he was attacked by some on the left. Yeah. And and he leaves behind uh three generations of of very fine people. And our thoughts are with with Miss Kay and and the entire Robertson family, especially Miss Kay, who I will say this, and I'm sorry to my family, but Miss Kay has the best meatloaf recipe. I've ever had. And she wraps the meatloaf with bacon. So, Miss K, we are thinking of you. We know that Phil is in a better place. And um I will see y'all real soon. Although you might get yourself in a little bit of trouble with your family with my family. All right. Well, the Department of Veterans Affairs working faster than ever to clear a backlog from the Biden administration. VA Secretary uh Doug Collins on the importance of taking care of our day. Another campaign promise kept. This one for America's Heroes. The Department of Veteran Affairs cutting the backlog for disability compensation, slashing it below 200,000 for the first time since March of 2023. VA Secretary Doug Collins joins us now with an update. Good morning, Mr. Secretary. Good morning, L. Good to see you. So, this was a promise made, a promise kept. This is something that you have to review very quickly. How did you get it done? What's the latest on this? Well, the latest on is it's still going down. It's is we've put focus on it. I think what really what happens in in life as anything else, what gets measured gets done. And one of the things that I've told our department is that people look at our disability backlogs. They look at our weight times because those are the easiest thing metrics to understand whether members of Congress or just the general public. But there's no sense that somebody should have earned benefits and then have to wait months or or and even sometimes unfortunately closer to a year to get an answer on their benefits. So we're putting an emphasis on it. Our my deputy uh secretary Paul Lawrence has been put in charge of it. I put him in specifically saying let's get this backlog down and it's below 200 and keeping on going down. You know, Mr. Secretary, I'm always fascinated of some of the attacks on you from the media being how that you are a veteran yourself and you take this very personally. What has been your biggest obstacle in this department? From what I hear from my sources, it was a complete mess and it's been a mess for years. I think the biggest obstacle we face is that we've uh we've become very comfortable as a department. We got some great employees. We got some great folks who want to help veterans, but they got very much uh used to just doing it the same way and not being challenged. I want to be challenged them to be the absolute best they can be. And I think the biggest thing we faced in these first, you know, well over 100 days now is just the rumor and innuendo. It's amazing me how many members of Congress, members of the media would rather take a bad story about the VA, something that they would rather, you know, put doubt into our veterans instead of saying, ""How do we make this better?"" instead of working it. So the minute I tried to make change into a system that was broken and inherently having problems for 10 years, even the GAO said so I mean when you try to make changes and they want to attack you, it tells me they have some interest in keeping it the same. Well, I have no interest in keeping it the same. I only have one interest and that's our veterans. And there's a lot of veterans that are cheer cheering you on today. Speaking of our veterans, I I want to get your message on this Memorial Day as we honor and remember the men and women that made the ultimate sacrifice. Mr. Secretary, I do. When you think about it and and to later today I'll be at Arlington and last night was at the concert. When you think about those who gave that ultimate sacrifice, when you think about the families who are home, I remember being when I was in Iraq and I was having to work and we would lose uh folks in the hospital and sending them home. What I was thinking about was the families who were now without. So today on this Memorial Day, not only do we remember those who gave that last full measure of devotion, but remember today as you go about your life that there are some who are still looking at an empty chair. they're looking at a a visit or someone that they would pick up the phone and talk to that they no longer can. It's about those who gave that sacrifice that we remember today because our country is built on the shoulders of those who gave for us. Mr. Secretary, um we don't want their deaths to be in vain. Do you get the impression and and I went out with some of my vet friends last night that we're back that there's this spirit now in the country as we honor these men and women that that it's not in vain anymore? that we got a commander-in-chief of SEC death that is prepared if these enemies decide they're going to attack us. Yeah, we do. I mean, with President Trump, I mean, it goes from the veterans who served when he told me his only instructions to me were, ""Doug, take care of our veterans to every day when he stands up for the world and says, ""Look, you will not be the ones who will push us around. We're not going to be the punching bag of the world. We're going to stand up for what is right. We're not going to intervene where we don't need to be, but we're also going to show strength to the world."" And I think when you couple that with my friend over at Pete at Secretary of Defense, we're putting back that warrior ethos. We're putting back that spirit of our military that has one job and one job only, and that is protect our country and stand for the freedoms that it has. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for joining the program this morning and and giving us an update on what's happening because I tell you, there's a lot of veterans this morning. Um they they may have not paid the ultimate sacrifice, but they came back with a lot of wounds and they need that help and you're getting it for them. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you much. Take care. You too. All right. So, President Trump MVP Vance sending a different kind of message to the next generation of military leaders, saying it's about service, not ideology. But first, back now with a look at some of your headlines. The Karen Reed murder retrial continues tomorrow morning after taking a break from Memorial Day. The defense is getting ready to make its case this week to jurors after over 20 days of testimony. Reed is accused of hitting her then boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, with her car and speeding off. Her attorneys say she is being framed by local and state police. The FBI is now investigating after a flight from Tokyo to Houston was diverted to Seattle Saturday when a passenger tried opening an emergency exit door mid-flight. The suspect had to be restrained until the plane could land. And then on the ground, a second passenger reportedly began punching a bathroom door and was also removed. Although the FBI says no charges have been filed against either passenger at this time. Crazy. And the Knicks giving New Yorkers something to feel good about. Last night taking down the Pacers in game three of the Eastern Conference Finals 106 to 100. After coming back from down 20 points earlier in the game, Indiana now leads the series 2 to1. And game four is tomorrow night in Indianapolis. And those are your headlines. Let's check in with senior meteorologist Janice Dean for our Fox weather forecast. Janice? Yes. Good morning. Let's take a look at it. We have the potential for severe storms including tornadoes. So, a tornado warn storm uh just outside of Tyler, Texas. A couple of them here. So, rotation on Doppler radar indicating a couple of tornadoes in the area. Know what to do if there's a watch or a warning. Uh and that's certainly going to be the case throughout the day today for parts of Texas through Louisiana up towards Arkansas and then tomorrow this stalled frontal boundary and along that the potential for stronger storms including hail, damaging winds, isolated tornadoes, heavy rainfall as well that could cause flash flooding. So over the next few days, some of the same areas getting hit hard by heavy rainfall. Uh these downpours could cause flash flooding for Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, up towards the Mississippi and the Tennessee River Valley. Uh not only today, Tuesday, and Wednesday along the Gulf Coast as well. So here's your forecast again today for Memorial Day. If you have parades, I know my son is going to be uh marching in a Memorial Day parade today. Uh northeast looks good, but the central US really a focus on the severe weather. And again, if you live in Texas, a couple of tornado warned storms have a way to get those watches and warnings. Foxweather.com will give you the latest forecast details. Uh, so the central US really the bullseye for the stronger storms. The West Coast looks good for the most part. Uh, the Northeast also looks good. And there's your forecast highs today. So, oh, going through the next couple of days. The northern and central plains cooler than average across uh the Gulf Coast. That's where the temperatures remain warm. And that's going to kind of be the pattern as we get through the next couple of days, uh, the end of May into early June. Uh, so that's that's significant temperature departures, especially as you look across the south where, uh, you know, I I'm sure that they will enjoy the cooler air after a warm start to the spring. All right, Charlie, we'll send it over to you. Thanks, Janice. Of course, President Trump and Vice President JD Vance both delivering commencement speeches to the next generation of military service members at West Point and the Naval Academy. You've earned your commissions and you stepped forward to serve at a moment when your country needs you now more than ever. Instead of sports teams and spreadsheets and software, you chose a life of service. I could not be more proud to serve you as your commanderin-chief. Retired Navy Seal officer Mike Celli joins us now. Great to see you this morning on this uh hallowed and important day. Happy Memorial Day. Yes. And to you, you know, what does it mean uh to the men and women in uniform when they see speeches like that? Well, having gone to the Naval Academy graduation last year, this is a muchneeded conclusion to the War of Contrasts, a return to American exceptionalism versus uh, you know, social experiments. When when Harrison Biden spoke, they talked about DEI and green initiatives. I'm going to tell you right now, troops don't care if their tanks run on recycled uh, or one to their left and right uh, look like. They care that they obtain the or uphold the standards and they can do their job. So to see Trump and Vance talk about the warrior ethos, a return to duty, discipline, honor, courage, and commitment. I think they reminded these young officers, these leaders, that their job is peace through strength, to defend the nation, not be subject to or or to manage these social experiments. They're willing to die. The only thing that politicians need to remember is don't send them into a stupid war. And you look at the recruitment numbers, they're extra. There's been an explosion with recruitment numbers in the Navy and in the Army. Army has hit their quota, 85% of their quota in April coming into this year. That that's a massive uptick from being short by 25%. This is about leadership. When you want to join an organization, you want to work for great leaders. Why was why were the recruitment numbers down? Because we had an administration that wasn't pro America, that weren't great leaders. Why would you want to join for people that that don't believe in this ideal we call America? This is leadership and that's why we've seen the recruitment come up because people feel that American exceptionalism. So a few people more than you yourself know like have faces in mind when you think of Memorial Day. Um we all do but you have probably more than the rest of us. Um what is your message on Memorial Day? You know this isn't about the start of summer or sales. Uh, this day is about headstones. It's about silence. And I automatically think of the gold star families. You know, they're not concerned about the barbecue. They're concerned about setting an empty plate at the table. They're not going to a retail sale. They're they're they're going to grave sites. And this day is not a long weekend. It's a sacred weekend. It's not about what we get to do. It's about what they will never be able to do. And that with that becomes, you know, comes gratitude. It is a promise. We need a revisit of our our our greatness and what you and I are going to do in our nation collectively to honor their sacrifice. You continue to serve these men and women uh with your Fox Nation series uh The Unsung of Arlington. And I want to play Turn it up. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. What's your mom? This is okay. Okay. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Number six.",0.061,0.792,0.147,1.0
3DcVhDCNi3U,4302,405,22,"Today's Catholic Mass Readings and Gospel Reflection - Monday, May 26, 2025",20250525,"May the peace of the Lord be with you all. As we bring to you the readings of today's Holy Mass. Come, let us now listen to the word of God. May 26th, 2025. Memorial of St. Philip Ner, [Music] Priest. A reading from the Acts of the Apostles. We set sail from Trrowass and took a straight course to Samothrace. The following day to Nepalis and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city for some days. On the Sabbath day, we went outside the gate by the river where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there. A certain woman named Lydia, a worshshiper of God, was listening to us. She was from the city of Thotira and a dealer in purple cloth. The Lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by Paul. When she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, ""If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my home."" And she prevailed upon us. The word of the Lord. Responsorial Psalm. The response is, ""The Lord takes delight in his people. Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise in the assembly of the faithful. Let Israel be glad in its maker. Let the children of Zion rejoice in their king."" The Lord takes delight in his people. Let them praise his name with dancing, making melody to him with tambourine and liar. For the Lord takes pleasure in his people. He adorns the humble with victory. The Lord takes delight in his people. Let the faithful exalt in glory. Let them sing for joy on their couches. Let the high praises of God be in their throats. This is glory for all his faithful ones. Praise the Lord. The Lord takes delight in his people. The Spirit of truth will testify on my behalf, says the Lord, and you also will testify. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to John. Jesus said to his disciples, ""When the advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf. You also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning. I have said these things to you to keep you from stumbling. They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, an hour is coming when those who kill you will think that by doing so they are offering worship to God. And they will do this because they have not known the Father or me. But I have said these things to you so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you about them. The Gospel of the Lord. Gospel reflection. Jesus informs his disciples that the spirit of truth will come and that the spirit as well as the disciples will testify to him. When Jesus first spoke these words to his disciples, they would not have comprehended what he meant. Since these words are prophetic in nature, they are words spoken that were to come to fulfillment and then once fulfilled, the words would be understood. So what does Jesus mean? When we look at the acts of the apostles and read about the early church, it is clear that something incredibly transforming took place after Jesus ascended into heaven. Up until that time, the disciples and other followers of Jesus had faith, but they were also fearful. They communicated with those others who believed, but did so in secret and with fear. But as soon as Pentecost came and the Holy Spirit, the advocate, the Spirit of truth, descended upon them, the apostles began to be used by God to powerfully proclaim the gospel without fear and with great effect upon many. It was this experience of the disciples of our Lord being filled with the Holy Spirit to which Jesus was referring after Jesus died and perhaps even more so after Jesus ascended into heaven. It is likely that some of his disciples immediately concluded that the new movement Jesus started was now over. They could have never conceived of the idea that what Jesus started was only beginning. They could have never conceived of the fact that soon they would share in the beginning of the church, proclaim the gospel with courage and power, see the conversion of countless lives, witness the ongoing forgiveness of sins, and ultimately give their lives in imitation of our Lord. These disciples had no idea just what awaited them with the coming of the advocate, the spirit of truth. What was awaiting them was their sharing in the ability to testify to Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit. They soon realized that Jesus was actually more alive than ever and that he was now going forth to convert souls by the power of the Holy Spirit and through the instrumentality of all of his new disciples. The same is true in our lives today. It is far too common for Christians to simply believe in Jesus personally, but then fail to wholeheartedly give testimony to him by the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. It is far too common for followers of Christ to act more like the disciples prior to the coming of the Holy Spirit. Too often, Christians keep the gospel to themselves, fearful of giving testimony by the power of the Holy Spirit. Reflect today upon these prophetic words of Jesus. Though these words were initially spoken to the 12, Jesus also speaks these words to you today. He wants you too to be a witness to him, giving testimony to others so that they will come to believe. Reflect upon how well you fulfill this prophetic calling. Where you are lacking, pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in your life so that God can reach many hearts through you. Let us pray. Most glorious Jesus, you promise to send upon your disciples and also upon me the Holy Spirit, the advocate and spirit of truth. Holy Spirit, I welcome you into my life and offer myself to you without reserve to be used to give testimony to the truth. Please do use me, my God, and touch many lives through me. Jesus, I trust in you. Amen. Thank you for watching. Please like, subscribe, and share it with your friends and family so that they may also be blessed as you are.

ScpoQVvK0Mw,1346,44,9,2025 Hyundai Santa Fe XRT Review: Off-Road and On-Road | Drive.com.au,20250526,"it's a hybrid it's a 7 seater it's an SUV and it's even got boxy styling this Hyundai Santa Fe gives Australian buyers a lot of those things that we seem to really want but now with the xrt pack we've also got an off-roader now that's another thing that people love as well but is it any good does it actually work off-road and does it compromise what this Santa Fe is let's go for a drive [Music] there's a few exterior details like this Stone shield on the front you've also got some windshields down the side there but the main thing about this xrt pack is no doubt the wheel and tire package so you've got pelli Scorpion allterrain tires they are clearly a much better off-road tire in terms of grip but they're also mounted onto a 17in wheel so instead of something like an 18in or a 20-in wheel that you often see on SUVs like this you've got more Tire tohe ratio effectively and that is better for off-roading you can air down better this thing will be a lot more durable for going on rough tracks and that sort of thing now behind this wheel we've also got some different suspension components for the xrt pack different dampers as well so we'll see what this thing is like to drive onroad and off-road but you've got effectively a 30 mil lift in terms of clearance but as you can see it's still not a massive lifted vehicle you've got side steps there do you really need them maybe not to get in and out this isn't exactly a massive rig off-road but in terms of storage you do get a roof rack with this xrt which is good news this is a big SUV but if you're going to go off-road and camping that sort of thing let me tell you storage space is very important so things like swags and Tents can go up on top here and save a lot of space on the inside but speaking of the inside let's see what this Santa Fe is like being a top speec calligraphy model this Santa Fe has plenty of standard equipment there's heated and vented front seat with electric adjustment and Driver position memory a digital rear viiew mirror and a head-up display seats also get an upgraded Nappa leather trim and there's even a trick UVC sterilization feature in one of those glove boxes priced at $75,000 plus onroad costs the xrt peak pack throws another $9,990 on top so you've got a fairly Hefty asking price here of just under 85 Grand before onroad costs now what does that xrt pack include you've got different wheels and off-road tires a roof rack side steps underbody protection and there's a stone shield on the Bonnet along with wind deflectors on the doors we've got Hybrid Power in this Santa which combines a 1.6 L turbocharged petrol engine with a six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive now there is a transmission mounted electric motor and combined total outputs of 72 KW and 367 NM claimed fuel economy for a Santa Fe hybrid is a very misly 5.6 L per 100K but it's worth pointing out that the addition of allterrain tires and a roof rack would knock this economy around a little bit there's a lot to like about the interior of this Santa Fe firstly from a looks and Aesthetics point of view o and this interior looks fantastic now we are in the calligraphy spec effectively so this is top spec you are paying for a lot of the nice materials and finishes that we have here but I have to say it does look you got this wood grain looking trim here you've got nice Leathers different colors around the place but beyond that you've also got some really good storage as well so over in front of the passenger here you got a little glove box hidden in there another little shelf hidden below this other glove box so that's really good for storage and then in the middle here you've got two wireless charging pads which just also doubles as storage really if you're not going to put phones in here you can just put other bits and Bobs two cup holders here a pretty big center console that's got another trick which I'll show you a little bit later and then we've got storage underneath in this floating console as well so in terms of fitting all your bits and your Bobs in this is really well set up on that side of things in terms of infotainment we've got one big long curving display here so that's got your infotainment and a digital cluster in front this is a good setup here we've had a good run with Hyundai's latest operating system here you've got Apple carplay Android auto Digital radio navigation all of those things that you would expect you've also got connected services so you can do things on your phone connect it to your car all of that sort of thing and then further down here you've got all of your air conditioning controls so a good range of buttons you've got a volume dial you've got climate control dials it all falls to hand quite easily it's not buried within the infotainment display which I do like and of course the seats These are nice and comfort there's plenty of adjustment here we've got Heating and venting in this spec as well this looks and feels like quite a premium offering overall which is important because this isn't a cheap vehicle especially when you add on that $10,000 xrt pack like we have here but beside the price I think this does wow in the important elements here's the second row of the Santa Fe and first things first let's talk about space now that's my driving position up front there I'm around 1.8 m tall and as you can see I've got loads of leg room on offer that's really good head room is good also even though we do have a sun roof here now this seat is actually adjustable as well which is important so we do have sliding ability and we've also got the ability to tilt a little bit further back if you want to get comfortable on those long trips or you want to sit up for a bit more posture whatever it might be this second row does work really well for space and also flexibility now we've got cup holders in the doors here we've got a bit of a storage lot here where the door handle is and a sun shade for when you want to have a little bit of a nap during the day and there's no air vents here as you'll notice in that regular spot because they are over here in the B pillar so that all works well why are there no air vents here because you've actually got some pretty Handy Storage so this center console like I showed you before also opens from the rear so I can get into stuff there but also there's another little slot lower down here and that's actually all connected so I can put stuff in here I can Gra it from the front it's a really handy thing and sometimes those in the back only really have cup holders for storage so if you've got kids with devices and toys and snacks and whatnot on that long road trip this could really come in handy because they've got a spot to put all of their bits and Bobs and of course we've got pop down armrest in the middle here with two cup holders a hard back seat which I think is Handy a little bit of storage there and then two USBC power outlets in the back of the seats so this does does work well from a visibility point of view from a comfort point of view also from a practicality point of view all right I'm in the third row of this Santa Fe now and for reference I've moved this seat forward a little bit I've slid it forward so my legs definitely aren't touching that driver's seat in front but it's given me a little bit more space here and well my knees are touching a little bit on the front of the seat here uh it's it's not too bad I've got to say for a third row it's okay I'm not hugely spacious this isn't as good as something like a k Carnival or a big larger SUV like a Hyundai Palisade for example but it's not too bad I think kids would be quite happy in here and adults on short trips no worries now we do get cup holders here we do get air vents with air conditioning controls and a USB point so you're not missing out on features like that and visibility well it's not too bad either we are sitting down a little bit in comparison to this higher up second row I think but it's not too bad and another thing to note here actually is the fact that we get two sets of iso fix points in the back here so you've got good flexibility in terms of where you want to fit your child seats we've got two sets of iso fix up front as well there's five top tether points so you can really adjust things as to where you need it in terms of what you need on the move but one other thing I want to talk to you about is the amount of boot space that we've got when we are set up like this so let's go and have a look so while this boot opens another thing to point out about this Center pH is that you do get a fulls size there underneath that's a proper parelli scorpion alterrain which is good to see now in terms of boot space as a seven seater no it's not massive but at the same time it's not too bad you can fit a few school bags in the back here and that sort of thing but I don't know if you're going to be going away as a family of six or seven on the road unless of course you make amazing use of that roof rack up top but pop these down into five- seat mode and you've actually got a good amount of space here on offer you can slide that second row back to stop things falling down but I do really like this hearty material in the back here instead of having carpet because I know from experience when you go camping or you're going to the beach or something like that it's really hard to clean a car up afterwards if you're vacuuming the carpet for what seems like hours this is much more durable and also much easier to clean so that's good to see [Music] everything you know and love about the regular Santa Fe hybrid carries over with this xrt model the modifications done to it doesn't really disrupt what makes this a fantastic choice as a family car around town it's really well dialed in terms of good ride quality good refinement good bump absorption and all of that sort of thing now these tires they're a bit more aggressive but in saying that they're not too bad you might get a bit more noise on the highway and you'll probably get higher fuel consumption but this being a well sorted hybrid system we we're seeing around 8 L per 100ks overall so still it's quite Frugal considering the size of the car and the amount of gear you've got and all of that sort of thing and this hybrid system is a good one this is an area where Toyota has had such dominance for a long time but I've got to say Hyundai have really caught up with this model it's got a good amount ount of electric power so it does Coast quite often it does turn this engine off as often as it can to save fuel but importantly when it kicks in it does it in a way that you don't really notice from behind the wheel so it's a smooth Driving Experience that's clean that's quiet there's really not much to dislike about this car the way it behaves on road it is really quite good but we do of course have a bit of off-road capability baked into this xrt model and if you're going to be buying it I hope you're not just buying it for the looks I hope you're actually buying this vehicle because you maybe want to do a little bit of adventuring off the road so let's go and see how it performs in that kind of situation 7even seat SUVs are all the rage at the moment and if you are in the market for one don't forget to check out drive Marketplace to see what is on [Music] offer all right we're Offroad in this Santa Fe and it's worth pointing out straight off the bat that you shouldn't expect this car to be a real competitor to something like a Toyota Lan Cruiser pra or a Ford Everest just just not built the same as a vehicle I I say it for a few reasons firstly the clearance isn't there in the same way the Chazzy and suspension setup is noticeably different and that does make a difference off-road but also the drive system this is an all-wheel drive and it's not a four-wheel drive and that's a very important distinction to make because one is not the same as the other but in saying that I've been pleasantly surprised I think by this Santa Fe it does feel pretty good off-road and to be honest this will probably give you enough capability or more capability than you probably need for the kind of adventuring that you want to do no it's not going to take on the Simpson desert it might be a bit out of place up in Cape York but for fire Trails a couple of Muddy bogs that sort of thing a little bit of cross axle stuff it's not too bad but in this testing that I've done I've driven this into a couple of off camber setups where the car starts to lift a wheel and if you choose the right driving mode here so if you press this button here and go down into terrain you can pick snow and then if you go into mud that's probably the most aggressive mode it's it's not too bad a lot of wheel spin um and the car isn't particularly dignified in the way it goes about getting over obstacles but it can do it so choose your challenges judiciously I think in this car don't expect it to be crazy but it's actually not too bad the ride quality on roads like this is pretty good it's got decent bump absorption capabilities here you do need to slow down a little bit for holes and ruts because we don't have long travel suspension here or anything like that and because we do have a shortage of ground clearance you're just not going to be able to take on regular off-road tracks that you would with other four-wheel drive so as long as you keep coloring in between the lines so to speak with this car choose that terrain button go into the mud mode because that keeps the engine running a little bit more instead of just being in pure hybrid you've got four driven Wheels it's actually pretty good and of course because you've got these allterrain tires you've got a lot more traction there there and you've got a bit more scope to air those tires down if you want to go driving on a bit of sand maybe not Ultra Soft hot and dry sand but a bit of sand a bit of mud wet grass and that sort of thing this is much better set up than a regular SUV but it doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water in terms of onroad characteristics refinement packaging and all those sorts of things so this definitely has a nice little niche I think where it plays quite well [Music] now you don't need the most tough and rugged off-roader to get out into the bush and enjoy a couple of Australia's more quieter sides even though that's an idea that we all kind of love in our head now this Santa Fe no it's not an extreme off-roader but it is an improvement over what you normally get in Hyundai's large 7 seat SUV but the beauty of this car is that it doesn't throw away what makes this car great great otherwise so you've got decent off-road ability you've got good tires you've got a bit of Peace of Mind with something like a fulls sizee spare tire but you've also got something that is well composed refined practical and spacious for the weekly usage as a family car so this won't suit everyone it's almost a bit of a niche offering I think and unfortunately the price does start to really get up there when you add on calligraphy on top of the xrt pack but this could be the perfect fit for a lot of amilies who want to go add into the bush but not go completely crazy now if you're watching this video on YouTube make sure you give us a thumbs up and you'll subscribe to our Channel and of course if you want to see the full story on this Santa Fe calligraphy xrt or any other new car on the Australian car market head over to drive.com.au now it's not a hybrid like the Santa Fe it's actually diesel powered but if you want a more serious four-wheel drive for family usage I reckon you should check out this video here this is

[Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat up [Music] here. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Good morning everybody. Good morning. Welcome to our worship service this morning. It is an honor to have you with us and we're just uh pleased the Lord has brought you to this place at least online and I want to give a big big welcome to each and every one of you. Thank you for being present. I know this is a Memorial Day weekend. So we are just celebrating and rejoicing for a wonderful holiday. I pray that you'll have a great Memorial Day weekend and that you're adding worship into your time together with this weekend. I want to read to you what the word of the Lord says and it's found in Psalm 98. Here's what it says. Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth. Make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise. Sing unto the Lord with the harp and with the voice of a psalm. We sing unto the Lord today. We are honoring and worshiping God today. We thank him for his goodness, his grace, and his mercy and his presence in our life. I'm so glad you're here. I want to encourage you to please get active in the worship this morning. There's a chat space that's right on your screen. And if you're watching this on YouTube or on your television or so, if you would grab your smartphone or grab your smart device and use the chat space and chat with us this morning, let us know who you are and where you're worshiping and watching from, especially if you're not from the city of Atlanta. We'd love to know that. And if this is your first time, we'd love to get a chance to know that as well, so we can greet you properly. We are absolutely honored and overjoyed that you're with us, that you're here to worship. You're a part of our family. At the end of worship today, you're going to have an opportunity to be a part of our family officially. There's going to be an opportunity for you to actually join our church from anywhere you are in the world. We've designed ministry to minister to you even though you don't live here in the city. Also, you have an opportunity at the end of worship to accept Jesus as your savior if you're not born again. I'm praying today that you will come to know him as Lord and Savior. That you will surrender your life to him. I pray that you will grow from the word of God. We're going to be teaching on love and it's a powerful topic and a powerful message. You do not want to miss it. We're talking about love refuses to be toxic and it's going to be an amazing experience for you. I'm praying that you are a part of today's worship where we're going to be worshiping God, celebrating him, singing his praises today. Come on, join us. Join with us. We're truly going to make a joyful noise unto the Lord. We have special events happening today along with our baby dedications. It's going to be wonderful. Would you pray with me? Father, I love you and I thank you for who you are. I thank you for your goodness, your kindness, your grace, your mercy in our life. Lord, you are a faithful God. I pray now that you would be with us in worship. That you'd anoint our service, every song, every hymn, every prayer, the preached word, the fellowship of saints. I pray that every aspect of worship is anointed with great glory and great grace. We pray that you would be in the room, in the living rooms, bedrooms, workspaces, wherever we're at today, that you will meet us there. We lift up our hallelujah unto you. We celebrate and give you glory. We pray now that you receive our worship in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen again. All right. Don't go anywhere. Get your heart together. Get your soul together. Get your thoughts together. Come on, let's worship the Lord today. This is the day he's made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. I'll see you in worship. [Music] [Music] Oh my [Music] god. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] It has been a week of trials and troubles, ups and downs. It has been a week. So please hear my heart when I say I was glad when they said unto me. Let us go into the house of the Lord. You know at the end of service sometimes pastor says God bless you and God keep you and make his face to shine upon you. And this next line, man, I felt that so much this week. And grant you his peace. Come what may grant you his peace. Y'all, it's easy to trust in God until it's time to trust in God. But I pray the Lord would grant you his peace. When Paul was in prison the first time, he wrote a letter to the church at Colass and he said, ""For it pleased the Lord that in him that in Christ all fullness dwells."" All fullness. That's that's the thing that holds it and the thing that fills it up. All fullness dwells in him. And he said, ""And having made peace with his blood on his cross,"" it doesn't say the cross, it says his cross, ""Having made peace, having manufactured peace, having wrought and created peace right there on the cross."" He said, ""By himself, reconciling everything to himself."" Yes, sir. reconciling everything to himself. [Music] Real quick, there used to be a Kroger down here on the corner that I would go to in my single broke days and I would walk into this Kroger right here on Can Road and I'd have this big old bucket of coins with pennies and nickels and dimes cuz it was all that I had left. And they had this machine in there where in the front of the store if you take and dump all your quarters and nickels and dimes in there, it would reconcile them. It would reconcile them and give you a value. It would put the quarters where the quarters go and the dimes where the dimes go and the pennies where the pennies go. It would reconcile them. But while it was happening, that machine was loud. It was chaotic. It was a mess. When God went to the cross to make his peace, he was reconciling you and me to [Music] himself. And then during that reconciling, it might be a mess, but I'm telling you, it's easy to trust God until it's time to trust God. I'm asking you to trust God today. Yes, sir. So, as we go into worship, I need you to open up your whole heart and let go of those coins. Let go of those quarters, nickels, and dimes. Let go of those troubles. Let go of that health report. Let go of that relationship. Let go of that family member. I need you to let that go right now. Just let it go because he paid it all on the cross and pleased the father that all the fullness dwelt in him. That's the God that we're inviting to service today. So as we go deeper into worship, bring your whole heart. Bring your whole heart. Dear gracious Lord, we say thank you, Father, for your blessing and your keeping. We say thank you for blessing us and granting us your peace in the midst of whatever storm we're in. Father God, we'll draw closer to you today. Father God, we'll give you all the praise and all the glory and all the honor. Come what may, Lord, your will be done. yours, not ours. Your way, nothing more, nothing less in Jesus' name. And every believer said, ""Amen."" Amen. Somebody raise your voice and give God praise in this place. Come on, give him praise in this [Music] place. Scott said something amazing. He said there was an exchange that happened. And today we're exchanging our spirit of heaviness for a garment of praise. So would you lay down those burdens and lift up your hands and open your mouth and give God what he deserves. It has nothing to do with you and everything to do with him. Father, we give you the glory. We give you the honor. We give you the praise that you deserve. For you are holy. For you are righteous. For you are wonderful. For you are kind. For you are beautiful. For you are gracious. For you are consistent. For you are faithful. And you are worthy of our praise. Hallelujah. We give you praise. We give you praise. We give you praise. We give you praise. We give you praise. We give you praise. We pour out our best for you. Let's go. We came to give God our best this morning. Amen. Come on, clap your [Music] hands. Oh, you were Jesus. Yeah. [Music] We will sing and rejoice as one people, lifting one voice. You're worthy of the glory, worthy of the honor, worthy of the praise. And we will shout and proclaim of the greatness, your holy name. You're worthy of glory, worthy of honor, worthy of praise. So we sing you are holy. You are holy. The whole earth sings your praise.

We pour out our best for you. We pour out our best for you. [Music] We pour out our best for you. We break open our alabaster bombs. We pour out our best for you. [Music] Have you poured out your best for him? I want you to close your eyes for me for just a second. And I'd like for you to imagine you standing there facing that thing, that thing that you're dealing with. Just close your eyes for me for a second and imagine that you're standing there facing that trial or you're facing that challenge or that hill or that obstacle. Can you see it? Can you see it? Now, scripture says that he inhabits the praises of his people. So, as you imagine yourself standing there facing that thing, I want you in your imagination to look down next to you at that space standing next to you and picture God standing right there with you facing that thing. [Music] If he inhabits the praises of his people, then make a place for him to stand today. In that picture in your mind, I need you to pour out your best for him. I need you to clap like you've never clapped before. I need you to holler like you've never hollered before. I need you to stomp around and move around like you've never done before. You inhabit the praises of your people, oh God. Listen to your people, God. They need you right now. Come right now, oh God. In the sanctuary, oh God, come right now. Come right now, oh God. On the on the screen, Lord God, come right now into the airwaves, in the living rooms, Lord. Come right now across devices, across the speakers. Come right now, Lord God. Father God, we need you right now. We need your presence, Lord God. We need to feel close to you, Lord God. Father God, we pour out our best for you because that's what you did for us. Father God, we want to be close to you. So as the trials come, Lord God, we're not running around looking for you. You're right there holding our hand. We stay close to you. Father God, we pour out our best for you in faith and expectation that you will and you have done the same for us. Father God, we thank you for joining us in this worship experience today. Father God, you are completely invited here. Not only invited, Lord, but welcome. You're welcome here in every heart and every mind. Lord God, I welcome you to have a seat right down in tabernacle with us. Lord God, even for the person whose expression of worship is totally silent today, Father God, sit closest to them. Lord God, for those who are untangling mess in their mind and trying to see a way forward, Lord God, I'm asking you to be close to them. Father God, I'm asking that you would let the Holy Spirit do the work of saving in this place today. You know what we need. You make intercession for us. And we're thankful for that. So, Father God, have your way. Like only you can. We know that where you give the vision, you'll give the provision. We know that you see differently, hear differently, and think differently than us. So, we're just going to trust you. We're just going to trust you, Lord God. Have your way in this place in Jesus name. And every believer said amen. Said amen. Say amen again like you mentioned. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You may have your seats. I want to say thank you for uh joining us in this new life worship experience both here and online.

So, as we get ready to go deeper in the service, please give your attention to our pastor, Pastor Marlon [Music] Harris. Let's give God praise this morning. What a wonderful day it is. A great day to be in the house of the Lord, isn't it? Praise God. Praise God. We have some families that are dedicating their babies to the Lord today. And I am absolutely overjoyed to have these families dedicating their children to God. And um I'm going to ask if we could have uh these families come up on the stage with the parents of Zachary Haney, Mia Haney. Please bring Zachary to the altar. Amen. And our next would the Ashley Stevens please bang Amaya Stevens to the altar and would DeAndre and Amanda Moore please bring Asa Deandre Moore to the altar. Let's receive all of these as they come. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Let's give them another big hand as they are [Applause] [Music] coming. Come right on down and stand right here. [Applause] How are you all doing? Good. Let me know who I have here. This Stevens, the father Stevens. Ashley. Ashlin. And your first name? Dier. Dier. I know I said that wrong. I know I said that wrong. D and Ashley. Nice to meet both of you. And your name? My name is Daniel. I'm actually a godmother. The mom is somewhere around. Okay. This is Zachary. This is Zachary. All right. Great. Good to meet you. Good to meet you. All right. Well, I need to talk to uh parents if I could for just a moment. I just want you to know that we don't dedicate just children. We dedicate families because we believe that the family is who God is holding accountable for the raising, the development, the growth of the child. That God holds that family accountable. And what I've learned is that you cannot demonstrate or you cannot teach rather what you're not demonstrating. If you're not living it, the child is only going to learn what they see. They're not going to listen as much to what they hear. I um was remembering of a story that was told to me that was actually just recently about how this man had seen his son drift away from God. And this young boy in his teenage years, 16 years old or so, he just drifted from the faith, drifted from God, went through high school years, and then he went to college and spent time doing everything he shouldn't do, just things he shouldn't do. It caused his family so much stress, so much pain to see their son just drifting completely away. They did all the praying they could, all of the fasting, believing, and trusting God, and the boy kept drifting away. Then all of a sudden one day in his mid20s came back to God. He just came back to God. They they couldn't understand what happened. And so the father sat him down and said, ""Son, what what brought you back? Glad you're back, but what brought you back?"" And here's what the boy said. He said, ""Dad, I looked at the way you and mom loved Jesus, and I knew I couldn't stay where I was."" He said, ""Your life brought me back. Your life, this mother's life, your life is what's going to hold this baby. And if the baby ever strays, and we do, it's your life that brings them back. Live it in front of them."" So, can I pray for you? Yes. All right. Is the mom here? Still. Mom, come on up. I need you up here. Did you hear everything I just said? She said, ""No."" All right. I'll minister it to you afterwards. Okay. Can I pray for you? Can I pray for you? Father, I lay my hands upon this dad. I pray for strength in this man. I pray for glory to rest upon him. That you make him more than a provider. Make him a priest and a prophet of his home. I pray that when you speak to this family, that this man's ears are open to hear your voice and that his family knows that you've spoken. when he speaks. I pray for vision. I pray for insight. I pray for glory and anointing on him as a dad and as a man. Jesus name. I pray for this mom. I pray that you would give her a meek and a quiet spirit. I pray that you would allow yourself to be more and more real to her. That she would bend her knees to you. That you would fill her heart and her life with wisdom. God that you would fill her with your spirit, that she would speak your words to her home, that she would be a nurturer and a nourisher of those things that the spirit of God places in her heart. I pray that her heart would be tender to the voice of the Lord. And that God, that you would be able, that you would have an audience with her, that you would be able to speak to her, that her ears would not be stopped, but that she would be open. I pray that you'd make her a virtuous woman. I pray that you would give her the qualities of the spirit in Jesus' name and I give you praise for it. I pray for this mom. I pray God that you would teach her your ways, that you would minister to her your truth, that she would be a role model for her son. I pray that you would speak to her family, to her heart, to her household. And Lord, when you want to say something to this home, I pray that there's ears and a heart that's open to hear you. I pray for obedience from her, for submission from her. I pray for meekness from her. I pray God that you would give her a meek and a quiet spirit. I pray that she would have the wisdom of the Holy Ghost upon her. That you would fill her with your grace. I pray that nothing is ever missing or broken in this home in Jesus' name. In Jesus' name and I give you praise in the name of Jesus. Amen. [Applause] Amen. Mia, would you step forward with Zachary? Step forward. You hold him and I pray for your son. Father, I anoint this young man. I pray that he would be a man of God. That you would speak your peace to his heart. I pray that he would know your will for his life. I pray that nothing in his life is ever missing or out of place. I pray that you will fill every gap, that you'll close every hole. I pray that his hands would follow you, that his feet would walk in your path, that his knees would bend to you, that he would be a husband and a father, that God, you would teach him your ways. I pray that he would know you in every area of his life. Anoint this young man that he may be your man in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen again. I present to the church brother Zachary Haney. Would you give this young man a strong [Music] hand? [Music] Would you please bring little Amaya Stevens to the altar? I, Amaya, can I pray for you? Amaya, I lay my hands upon you, but it is the Lord that touches your life. I pray that your heart would be full of him. I pray that your soul would live for him. That your mind would think his thoughts, that your ear would hear his voice. I pray for your feet that they only walk in the path that he has destined for you. I pray that your hands would seek to do his will. And I pray that everything about your life fulfills his perfect plan for your life. Nothing in your life is missing. Nothing in your life is out of place. You are God's daughter. May you grow to be God's woman, a wife and a mother. And may you be a leader. May those look to you when they need to find Jesus. May you represent him in everything you do. In Jesus' name, amen and amen again. I present to the church Amaya Stevens. Come on and give her a big big big hand. [Applause] Would you give these two families a really really big big hand? Bless you both. Bless you. Bless you. You may return to your seats. Oh, you can do better than that. Come on as a church family. Let's partner with them. Let's partner with them and make up our mind and we're going to help them raise these kids. [Music] Hallelujah. God is so good, isn't he? We serve a great God. We serve a wonderful God. Well, it's good to see you this morning. All right. You're the ones who didn't go out of town for Memorial Day. Amen. It is Memorial Day weekend. I can see it. I can see it. Well, that's okay. We've already welcomed all of those that are joining online today. And I want us to do it again because I know we have a lot of folks that are in different parts of the state and and country uh joining us today. I just want to tell y'all put down them ribs and put down that that uh that barbecue grill and come on in here and let's get some church in. Amen. Let's welcome all of our online hosting guests once more. I know you've already done it. Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. Well, I got a couple things I want to make certain that we know about uh in terms of announcements today. First of all, that we are getting ready to uh break ground on our 3.89 acres to build 32 homes. 32 homes. Amen. We're getting ready to do that. Before we do, we have to petition with to our county to reszone that property. It's currently zoned as commercial. We're going to zone it as residential and we need to have a community meeting to do that so that the community can come together and share their thoughts, their input, their feedback in that process. And we wanted to make certain that our entire community was here, not only to hear about uh this first project, which is 32 homes, but to hear about our larger project that we believe God's calling us to do in order to transform and change this community and this society. This is our way of defending our bean field. Amen. And so we're going to have a special community meeting. It's going to be on June the 3, June the 3rd, where we're going to share, of course, our plans for our first project, 32 homes. And then we'll share our plans for our larger project and make certain that businesses, residents, neighbors, friends, guests, anyone within a fivemile radius of this facility is able to hear what we're doing and participate and be a part of it. How many of you all agree that you can't change the community without the community's voice in that change? That we need the community's voice. We need to make certain that they're not only at the table, but that they're included and involved and their voice and their thoughts matter in this process. A lot of folks um you know don't a lot of folks understand this is a little different for a church to be doing. But I could not be more serious about wanting to see this community changed radically for the cause of Christ and seeing to it that we have revitalization in this community that does not displace people who already live here. We're not just providing homes. We provide a host of services. Everything from helping with job search to education to GED, getting folks together with substance abuse or domestic violence. The list goes on and on. We are here to be a resource for our community because we believe, listen carefully, we believe that if Jesus were alive on the earth today, he wouldn't be coming to our churches sitting in the back and clapping his hands and saying amen to the preacher. He would be in the street ministering to the practical needs, the everyday needs of people. And so God's blessed us and we should be a blessing to others. And that is our intent and desire. So if you want to hear more about how we're going to transition this community and revitalize it, then I'm asking you to come on June the 3 meeting. It's going to be in the evening at 6:30. And I pray that you will be present and all God's people said, ""Amen."" If you're coming, you do need to register. And there's a QR code and all of that. You go to our website, you'll be able to find it and get registered. Amen. And amen. All right. Well, we had a great Mother's Day, didn't we? It was beautiful. And we are getting ready now for Father's Day. Father's Day. Uh-uh. Y'all need to give it up for dads. Come on. Come on. All right. We're going to have amazing Father's Day here at our church and we're going to have a special Father's Day choir. Our men are going to be singing. Amen. Amen. The men are going to be singing in the choir. And if you are a man and you have no clue how to hold a note, we can't teach you how to hold that, but we can teach you how to sit up here and look real great whenever you're singing. So, um, we encourage and invite you to be a part of our Father's Day choir. It's going to be all men leading in worship that day. We're going to have our rehearsal on this coming Tuesday. So, we are encouraging for all of the men of our church to please register for the choir, be at rehearsal on this Tuesday so you can be a part of that experience. I need some bass and baritone amens. I need some more bass and baritone amens. All right, ladies. Can you say amen just to fill in the empty spaces? Okay. All right. All right. Love you guys. Thank you so much. I want to mention lastly that there is a housing expo that we're going to be hosting here at our church. It is for firsttime home own for homeowners period. If you're a first-time homeowner, if you are have never owned a home before or if you currently own a home and you've been owning your home for a while. We're going to talk about all things home ownership. Everything from how to uh get approved for a loan. How do you go through that process completely? um how do you locate property for you to purchase for you and your family. We're going to talk about what it takes to refinance a property if that is needed and when you should not uh do that. We're going to look at all of the details specifics in terms of owning a home and how do you become a home owner? We know that home ownership is the front door to middle middle class experiences of life. Home ownership is the front door. It gives you an asset. It gives you an asset that creates equity for you financially. And there are so many of our people that don't have either assets or equity and don't know how to get in to the ability into that ability of having residual income or having the ability to have financial uh security, I should say. I'm sorry. And so, I want to encourage you to be a part of this housing expo. It's going to happen on June the 7th. on June the 7th starting at 9:00 a.m. in the morning until 300 p.m. June the 7th, which is a Saturday. Want you to please register. So, there should be a flyer on your screen or one on our website. You can please take notice of that. Let's give God thanks and praise for our announcements for all that's going on at our church. Amen. Well, I want to call you to our time of giving this morning and remind you of the responsibility that we have to honor God with our gifts. A lot of people say a lot of things about tithing. And I just want to tell you what we teach here at our church. We do not teach or believe that tithing is indicative or determines your salvation. That you are saved by the blood of Jesus Christ and that alone. We do not believe or teach that if you tithe, you're going to heaven, and if you don't tithe, you're not going to heaven. Neither of that is true. You go to heaven by the finished work of the cross of Jesus. Period. What we do believe is that tithing is not about heaven. It's about earth. It's not about what happens when you die. Tithing is about what happens before you die. It's the quality of life that you live here. It is honoring God with your treasure. Jesus said that where your treasure is, that's where your heart is at, that your treasure and your heart are in the same place. And if your heart is with God, your treasure should be with him. Our treasure with God does not mean that we give everything we have. If the Lord leads you to do that, that's a different thing. But let's talk before you do something like that. It's not everything you have. It's not even most of what you have. But it is to give God the tenth, the tithe, the first fruit of that which comes into your home and to your family. It is to honor God with your substance. And when you honor God with your substance, this is your livelihood. When you honor him, he honors you. In our day, there it's a financial substance. But in the biblical times, it was the substance of their harvest, their crops, their harvest. And they would bring the first fruit of that. They bring the first fruit of their stall, their uh cattle and their animal. They bring the first fruit of that to the Lord. And the idea is that whatever happens in the first fruit determines the success, the blessing and the quality of the rest of the fruit. And I want to encourage you that as you give today, you are protecting the 90% by bringing God the 10%. And so I pray that you'll honor the Lord in your giving. And then the practical side of giving is that you know when you give here you know where your gifts go. You see the act you see the actions of ministry. You see how it is blessing people. You see how it is making certain that people that are homeless are sheltered and hungry are fed and naked are clothed. And those that are without they are given and they're blessed. And you see that every day. And so as you give you give with confidence spiritually and practically. I pray that you'll give. Father, I thank you for the privilege we have to sew these seeds in your kingdom. I thank you that you've called us to be a blessing to others. That Lord, as we give today, we give out of the bounty you've given to us. And you've blessed every single one of us beyond measure, more than we could have ever imagined. Let us be good stewards of those blessings by putting you first. And so, Father, we bring the tenth, the tithe. We bring the first fruits to you now. Receive them in Jesus name. Amen. Before our ushers come, I want to tell you that there are a few ways you can give. If you're in the room, you can give online uh by going to our website. You also can give uh by text by taking out your smartphones and texting the word um new lifeatl, no spaces, to the number 77977. It allows you to give through our um our electronic portal. And of course, you can give using the envelopes that's in the seatback covers in front of you. You're welcome to utilize those envelopes to give your gifts uh in the buckets that'll be passed. If you're at home, you're able to give in those ways as well. And you also can mail in your gifts to the address on the bottom of your screen. Let's take a quick minute and um let's give together as a family. Take out your tithes, your offerings, your smartphones, and let's give together. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] All my people said, ""Amen. Amen. And amen again. All right. Are you ready for the word of the Lord this morning? So today we're going to be jumping back into our series on love. And um I'm praying that you are here with an open heart. It's going to be a little tough to hear some of the things we're going to be saying today. And I know that everybody approaches uh the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 13 not always as one who is on the side of the violator, but many of us have come to that text on the side of the victim. And I want us to spend some time talking to your spirit and your hearts today. We're going to be talking about toxic love. And it is something that I need for you to bring all of your heart to as we hear what God has to say about this uh this concern. Father, I thank you for your word. I pray for your grace as your word is preached in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. There's an old hymn that says, ""Even me, Lord, even me. Let some drops now fall on me. Anybody need some drops to fall on you? Anybody need some drops to fall on your family? Anybody need some drops to fall on your children? Anybody need some drops to fall on your finances? Anybody need some drops to fall on your community? Father, even me, Lord, I hear of showers of blessings that you are scattering full and free, even me. [Music] [Music] Oh. Lord, I [Music] hear the bless. [Music] Thou art set free [Music] [Applause] [Music] thirsty soul tree. [Music] Let some clouds now fall [Music] on Lord [Music] My shout of [Music] blessing now.

Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Even me, Lord. Even me, Lord. Even me, Lord. Let your drops fall. Let your spirit fall. Let your power fall. Let your anointing fall. Let it fall on me. Let it fall on me. We're open. We're ready. We're available. Let it roll on me. They even meat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Let them fall on me. Let them fall on me. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] How many love to drops to fall on you. How many want some of the blessings of God to fall upon you? Anybody need him to let it fall on you? Come on and lift your voice. Make that declaration that I need the voice. I need the I need the blessing. I need the blessings of God to fall upon us. [Music] Everyone all across the building, lift your hands in his presence. Lift your hands in the presence of God right now. Ask him, ""With everything you have in your heart, with everything you have within you, I need the crumbs that fall from the master's table. Let the blessings of God fall upon my home. Come on and declare it right now. Let the blessings of God fall upon my home, upon my family, upon my mind, upon my thoughts, upon my heart."" Come on and declare it even right now. Let the blessings of God I speak the blessings. I speak the grace. I speak the glory. I speak the power may fall upon everything that's broken. Upon everything that is out of order, upon everything that is disconnected, upon everything the enemy has tried to confuse. Let it fall upon rebellion. Let it fall upon it now in Jesus name. And I declare that God's best is falling upon you. That God's will is falling upon you. That God's purpose is being done in your life. That the favor of God is resting upon you. The glory of God shines upon you. I say rise and shine. Let God be exalted. [Music] I just need to drop. I don't need a whole lot. I just need your drops. I don't deserve it, God, but let your mercy bring it. [Music] Bless you God. Bless you God. Bless you God. Bless you God. Father in the name of Jesus, I thank you that you're letting the crumbs fall, the drops. But Lord, your word says that you will bring showers of blessings. [Music] streams in the desert, rivers in a dry land, the times of refreshing from the spirit of the Lord. So Lord, open the floodgates of heaven and let it rain upon us in Jesus' name. We give your name the praise. In the name of Jesus, every believer shouted and said hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. And amen again. Come on and bless that wonderful name. Bless the high name. Bless the incomparable name. Bless the unparalleled name of Jesus. [Music] Hallelujah. Bless you. You may take your seat in the presence of the Lord. Surely our God is good. [Music] The Bible says that his mercy is everlasting and the truth of the Lord endures to every generation. Day unto day, night unto night, the name of the Lord is to be praised. From the rising of the sun to the going down of the sun, his name is worthy of praise. Are you ready for the word of the Lord? I want you to grab your Bibles, please, if you would, and open them to 1 Corinthians chapter 13. Father, I pray that your word would fall upon receptive hearts and open ears. We would hear what you're saying. Each one of us individually, Lord, I pray that where we need to be challenged, challenge us. Where we need to be changed, change us. Where we need to be encouraged, encourage us. instruct us through your word and teach us today. May this be an experience that you have ordained in Jesus name. Amen. And amen again. All right, Bibles are open to 1 Corinthians 13. We are jumping back in our series on love. We've had a very, very good break. It's been a wonderful break, hasn't it? Uh Reverend Far sure enough shared with us both of those messages and they were absolutely amazing. I'm uh still praising God for the clarity and the power and the relevance of those of that word. And we had a beautiful uh Sunday on yesterday on last week celebrating our 30th church anniversary. Wasn't it a blessing? Amen. So now I want us to jump back in now and uh let's start talking about this topic of love. And before we begin uh discussing this and talking about it, I just want to let you know that I already know in preparing this message that this is going to be tough for many of us to hear as many of these messages have been. Um I think it challenges us to reframe how we see 1 Corinthians 13. We always hear this uh passage on love as a poem that is uh given and read at weddings and we think that it's about affection and love and it's about butterflies in your stomach and it's about happily ever after and all of those beautiful things that weddings make us think of. And um I am not saying stop reading it at weddings. Of course you should continue to do that because it certainly weddings is about love. But I want to tell you that Paul didn't write it for that purpose at all. Uh Paul wrote this as a stinging rebuke to the Corinthian church and how they have misplaced love and lost it in the midst of their gifts and the midst of their spirituality. And so he kind of reorientates reorients them reorientates them whatever that word is. He reutens them back to what uh love is meant to be. And that's how we want to teach it because we teach the scriptures out of the spirit of the scriptures and how they were written. Amen. And so to do that, it's tough to hear the way that the first uh early church, the church at Corinth, would have heard and read this passage. This is how they would have read it. It would have stopped them in their tracks. It would have gotten offended at what Paul was suggesting and saying and it would have been a strong issue of conviction for many of them as his entire letter was. This book of first Corinthians is not a book of celebration. It is a book of correction. He is correcting so many wrong and misguided and broken issues in the Corinthian church. I mean he begins with chapter one and moves right on down through the chapter on the resurrection, the chapter regarding offering. I mean he just speaks one issue after the other issue after the other issue. And here he's doing the same thing. So I want us to find 1 Corinthians chapter number 13 in our Bibles and let's uh begin to read uh starting at verse number four. We're going to start each one of these messages the same way. And so 1 Corinthians 13 beginning at verse 4, whatever translation you may have, would you follow along with us? Bible says, ""Love suffers long and diskind. Love envys not. Love vaunts not itself. Love does not boast and brag. Love is not puffed up. Love is not arrogant. Love does not behave itself inappropriately."" King James says unseemly. Other version says rudely. Love does not seek her own. It is not easily provoked. It thinks no evil. Other version says that love does not keep a record of wrong or is not mindful of the evil. And then it says love rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth. Love does not celebrate sin. Now, here's what love does do. That's all the things love does not do. Love does bear all things. Love does believe the best in all things. Love does hope for the best in all things. Love does endure all things. Love verse 8 never fails. Love never fails. Just for the purpose of reminding us of this the construct of this entire series, you'll remember that we stated that there are 13 phrases in what we've just read that speaks about love in the action voice or as an in the action uh voice. It is active. It's an action. These are verbs. Even when the word is not a natural verb, Paul verbizes it. He makes it a verb to stress his point that love does something. Love does something. Love is an action. It is not a feeling. It is an action. Are you guys with me so far? And not only that, but Paul personifies love. He makes love a person. He is not saying that Maron does these things or Bob does these things or Susan does these things. He's saying the love that is supposed to be in Marlin will do these things. The love that is supposed to be in Bob or Susan will do these things. He says this is what love does even when Maron doesn't want to. And so he takes love away from the responsibility of the person and he makes love its own responsibility. And we know that because the Bible teaches in the full arc of the scriptures as it relates to love. It teaches that God is love. And so it is the God in Marlon Bob Susan that is doing the loving. And when Marlon, Bob, Susan is unplugged from God, then they cannot love correctly. That God is love. Therefore, God does love through us. That when you're loving outside of God, as as affectionate as you may feel, as passionate as it may be, as good as it may feel to you, it is not agape, oh love. It is not God's love and only God's love is the kind that endures and never fails. Everybody understand that right? And so this is this is the way I want us to uh approach this passage as we as we teach it. Now these actions are represented in these ways. Love is patient and kind. These are the 13 action verbs. Love is patient and kind. Love is not rude. Love is not selfish. Love is not easily angered. Love does not envy. Love doesn't boast, nor is it arrogant. Love keeps no record of wrong. It doesn't even think on the evil. It doesn't consider the evil, the evil of the past. Love does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. Now, we've stated that the construct of this series is is given to us in five movements. Five not five moments but movements. Love is is fluid. It is moving. It is active. So, I want you to think in terms of movements. I want us to move through the understanding of love. If we take these 13 phrases, these 13 action phrases, and we were to uh categorize them, we would categorize them, it would require us to move some of these phrases and put them in different spaces and places in order to get a proper categorization of it. But as I look at this, I find five significant categories that these 13 phrases fit in. And these five categories I'm calling movements. And here's what they are. The first is who love is. Love is patient and kind. The second movement here is what love does not do. This is what love will not do. Love re does not envy. It does not boast. It does not behave inappropriately. It does not keep a record of wrongs. And it does not rejoice in iniquity. But it rejoices in the truth. That's what love will not do. Now, I will do all of those things. But I cannot do those things without love restraining and convicting me. If I can do those things to someone else and not be convicted by by my by love is because love isn't there. Are you understanding that? Love is not what you say. Love is what you do. All right. And so the third movement is who love is not. Who love is what love does not do. Thirdly, who love is not. Love is not selfish and love is not easily angered. Love is not selfish and love does not have a short fuse. It is not easily angered. It takes a lot for love to fall into wrath. You cannot provoke love then you can provoke me but not love. Are you understanding the idea? And this lastly is this this next is what love does. This is this is the positive side of love. He've given us all of the negative side of love. Now he addresses the positives of love. This is what love does. And nowhere does he say love stares into your eyes all night long. Nowhere does he say love gushes over your presence when you are near. Nowhere does he say love begs for your approval and your like. Says love bears all things even the bad things. Love believes all things and this believes all things meaning it believes the best in all things. This does love does not rejoice in in iniquity. When you lie love calls a lie a lie. doesn't believe lies, but it believes the best in all things. You ain't where you need to be, but you getting there. That's love. Love hopes all the best in all things. And then, of course, love never fails. Number five is how love wins. And forgive me for not having that correct on on your notes. Please jot it down the right way. How love wins. Love never fails. Love never fails. All right. So I want us to look today at the remaining portion of love of love's love's characteristics in the second movement. What love does not do. The boundaries of love. What love does not do. This is what love refuses to do. We're going to look at some of these phrases in verses four, five, and six. particularly four of those phrases in those two verses. Four of those phrases in those two verses. Are you with me? All right. First one is love does not act up. Love does not behave inappropriately. Love does not behave inappropriately. Some of the translation says love is not rude. And we'll talk more about what that means. Love does not behave selfishly. Love does not behave selfishly. And then next, love does not keep score. Love does not keep score. Love does not figure out who owes who, who hurt who, when you hurt me last, what you said, when you did what you did, love doesn't keep score. The King James version says, ""Love doesn't even think evil."" And what it means is that love does not count and consider the evil that was done. And we'll talk more about that. Love does not celebrate sin. Love calls sin out. Love doesn't celebrate sin. Love does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in truth. Are y'all ready to listen? Are we here? Ready to start? All right. So, we're going to talk about these four phrases that you just saw. And when you look at these four phrases, they are best described in one simple phrase. And that is these four things describe what we call toxic love. Toxic love. This is when love is toxic. And love is toxic when loving you damages me. When loving you damages me, it doesn't build me, it damages me. It doesn't better me, it breaks me. It doesn't lift me up, it pulls me down. When loving you damages me. Now, not when loving you hurts me, because you're all going to be hurt by love. But your hurt should not incur a damage. A damage is a wound that now has to be healed. When loving you is wounding me, that's because what we are in is a toxic relationship. That's right. And we're going to look at toxicity the way that Paul looks at it. Here's the thing I want you to capture and jot down as our primary thought. It is possible to be in love and still be in danger. It is possible to be in love and still be in danger. It's possible to say the right words, I love you, and still wound the person that you're speaking to. It doesn't mean that the person who is loving you doesn't love you. It just means they're not loving you healthily and they're not loving you right. Are you understanding that idea? We love out of our souls. We love out of our souls. That's how we love. Whenever you are loving someone else, you love out of your soul. It takes a healthy soul to love healthily. If your soul is broken, bruised, battered, traumatized, then you love out of that soul. Are you listening to me? And so, a broken soul will love brokenly. A battered soul will love batteredly. A traum traumatized soul will love traumatically. Had to think about these Because you love out of your soul. Are you understanding that? Right. And so whenever there is something broken in me, then I love out of that. And if I don't plug my love into a different source, then the best I can give is toxicity because I'm loving out of brokenness. Is is this making sense? And whenever I love you out of brokenness, I'm not plugged into a different source. I'm loving out of my own strength. I'm loving out of my own experiences. I'm loving out of my own past. I'm loving out of my own fears. I'm loving out of my own issues. I'm loving out of my own guilt. I'm loving out of my own pain. I'm living out of my own history. When I'm loving you out of that, what you are going to get is the results, the remnants of that toxicity, of that brokenness. And I will say something. I love you, but my actions, my life can't measure up to what I've said because my soul is broken. Wow. Are you hearing it? Now, I want you to come here. Please come here. I know you're in church and I know you got your hallelujah on and I know you got your thank you Jesus is all down pack. I know you got your Sunday go to meeting clothes on. Everybody in this room and watching me right now by stream, there is something broken in your soul. Every single one of us have some area of our life that God still has to stitch back together. [Applause] And if you plug into you and try to love me out of that, that brokenness is going to come through the the cord. You've got to plug into a different source in order to love me differently. Are you guys understanding this? It's possible to for someone to claim they love you and still live in a way that leaves you emotionally bruised, spiritually manipulated, and relationally discarded. We live in a time of toxic relationships. And this is now coming to the forefront in much of our modern day culture with this new clarity. We have toxic communities. We have toxic friendships. We have toxic work environments. We have toxic co-workers. We have these toxic cultures that are in different places throughout our life and experiences. And all of us experience some level of toxicity in in our lives and in this culture. And I love it that we're now calling out toxicity. That's toxic. That's not good. That's not healthy. I got to get away from that. That because we're starting to understand that what breaks me, what breaks and damages me is not something I need to be connected to. And so we're learning how to disconnect from that thing that is damaging us. And I think that's wonderful. I I'm loving to see that in our modern culture. But this is not something new. Paul was talking about that kind of toxicity 2,000 years ago in this text. He was addressing that toxicity and he was actually addressing it in a macro capacity. But he used creative words that help paint pictures about the micro reality of those macro ideas. And so the words he is creating as we look at these words that Paul uses, it helps us understand what toxicity looks like in the context of a relationship. Before we start looking at this, I just want to mention to you that there is a theological uh genius of the um of the of the 4th century. His name was St. Augustine. And St. Augustine in his book on the city of God, he defines what sin is. And he makes an interesting connection when he defines sin. He defines sin in the context of love. And here's what Augustine says. He says that sin is disordered love. Wow. He said sin is disordered love or rather sin is love out of order. It is when love is backwards. When love has its order changed. In other words, he was saying sin is not always about loving the wrong things. Sin is also about loving the right things in the wrong way. Sin is not just about loving the wrong things. It's about loving the right things sometimes. Yes, it's about loving the right things but in the wrong way. It is a disorder. It's a chaos love. It is an unspirited love. Whenever God created the world, that first verse of Genesis chapter 1 tells us the world was in disarray, in disorder. It was in chaos. That the world was in chaos. Here's what it says. That the world was in the deep. It was chaotic. And the spirit of God had to hover over the waters and over the deep because the chaos needed the Holy Spirit to bring order to it. And when God created, he created and he brought order out of chaos. He brought order out of chaos when the Holy Spirit was applied to the disorder. If there's chaos in a relationship, it cannot become cannot come into order until the spirit of God gets applied to that chaos. And the longer the chaos exists, the longer the spirit is absent from that relationship, the more damage the relationship does. Because chaos brings damage everywhere it goes. You understanding this? Are you getting what I'm saying to you? And so it's about loving sometimes the right things in the wrong way, the right people in the wrong way, loving them at the wrong time, loving them in the wrong proportion, loving them with the wrong motives, loving them toward the wrong goal, loving them in the wrong aims, loving them for the wrong reasons. Toxic love is loving from a dysfunctional source, disconnected from God's original design, the way he originally designed love to be. You disconnect it from that design and you turn love inward in itself. And when you love from that dysfunction, it brings about toxicity or it brings about chaos. It may look like love, may sound like love, but it is certainly not love. Here's the order. Can I give you the order? Here's the order. Number one, we're meant to love God above all things. Number two, we're meant to love our neighbor as ourselves. Number three, we're meant to love ourselves properly, the way God loves us. And number four, we're meant to love created things in moderation and submission to God. God, neighbor, self, things. Now that's the order. God, neighbor, spouse, children, friend, co-orker, boss, you name it. God, neighbor, self, things. If you love things, in the order of where God is, that's called idolatry. If you love self in the order where neighbor is, that's called self-centeredness. Are you hearing me? There are people who love things more than God, themsel more than others. And whenever you get it out of order, you will demand for the thing or person you're loving to respond to you on the level that you've put them on. When they were never designed to respond to you on that level, what makes it toxic is whenever you are loving yourself over others. When you put yourself first above others and you're loving you more than you're loving them and you expect them to love you like you love you. And that is what narcissism is about. Narcissism is the demand for you to see me the way I see me. For you to love me the way I love me. And if I love me more than I love you, the narcissistic attitude says that you're wrong. something's wrong with you, that you're not loving me the way that I think I should be loved because I come first. And the moment you do that, every time you interact with that person, you take a knife and you're cutting them every single time. And they walk away bleeding and all they had was a conversation. And they walk away bleeding and all they had was breakfast. They walk away bleeding and all y'all had was a disagreement because you got it out of order. Are you hearing what I'm saying to you? If you love pleasure more than you love God, if you love pleasure more than you love self, you will wreck yourself for the sake of having fun. That's why alcohol and drugs is so real. because we love pleasure more than self. And we will wreck ourselves just to get high. We'll wreck ourselves just to sleep around. We'll wreck ourselves just to have a boyfriend. We'll wreck ourselves just to get a girlfriend. We'll wreck ourselves just to get a job. We'll wreck ourselves just to get more money. We'll wreck ourselves. Toxicity is when you got it out of order. So let me give you the order again. God first, others next, self third, things last. And if you ever get the order out of place, you bring about wrecks. Are you listening to me? I wrote these things down. Let me just read them to you. If you love self more than others, when we value our comfort over someone else's dignity, we act selfishly and unjustly. It's kind of what I just said. When you love success more than integrity, when you prioritize ambition over righteousness, you lie, cheat, steal, compromise just to get ahead. You see, sin isn't just wrongdoing. What Augustine was saying is sin is wrong loving. When you love created things more than the creator, this is called idolatry. It's when good things like money, relationships, family, you name it. When good things become ultimate things, when good becomes the highest in your life. Are you hearing what I'm saying? When you love pleasure more than you love self, you will wreck yourself. All right. Are we together? I think you guys got it right. Are you here with me? Last thing I want to say about toxic love. This is critical for you to hear. Whenever love is toxic, and then we're going to get into the text. Whenever love is toxic, love gets weaponized. When love is toxic, love becomes weaponized. It it crosses the line. It silences others. It shows these three kinds of expressions. Whenever love is toxic, when love is toxic, expression of a toxic love, number one is it is aggressive. It's aggressive. It asserts its will, its desire, its wishes over onto another person. It is aggressive. It cares nothing about the other person. It only cares about what it wants when it wants it, the way it wants it. It is aggressive. It bulldozes its way in. It's loudest in the argument. It's the first to be seen, the last to be heard. It makes its voice volume and thinks that the volume of its voice gives value to its argument. It's because it's aggressive. The second expression that is toxic. Toxic. Aggressive love is toxic and passive love is toxic. Passive love lets you run all over the person. It becomes a doormat. It enables your aggression. It enables your bullying. It gives credence to your own bullying nature. It makes you think hurting me is the right way to love me. Passive love speaks of an insecurity and a low sense of self-worth and self-esteem. So much so that it enables the violator to become a violator. It makes the villain more of a villain and robs that villain of the benefit of conviction. It doesn't allow the villain to feel anything bad about what the villain is doing because passive love accepts it as if it's right. Passive love screams in silence, cries in secret. Passive love is broken behind closed doors until its soul has been broken. Its voice has been robbed. It's invisible and it's unheard. And when you're loving someone with a passive expression, that's toxic. And when you're being loved by someone and you give them a passive expression, that's toxic. Three expressions of love. The first one is what class? Aggressive love. The second one is what class? Passive love. Who knows what the third one is? Passive aggressive love. Passive aggressive is aggressive love smiling all the time. It is aggressive love that keeps a record of wrongs and gets you back in ways that you haven't yet seen. It is behind the scenes rage, behind the scenes anger. It is to manipulate so that it can control. Passive aggressive is to hate with a smile on your face. Passive aggressive is to stick and jab all the while hiding its hand. I wrote this down. Passive aggressive is anger with a smiling mask on. Passive aggressive love makes the person who is passive aggressive inherently dishonest and untruthful because the response forces the person to lie. The response says I'm happy though I'm angry. The response says I accept you though I really reject you. The response goes along to get along. And when there is a vulnerable moment, passive aggressive stabs in the back because it doesn't have the courage to confront to the face. It hides from confrontation. It avoids telling the truth. and it lives itself by learning how to mask its true reality. There is a fourth expression that's not toxic. It's healthy. Aggressive love toxic. Passive love toxic. Passive aggressive love toxic. The fourth expression is healthy. It is assertive love. And assertive love is the opposite of everything that Paul expresses in these four in these two verses. Are you ready to jump in it? All right. You sure? All right. Let's get started. There are four faces to toxic love. Four faces of toxic love. The first face is found in the text that says, ""Love is not rude."" Love is not rude. It doesn't cross boundaries or behave dishonorably. Love isn't rude. The first face of false love or toxic love is love is not rude. The second face is love is not selfish. Do you see it in the text? Love is not selfish. That's the second face of toxic love. The third face of toxic love is love keeps no record of wrongs. It doesn't store up grievances to use later. That's passive aggressive. It keeps no record of wrongs. And the last face of false love or toxic love is love does not rejoice in wrongdoing. It doesn't celebrate the fall of others or tolerate sin when truth is at stake. These four traits can be they can be uh they can be changed into four different words that I want you to write down and jot and take note of. These four faces have four words attached to them. This is the whole of what toxicity is whenever it relates to love. Number one, it is the word control. The word control. When the Bible says love is not rude, love does not behave itself unseemingly, the word here is control, that love does not use its bravado. It doesn't use its bravado or its sharp tongue or its sarcasm or its anger. Love doesn't use its bravado in order for it to control your reactions and your responses. The word is control. Secondly, the word is manipulation. Love is not selfish. It doesn't manipulate you to get what it wants. It doesn't come to the relationship with an ulterior motive. That's right. It doesn't scheme how it can change your desires in order for your desires to line up with its desires. Love does not manipulate. Number three, the third word is retaliation. Love doesn't get you back. Love never gets you back. It doesn't retaliate. It doesn't keep a record. Uh the word logizomi is the word for keep a record of wrong or records. It's logismi. That is an accounting word. It's a word that is in accounting. And what it means is that it does not have a ledger. It does not have a blue book or a ledger of all of the faults of the person it's loving. And when necessary, it can go back to that ledger and call up a fault five years ago and bring that fault front and center. Love forgives quickly and forgives fully. Raise your hands in this room if you've ever been forgiven of something. Raise your hand if somebody has forgiven you for something you've done. Raise your hands. All right, I tell the truth. How did that feel? It's liberating. It's freedom. It gives you a liberation that you've been forgiven. The guilt is still there. That's between you and God. The hurt that you hurt them is still between you and you. But to be fully and freely forgiven by another person, it is liberating. Can I give you the word that that forgiveness can supply to both people? The word is deliverance. You get delivered when you get forgiven. You get delivered. When you get forgiven, you get bound and enslaved when you're held to an account of a debt that you can't pay. Love forgives because love seeks deliverance of the person it's loving. And the fourth word I want you to jot down is avoidance of truth. Toxic love is controlling. Toxic love is manipulating. Toxic love is retaliatory. And toxic love avoids the truth. It will not confront iniquity. It rejoices in all things being cool, calm, and collected. I ain't going to tell them I I ain't and I like to keep peace in the house. That's toxic. Well, for peace sake, I just I just ignore it and keep on going. That's toxic. It doesn't rejoice in inequity. It rejoices in the truth. Hallelujah. All right. All right. So, let's let's get started. What an introduction. Let's get started with the first one. Love is not rude. Here's what it says. It says, ""Love does not behave itself."" Verse five, in an unseammly way doesn't behave itself rudely or inappropriately. It's an interesting Greek word. It's the word ukasone and it means it means without form a a love that has no form to it. In classical Greek it meant formless. It comes from the root word schema which means to have a form to have an outward form. A schema means to have no form. There is nothing that is appropriate or right about this kind of love. It has no form. In modern Greek, if you go to Greece today and you were to say that word uh today, akema, it means ugly. It means to be ugly. Right? Are you listening to me? Paul is saying that love does not act ugly. Love does not act in a formless capacity where it has no structure that is based upon the relationship that it's in. Love responds to the nature of the form of the relationship. The form of the relationship determines how love treats that person. When you treat a person based on the form of that relationship, that is called honor. Listen carefully. The nature of the relationship determines how the person is being treated. The way I treat my friends is not the same way I treat my father. With my friends, I can dap it up with them. I can say, ""What's up, dog?"" But with my dad, the form of that relationship demands a different kind of response. If I were to come to my dad and say, ""What's up, dog? What's up, dog?"" That is called ugly. It is dishonoring. And I'd probably be on the floor needing to get picked up. You don't treat your girlfriends the way you treat your mother. Are you hearing what I'm saying to you? Because the nature of the relationship determines how you ought to respond and interact with that individual. What does the relationship require? Whenever you respond when you interact with them according to the nature to the nature to the nature to the nature of that relationship. When you respond according to that relationship's nature, you are honoring the relationship. Are you hearing me? So Peter said, ""Husbands, honor the wife as the weaker vessels."" Are you hearing what I'm saying? So that your prayers be not hindered. He says, ""Honor the wife as the weaker vessel."" Now, I got to teach this because we have new members in our church who have not been in our church for for for years. Many of you already know this if you've been here for years, but I got to teach this for those of you that may be new or just have joined recently. Weaker there does not mean weaker in our modern-day understanding. It means fragile and delicate. It is it is the idea of a highly valued porcelain vase. And a highly valued porcelain vase is a weaker vessel than a styrofoam cup. A styrofoam cup, you can drop a styrofoam cup on the ground and it'll just keep on bouncing back because it doesn't have delicacy in it. There isn't value in it. There isn't a high sense of value in a styrofoam cup. But a porcelain vase, you don't drop those. If you drop it, you're going to shatter it. You protect a porcelain vase. It is the weaker vessel, the more fragile vessel, the more valuable vessel. And he says, ""Honor, honor the wife as a more fragile, valuable, highly esteemed vessel. Don't treat her like a styrofoam cup. When you talk to her, you talk to her by honoring the nature of that relationship. When you engage with her, even in disagreement, you disagree with her by honoring the nature of that relationship. Are you hearing what I'm saying to you? When you go out to spend your money, you spend your money by honoring the relationship you have with your wife. Her opinion matters. Her voice matters. Her ideas matter. She's valued in your eyes. You don't talk to other women on the phone late at night because that's your friend, girl. You honor that relationship. You don't meet with other women behind closed doors or y'all going to hang out with each other. You honor that relationship. It is a valuable relationship. She is the more valuable vessel. Is anybody hearing what I'm saying to you? Every time you treat her like a porcelain, like like a styrofoam cup, you are devaluing the relationship and you are being a schemer. You're being ugly. You have no form. Are you getting what I'm saying to you? And if she allows you to treat her like a porcelain cup, like like a styrofoam cup, it is demonstrated that there is a codependent toxicity in that relationship. You are you getting what I'm I know it's hard, but can you hear me? [Music] What makes it toxic is the dishonor. Ladies, you honor the relationship of that man. The Bible says very clearly. The Bible says he is to honor you as the more valuable vessel. Yes. The Bible also says that he is to love you by giving his life for you. Yes. But the Bible also says, and I know you don't want to hear it, but I got to tell you what it says. It says you are to submit to him as unto the Lord. It says to see that you reverence your husband. To reverence is to respect him and to honor him. And hear me very clearly. Your husband needs respect like he needs air. He needs air like he needs respect. Respect is how he breathes. Honor is how he breathes. It's like the blood in his veins. And when he's dishonored, when he's disrespected, it robs him of the Godgiven masculine nature that God put inside of him to protect, provide, be priest of, and be prophet of. It takes him out of his place. You do not win when you emasculate him. You do not win when you tear him down with your words. You do not win whenever you you you deconstruct his moral value by cutting him down with language and tongue. Are you hearing what I'm saying to you? You respect him. It says, ""See to it that you reverence your husband. Now, here is where I struggle or we struggle, pastor. What if he ain't respectable? I have one question to ask you. Just one. That's it. Just one. Is he is or is he ain't your husband? pastor. I mean, what if she ain't treating me like no porcelain vase? I'm supposed to treat her like that? What if she treat me like a styrofoam cup? You mean I still got to treat her like she a porcelain vase, but I get treated like I'm a styrofoam cup every day, day in and day out. I have one question to ask you. Is she is or is she ain't? your wife. What is the nature of your relationship? Is a ring involved? Did y'all stand before a preacher? Do you have a license hanging on a wall somewhere? Did a judge say thumbs up? Is you legally connected? Is she is or is he is or is he ain't or is she ain't your husband or your wife? You honor the nature of the relationship. Is anybody hearing what I'm saying to you? [Applause] There are times whenever our kids don't act like our kids. If you've gone through the terrible teenage years, then you know it ain't enough for them to say, ""Ugh, I can't stand you."" over them and say to and you be wanting them. Well, they're your kids, so you can do a little bit of that, but at the end of the day, your kids, when they hungry, feed them. When they naked, go get them some clothes. When they're wrong, correct them. When they're hurting, help them. Why? Because they deserve it. No, because they're your kids. That's your daddy. That's your parents. They don't deserve it. Not all the time. But them your parents. That's your grandmama. This is your [Applause] granddaddy. That's your granddaddy. Honor the nature of the relationship. Because dishonor violates what's sacred. Oh man, this is hard. Dishonor violates sacred. God put that person in your life. God, God, God, God, put that person in your life. Not for you to like them, not for you to be happy with them all the time. God put him in your life as a sacred choice. for you to honor that sacred that sanctity of that choice. Are you hearing what I'm saying to you? I know you got some bosses, some supervisors and managers and employers you don't like. I mean, always telling me what to do. Here it come. Here it come. I know I'm late. I know. I always got to mention what I ain't doing. Lord, he looking over my shoulder. Look at him. Look at him. I want he go back to his office and mind his own business. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. And he probably is a micromanager and he probably does have some culture issues. But that's your job. That's where you work. Are you hearing what I'm saying to you? And if you can't honor your employer, then quit and get a new job. But don't stay on that job and dishonor this relationship because every time you dishonor a relationship that God has placed you in, and don't tell me God didn't put you there cuz you prayed for the job. You was on the interview. Lord, I sure hope I get this job. And then when you get the job, you dishonor the person who gave you the job. Are you hearing what I'm saying to you? Right? The friend in your life, honor that friend. That person is a friend. Don't let them abuse you. Don't let them manipulate you. Don't let them use you. Honor the relationship. Because when you dishonor any relationship, you dishonor what is sacred about that relationship. Now, this is going to be tough to hear. Are you hearing me? When you dishonor the people that God told you to love, you are not just dishonoring them, you are dishonoring God. That's why the Bible says, ""Do everything you do as unto the Lord."" Are you guys still with me? [Applause] Romans chapter 13 and verse 7. It's not going to be on the screen, but here's what it says. Here's what it says. Give honor to whom honor is due. The word do means it is owed. Give honor to whom honor is owed. The relationship pulls a demand. The relationship has a demand. And that demand is based on the nature of that relationship. Are you guys still with me? All right. Can we move on a little bit? All right. Let's go to the second one. I want to move on to the second one. Man, that's all good. I got the Wow, that's Oh, that's good. Can I say this though? Dishonor is control in disguise. Dishonor is to devalue the relationship and by virtue you devalue the dignity of the person. And the more you do it, the more you devalue them. The more you do it, the more you devalue them. And when you lessen them in your eyes or in their eyes, it is a form of control. Rudeness is control. Sarcasm is control. Evil speaking, mean is control. An evil eye, an aggressive nature, it is control. Passive aggressive, it is control. What makes it ugly is it's not the way God intended for people to interact with each other. It is against God's original design. Are you guys still with me here? All right. Ready to look at the next one? Love. Number two, love is not selfish. Love doesn't manipulate for its own gain. Love does not try to manipulate. It doesn't demand center stage. That's what Paul is saying in his language. In Paul's language, he uses the word oo which he means not. And then he uses a Greek word zeti. And zeti is a word that he that he puts in the active voice. He puts it in the active voice and he puts in the indicative mood. And what he says is that it it is always present tense active voice indicative. The fact of it is that it never seeks its own way. It never never never seeks its own way. It never puts itself center stage. It's not what love does. Love occupies the space in your life. Listen, that is most helpful to your life. Amen. Love occupies the space in your life that is most helpful to your life. Right now, I'm occupying the space of your pastor. What I'm saying is most helpful to you. So, I occupy that space. That space, that space, not me. That space, not my desire. That space demands that I stand on a stage and talk to you. The relationship demands this happens in this space. I can't demand for you to listen to me. You can get up and walk out. You can go to sleep and don't act like you ain't never done that [Applause] before. I can't demand for you to listen to me because then that pushes the boundary over into selfishness. and self-centeredness. Nor can I tell you something that only feeds my own benefit. I have to tell you what God says to tell you for your own good. Amen. The Corinthian church, the Corinthian church was in this toxic experience where they were they were they were showing up at the communion and they were only giving communion to those who were wealthy and rich and powerful. The poor had to find their own ways to eat. They would come into the communion and they would come to the Lord's table and gratify themselves and they would eat the bread and all the wine and they would they would rob the communion table. They would demand other people to follow their their their laws and their religious precepts the way that they followed them. They would demand you can't eat meat offered unto idols. They would impose their legalism on others in the church. They would speak in their spiritual garb, spiritual languages at the expense of everybody else in the church. They would grab the microphone. Well, there was no microphone in those days. And they would prophesy and speak in tongues and demand everybody else in the church listen to them. And this one would do it. And that one would do it. and that woman would do it. And they would compete against each other on who had the best and prettiest and nicest tongue to speak in. Nobody was edified. Nobody was developed. Nobody grew. The prophets would speak and he would give a word and someone else stand up in the back, give a word, someone else give a word, and there were five, six, seven, eight, nine of them all giving a word at the same time. And the spirit of competition rose in the church. because they were trying to bring themselves center stage to make everybody else think that they were more spiritual than anybody else. It was spiritual manipulation. Paul says this is not love. He says, ""Love does not revolve around itself."" Wow. Then I got to stop. Love us. Love does not look for its own things. Love doesn't engage in the relationship with an ulterior motive to satisfy itself. It doesn't use people as things. It doesn't see people as objects to be controlled and manipulated and conquered. That's not what love is. Love puts itself last and puts the other person first. I got to stop there. We'll come back at Love is not selfish and pick it up next week. Woo! Stand on your feet. Stand on your feet. Forgive me for the time. Lift your hands before the [Music] Lord. Come on and lift your hands before God all across this building. Lord Jesus. Repeat after me. Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, teach me how to love. Teach me how to love. Show me how to love. Show me how to love the people you placed in my life. And to honor them. And to honor to honor every relationship to honor every that you've given to me. Forgive me. Forgive me. For rudeness for rudess, inappropriate behavior inappropriate. Forgive me. for being aggressive. for being aggressive when I should have listened. When I should have For being passive for being passive when I should have spoke up when I should have spoke up. For being passive aggressive progressive when I should have told the truth. I should have told the truth. Teach me how to love people. How to love me. The way you love me. the way you love me. And I'll give you praise. And I'll give you glory. I'll give you glory. In Jesus name. in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. And amen again. Come on and give God praise. Come on and bless the name of the [Music] Lord. All right, we're getting ready to go home. Before we make the decision to go home, if you're in this room and you've never given Jesus your life, you never asked him in your heart, you are not born again, you are not saved, I want you quickly right now in this experience, in this very space to get out of your seat, tell the person you're standing beside, excuse me, make your way down here to this altar and get in the place God's called you to. You know being born again is right. You know giving your life to God is right. You know, accepting Jesus in your heart as your savior is right. Do not let the enemy convince you to stay where you are. Get out of your seat and come. Secondly, if you're in this room and you know that God's called you to unite and connect with this local church, you know this is home. You can feel it. You can sense it. You've been coming for a while and you know that this is home. Or maybe you're here for the very first time today, but you know it. And you'll know it when it's right. You'll know it when it's right. Get out of your seat right now. Find the closest owl that you can and come meet us right down here at this altar. I'm asking you if you've never given your life to Christ to make a decision and come. And I'm asking you if you've never joined this church, but God told you this is where he wants you to be. I want you to get out of your seat and make your way and come. You can do it. It is a big decision, but you're able to make it. Come on and give God praise for these who are making up their mind. Who are making up their mind. Come on and give God praise for these while they're coming. If you are watching this by stream, zoom in, please, and listen to what I'm trying to say to you now. Bless you. Bless you so much. Bring her on here. Come get a Greg if you don't mind. And my sister here, my brother there. Come on and get them. Come on and give God praise for all these who are making up their minds. If you're watching this by Zoom and you know that God has called you by stream and you know God's called you to get born again and saved or to connect with this local church.

I want you to assess yourself. Two things. Assess yourself. How am I honoring the relationship that God's placed in my life? Whether it's a friend, whether it's a brother, whether it's a parent, whether it's a spouse, whether it's a child. Am I truly honoring that relationship? How can I honor it better? How can I honor it more? What is the nature of that relationship? Second thing I want you to do, it's going to be a little hard. I want you to go to significant people in your life. Start with one. That way, you know, it won't be torturous the whole week. But, Lord, I got four more people to go to. Start with one. And I want you to ask them, do you feel that I honor you the way that you should be honored in this relationship? You are my You fill in the blank. Do I honor you like that? And if the answer is yes, give me a thumbs up. Y'all hug it out and go get ice cream. If the answer is no or anything other than yes, the follow-up question is how can I love you better? How can I love you? How many will do that this [Music] week? My prayer is that ice cream shops all across the city will be filled. I love you guys so so so very much this Memorial Day.

5UYiHp1xnHI,5829,927,16,"FOX and Friends First 5/26/25 FULL END SHOW | FOX BREAKING NEWS TRUMP May 26, 2025",20250526,"President Trump accusing Russian President Putin of going absolutely crazy as Moscow increases its attacks on Ukraine with President Trump now considering new sanctions against Russia. Plus, the big beautiful bill is facing an uphill battle in the Senate. What one Republican senator is saying about its chances of getting through the upper chamber. And today, we are taking the time to honor America's fallen heroes. On this Memorial Day, we are speaking to a former paratrooper who turned patriotism into a business and one veteran lawmaker on what it meant to serve his country. You're watching Fox and Friends First here on a Monday morning. I am Todd Pyro. Carly Shimis has the day off. First, let us begin with Rebecca Caster joining us live from Washington with more on the latest between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. Rebecca, Todd, their relationship is getting icy. Later this morning, President Trump will honor America's fallen at Arlington National Cemetery. But also on his mind are the tens of thousands of soldiers who've lost their lives in the Ukrainian Russian war. And he's blaming Vladimir Putin for dragging it on. I'm not happy with what Putin's doing. He's killing a lot of people. And I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. I've known him a long time. Always gotten along with him. But he's sending rockets into cities and killing people. and I don't like it at all. Okay, we're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities. I don't like it at all. The tough words come a week after Trump and Putin had a 2-hour phone call when the Russian president supposedly agreed to immediately start ceasefire negotiations with Ukraine. But then Russia went and launched several large aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities over the weekend, including over 350 drone strikes last night. On Truth Social, Trump said, ""I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely crazy."" Likewise, President Zalinski is doing his country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems. I don't like it and it better stop. Trump says he's considering putting more sanctions on Russia. While elsewhere in Europe, he's agreed to delay the 50% tariff on the EU after getting a call from the European Commission President. She asked for an extension on the June 1st date and she said she wants to get down to serious negotiation because I I told you specifically, I mean, I told anybody that would listen, they have to do that. On Truth Social again, Trump says he agreed to the extension and the new deadline for the EU to make a deal is July 9th. The commission president says Europe is ready to begin talks immediately to save its close relationship uh in trade with the US. Todd, Rebecca Caster live for us. Rebecca, thank you. Now to a Fox News alert. At least 11 people taken to hospitals after a shooting broke out in a North Carolina beach town overnight. Police say it happened about 30 minutes north of Myrtle Beach around 9:30 a.m. 9:30 p.m. I should say 90 minutes after the shots rang out. Police declared it an isolated incident, saying there's no threat to the community and investigation is now underway. A manhunt underway in Arkansas right now for a former police chief turned convicted murderer who escaped prison over the weekend. Officials say the inmate was serving a 30-year sentence for first-degree murder. He was found guilty of shooting and killing a city water worker who was found dead inside his work truck. He had also been sentenced for rape. Arkansas police are warning the public to stay alert. And five more people have been arrested in connection with the prison break in New Orleans, including the father of one of the escapees. That brings the total to 12 people who are now accused of helping the inmates either before, during, or after their escape from jail. It has been 10 days since the escape. Five of the 10 inmates are still on the run. Police are reminding the the public that these men are considered armed and dangerous. Some sad news to report now. Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson has died at the age of 79 months after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The family says they are celebrating that he is now with the Lord. A Louisiana native, Robertson played football at Louisiana Tech, where, get this, he was the starting quarterback over NFL legend Terry Bradshaw, who was his backup. What a wild footnote there. In 1972, Robertson founded the hunting company Duck Commander, and 40 years later, he rose to fame with the premiere of, of course, Duck Dynasty. Robertson used his platform to spread the word of God, even sharing his faith on Fox and Friends a few times. Watch. We show a historical account of what happens to empires, to nations, to cultures when you remove God as the firm basis for your freedom. It is religion and morality which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand. Robertson leaves behind five children, 16 grandchildren, and his wife, Miss Kay. May he rest in peace. Now to some NBA playoff action. The New York Knicks keeping their postseason alive. Basically with a 106 to 100 comeback win over the Pacers in game three of the Eastern Conference Finals. Indiana dominating early, leading by as many as 20 points before the Knicks begin to roar back in the second half. By Turner and Hard to the hole. It is a threepoint game. Tom is double crossing and shots three. Good. Oh, what a shot. Near to inbound. It's Seakum doubled. Fires three. No rebound heart. Who else? All right. Indiana still leads the series two games to one, but you know the Knicks stay alive because if you don't win game three and you go down three love, it's basically over. Unless of course it's baseball in 2004 in your Yankee Ben. That hurt. Game four tomorrow night in Indianapolis. All right, the 500 paying special tribute to the Army this Memorial Day weekend with Army helicopters flying above the cars on the first pace lap of the race in honor of the Army's upcoming 250th birthday. But then the racing started. Alex O making history as the first ever Spaniard to win the race just as Grank expected. Yes, you got to be an elite an elite athlete in order to be able to be a driver here at the Indy500. And the training is phenomenal. These guys train. I was talking to Alex Pel yesterday from Spain who has never won the Indy500, but he has won plenty of the other championship. Four out of five come in today. Yes. And he I'm I'm cheering for him to win today cuz he was such a humble guy. The workouts that they go through, they're vigorous. And it's kind of like being a professional football player with how much they train. It's a great start to the Indie Car season for Apollo who now has five wins in the first six races. It's his first Indie though, so congrats to him. And he's going to join Fox and Friends later this morning. It's Memorial Day and we are honoring the brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our nation. Two Gold Star family members will join us to discuss how they are remembering their loved ones today. Meteorologist Janastine here with your Fox weather forecast. J for this Memorial Day. So, uh you know to all of those who are celebrating or having barbecues and of course we remember uh all of those who serve the country past and present. But we do have the potential uh for severe storms. Unfortunately, large hail, damaging winds, maybe a tornado or two. Here is the setup. Uh and this is going to kind of be around for much of the work week. And we are going to see the potential for rounds of storms including hail, damaging winds, isolated tornadoes, and a lot of lightning with these and the potential uh for heavy rainfall. So, we have a severe thunderstorm warning just south of the Dallas area. Looks like a flooding is happening in and around the Dallas Fort Worth region. So, we have a severe thunderstorm watch until at least 5:00 a.m. Central time. Uh they might expand that. They might actually prolong the period of time where we have that severe thunderstorm watch in effect. And there's your risk for central Texas uh through the Arlletex, Louisiana, and Arkansas. And we saw heavy rain over the weekend. More of the same over the next couple of days. We've got this stalled front and waves of low pressure through Saturday. And even though this is coming on a, you know, 5day uh look ahead, the potential for flooding is going to be uh you know, a definite risk as we go through the rest of the work week. Here's your forecast today. So, watching those severe storms for parts of Texas through Louisiana, ar Arkansas, and then the central US also unsettled if you're traveling today. Uh the southeast so far so good, but the storm is eventually going to move sort of towards the east. Uh the Mississippi River Valley, the Tennessee and Ohio River Valley Tuesday and Wednesday. So, there's your Memorial Day forecast. Not bad for the west, uh not bad for the northeast, but it's the central part of the country we're going to watch. And then the rain forecast will shift as we go into Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, uh, for parts of the Mid-Atlantic and the Appalachins. So, just keep that in mind. And here's your upper level pattern through the rest of the week and then into June. Uh, cooler than average for parts of the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic, even over the Mississippi River Valley. And I'm sure Texas is going to appreciate a little bit cooler weather over the next couple of days. We had some weird wild weather. Like it reached real weird wild weather. It reached point where my dad was in a like it looked like he was about to shovel snow and then like we did have some snow uh in parts of New England, right? But not in not in central New Jersey. And then by the end of the night it was gorgeous. We had a rainbow. Everybody was out in shorts and it was a perfect night. So did you capture a photo? It wasn't it wasn't a good picture. Okay, we'll get into that later. Okay, fair enough. On my podcast. JB, thank you. You got it. Appreciate it. Uh, President Trump saying his administration has made further progress in talks with Iran over the weekend as the US tries to curb Thrron's nuclear program. Having to do with nuclear, we've had some very, very good talks with Iran. And I don't know if I'll be telling you anything good or bad over the next two days, but I have a feeling I might be telling you something good. We've had uh some real progress, serious progress. Georgia Congressman Rich McCormack joins me now. Congressman, this all comes after the Ayatollah said last week that talks with the US will not bring results. So obviously doesn't seem like we're all on the same page here. Are you optimistic that a nuclear deal gets done? Well, I would love to say yes, but these guys have proven time and time again that they love to export terrorism. They love to export their weapons across the world to our enemies. Uh their weapons have been used to kill US troops abroad. Uh these guys are not good. They'll lie at the drop of a hat. We've had many agreements with them in the past. They've reiged on uh if you want to say trust but verify. I don't even trust them. But but we always need to make sure they have transparency. We need to make sure they do not become a nuclear um armed nation because they have threatened the very existence of Israel. They believe that Israel is the little Satan. But guess who the big Satan is? That's us, the United States of America. They're not to be trusted at all. Yeah, it seems like President Trump is optimistic something happens this week and this week could be the week that we finally get something after decades, but we will see. Meanwhile, the president also says he agrees with some Senate amendments to the big beautiful bill. Watch. In some cases, those changes maybe are something I'd agree with. To be honest, I think the Senate is going to get there. I hope they're going to get there. I think they're going to have changes. Some will be minor and some will be, you know, fairly significant, but we've been working with the House all the way up. Okay. You House Republicans had a heck of a time trying to pass this before the Senate got their hands on it. What happens when the Senate starts really slashing a lot of stuff? I'm actually pretty excited about it. I was one of 32 that wrote a very uh stern letter to the leadership saying we have to draw a line and saying we have to be very serious about this debt because it is going to overwhelm our country. I'm glad that the Senate's going to had to cut this the salt agreement that's going to add $385 billion to our deficit spending. Uh putting us up about $415 billion total more deficit spending than we did this last year. We can't afford that. We can't afford to have over a trillion dollars per 100 days added to our debt. That's on our children. We are not built for that. I'm glad the Senate is taking this seriously. They're going to get rid of a lot of IRA provisions. Uh they need to do that to keep us responsible. I'm glad they're going to do it. Here's Ran Paul also calling out the bill over the weekend. Listen, I support spending cuts. I think the cuts currently in the bill are wimpy and anemic, but I still would support the bill even with wimpy and anemic cuts if they weren't going to explode the debt. The problem is the math doesn't add up. They're going to explode the debt by the House says 4 trillion. The Senate's actually been talking about exploding the debt 5 trillion. And Rand Paul's real issue is raising the debt ceiling. So with all this in mind, I mean, you seem like you're pretty negative on it. He's obviously negative on it. What happens in the end? Like what ultimately does the president end up signing? Well, I think it's going to be a win regardless. No matter what, we're going to start bending the curve. That's really important. But I think uh having the Senate on board, taking this very seriously, making sure that we're fiscally accountable, at least getting started on on becoming accountable. I don't want to hear what we're going to do in four years. We're going to have two new Congresses and a new president in four years. Let's talk about what we do this year. It's about time. We have control. Let's do the right thing for the American public and our future. Finally, before we let you go, today of course is Memorial Day. You are a veteran who served in the Marine Corps. Um, when you think back to those you served with that are no longer with us because they made the ultimate sacrifice. What goes through your mind on a day like today? I was reflecting on it just know I was coming on the show and knowing we' talk about it. I'll be talking to a large group this morning. Uh when I reflect on on my friends that have have gone and the sacrifice they made and what their motivation was, the one thing that's unique about the United States from its founding days that makes it different from all other nations. when we sacrificed ourselves whether it be the the battle of Trenton or Afghanistan or anything in between uh we did it for a people uh so that the government would be protecting our rights our rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness not to lord over us not to regulate us not to give us everything but to give us a chance as self-determination and opportunity that exists nowhere else in the world because the way that we designed our government which is unique amongst all governments and we want to protect like that. Congressman Rich McCormack, thank you for your service and we remember those that you served with that are no longer with us on this Memorial Day. Thank you, sir. And as we honor the brave men and women who gave their lives to defend our country, Gold Star family member will join us to discuss how they're remembering their loved ones on this Memorial Day. been arrested for allegedly trying to firebomb a US embassy office in Israel and threatening President Trump and Elon Musk's lives. According to court documents, Joseph Newer posted his plans to quote burn down the embassy on social media. He also wrote, ""Death to Trump, death to America on Facebook before arriving outside the embassy with several Molotov cocktails last week."" Attorney General Pambani says the Justice Department will not tolerate such violence and will prosecute this defendant to the fullest extent of the law. Meanwhile, DHS Secretary Christy Gnome and US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabe, arriving in Israel yesterday, just days after the deadly shooting that left two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC dead. They are expected to attend the memorial service today. Gnome meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night where she voiced her support for Israel and its conduct during the ongoing war. Secretary Gnome's going to join Fox and Friends later this morning with details on her M East trip. 27 minutes after the hour now. Today, President Trump heading to Arlington National Cemetery to honor America's fallen heroes as we remember the 13 brave service members killed during the botched Afghanistan withdrawal nearly 4 years ago. Paula Canow self is the mother of Army Staff Sergeant Ryan Christian Canals and she joins me now. Paula, we talk with you every few months. It never gets easier, I'm sure, especially on a day like today. What does Memorial Day mean to you? Well, we set a Memorial Day aside to remember those who have already given the ultimate price in this country for our freedoms that we so enjoy. This is your fourth Memorial Day. It it it is wild to think that it has been four Memorial Days now where you have had to remember your son and take time out to have the nation on one day. They should do it every day, but on this one day, remember your son. Does it get any easier? You know, someone once told me that, ""Oh, just let the years go by and it'll get easier."" And I find that that's not true. I find that you learn to cope. You cope with the circumstances that you're given and you hopefully move forward in those. The president is asking for a national moment of remembrance today at 300 p.m. What do you want your fellow Americans to remember not only about your son but all 13 service members killed in Afghanistan? They were heroes. Truly heroes in a really bad situation they were placed in along with all the other men and women that did get a comeback. They were all heroes and obviously we have had a change in administration from President Biden who presided over the Afghanistan withdrawal to now President Trump. Over the weekend he delivered the commencement speech at West Point where he uh praised graduates for choosing a life of service. Listen, instead of sports teams and spreadsheets and software, you chose a life of service. Very important service. You chose honor and you chose sacrifice and instead of business suits and dress shoes, you chose muddy boots and fatigues, keeping yourself in shape. I could not be more proud to serve you as your commanderin-chief. What's your reaction to those words, especially through the lens of your son who signed up when he could have done all those other things that President Trump was mentioning in that speech? Well, President Trump is correct. Our men and women who are the 1% of this nation truly give up so much to serve. And so those who have given up completely by giving their lives to this nation, well done. Well done. Thank you. What do you make of the president's first four months of his America first agenda, especially when it comes to our military? What Secretary of Defense Hegsth wants to do with our military? this renewed focus on war fighting without a lot of the other extraneous noise, let's say. I hope they hear this this morning. We have your back. The majority of Americans understand that you are on a mission and we're right with you. Keep moving forward. And that's important to hear from somebody who's gone through what you've gone through. Um, I've been doing this job for a little bit of time now. I always like to end segments like this with a gold star mother or a gold star family member by asking, ""What would your son be doing today if he were still with us on this Memorial Day?"" He'd be training for the next mission. I could never get him to take a vacation or a time off. It was always like, ""Mama, I got to keep training. I got to be ready."" Think about that, America. when you're having your barbecue today. Not saying you shouldn't have your barbecue. People like your son fought and died so that we could have the freedom to enjoy a day like today, but let's remember the individual that your son was. And let's reflect on that today and every day. Paula Canal self, thank you always for joining us. Good-looking guy right there. What a beautiful sacrifice he made for our nation. And we thank you on this poignant day. Thank you so much. Okay. Me meantime, let's uh switch gears and get back to the matters of policy, which are obviously a lot more light. President Trump sounding off on Harvard after a judge blocked the administration's attempt to bar the university from enrolling international students. Part of the problem with Harvard is that they're about 31% almost 31% of foreigners coming to Harvard. I'm not going to have a problem with foreign students, but it shouldn't be 31%. is too much because we have Americans that want to go there and to other places and they can't go there because you have 31% foreign. Now, no foreign government contributes money to Harvard. We do. So, why are they doing so many? A political strategist, Tiffany Marie Brandon joins me now live in the flesh in studio up from DC and her travels around our great nation. Tiffany, great to have you here. Thanks for having me. And look, Harvard and a lot of the people defending Harvard are going to say these foreign students pay full freight. They pay full tuition and that allows many American students to I don't want to say go for free but get subsidized, get scholarships and quite frankly Harvard's going to say it allows us to keep the lights on. Well, the reality is is that Harvard's received $3 billion in federal funding. Now, DHS has asked Harvard, ""Hey, we would like a record of these foreign students to see what activities they've done that could potentially be dangerous or hurt foreign security, uh, national security, and could potentially be anti-Semitic against Jewish students."" Harvard has refused to comply. Harvard has 7,000 students on visas, and as President Trump said, 31% of the student population. What about American students that are here in this country who love this nation and who really want to study there? They're taking those opportunities from American kids. But bigger issue here, you you mentioned this. I I don't know if it's like an official list that says student X did this thing, student Y did this, but wouldn't you want the help of the federal government, policing your campus so that it does not become what we've seen at Colombia? It seems like I'd want that help to make sure that 99.9% of the students that are on campus just trying to get an education, get ready for a job later on in life have the ability to do that without all this noise. Absolutely. In fact, I was just working with a refugee from Darur who came here had a Harvard scholarship and loves this country and loves America. And so when you see the contrast to that and how he doesn't want crazy people coming to study at his school and he's worked so hard to get in that school and taking away from his studies. So, it's not even just American students. It's foreign citizens who are coming to here who to study who truly care about about the academic setting. It's a good point. Meanwhile, original sin co-author Alex Thompson joined Fox News Sunday to shed more light on the attempt to hide Joe Biden's decline. Listen to this. Throughout 2023 and 2024, there were steps taken to increasingly shield Joe Biden, not just from the public, um, but from, you know, members of his own cabinet, members of his own senior staff. And one White House official who left in 2024 told us that they left in part because they were not comfortable with how they were trying to shield the extent of the decline. Okay, it's clear by now to anyone with the polls that unelected leaders were running this country for the prior four years before Donald Trump. And that is a complete violation of the Constitution, our democracy, everything the Democrats always raise their fist and shake about. But will there be consequences? Will there be real consequences to those who basically took over our government? Or is this just going to be, hey, it made it into a book. Let's move on to the next crazy shiny object in the room. I think if anything, what it's really done is drive home the reality that fake news was real. Propaganda press existed. And the left utilized that to push a complete lie on the American people because at the end of the day, they would rather have a man with stage four cancer and cognitive decline have the title president than actually and and in doing that watch the country burn down essentially then do something like tell the truth because it might have helped President Trump win the election and that's putting the American people last. You mentioned the cancer. You were in DC on the ground. is the prevailing sentiment that he had this cancer prior to the announcement last week. Yeah, I mean when you look at I've read some few articles in terms of the medical background to it and you cannot get this far into this type of cancer without there being blood work evidence long before this type of announcement. So when you see that you really have to wonder like they can deny it but you know they always say follow the science. What kind of science are we following? Look, the fact of the matter is there are unanswered questions. And this isn't somebody's like HIPPA report. This this is real national security and constitutional questions that are presenting themselves here. We do need those answers. And so I think what Congress is doing trying to get those answers. Also, I I I think to the question I asked you, there need to be consequences because we cannot have this happen again. Uh before we let you go, I want to get your final thoughts on this. Colorado Democrat Senator Michael Bennett says he's furious with his own party. Listen. I don't think nationally the Democratic brand helps very much anyway. I mean anywhere. Uh if it did, we wouldn't have lost to Donald Trump twice. You know, I know a lot of supporters of mine and friends of mine are furious at Donald Trump. I am are furious at people they think aren't standing up enough standing up enough to Donald Trump. I am. But I'm also furious at the Democratic party that has lost twice to Trump. Okay, we've heard this a few times from some leaders in the party. So, if the Democrats know they are failing, why do they continue to refuse? We're now at Memorial Day to dump the policies that have gotten them in this mess. It seems like they're like, ""We stink. We're horrible."" Yet, they continue with the same policies. Oh, absolutely. And they keep focusing on branding. They keep thinking that branding is their problem. No, policies are your problem. And they have no concept of the the consequences their policies have forced upon the United States. and they truly believe like he could be furious at Donald Trump all he wants, but the fact of the matter is the people voted for Donald Trump. You look at his home state of Colorado, the crime is out of control. In the San Louis Valley alone, the cops are too scared to drive through there. They just got a serial killer named Psycho who who murdered five people. And this is in Colorado. So for someone that, you know, really wants to run for governor and all of a sudden wants to try to come out and in all his glory, you know, saying, ""Oh, the Democrats, it's our brand."" It's not your brand, sir. is the fact that you do not stand up for the American people or your own home state. It's crazy. There are so many millions, I'd say, Democrats and independents who want to vote Democrat. They want to put that ballot box vote for a Democrat. Yet, they can't. They're like, ""We have to go with the Republican because the Democrats are so far in left field. It's wild to watch."" And they still haven't figured it out. Tiffany Marie Brandon, thank you for figuring out your way to the studio. I'm not implying that you had trouble here. and we're just happy that you're here. I did get a little lost, but thanks for having me. Tiffany, thank you so much. Uh tanks, not t-shirts. We're going to be breaking down President Trump's plan to increase US manufacturing. The Big Money Show co-host Taylor Riggs joins us with the details. I'm not looking to make t-shirts to be honest. I'm not looking to make socks. We could do that very well at other locations. We are looking to do chips and computers and lots of other things. Hello. Huh? I know. Where am I? Oh no. go. Heat. Heat.",0.101,0.758,0.141,0.9998
3zBrA58bp88,9741,627,56,Harry and Meghan slammed for ‘hypocrisy’ after mimicking royal court,20250526,"Now, Harry and Megan have also been accused of hypocrisy after they restructured their staff, creating what has been labeled the Monteceto Royal Court. What does that mean, Kinsey? What's happening? So, it's just this new structure for their employees. But, Rita, I wish you had a picture of all of their new employees because can I just tell you looks like a diddy white party. I've never seen such a sea of white people. And if I were, you know, if I if I were a troublemaker, I might accuse Harry and Megan of unconscious bias in the employment department, um, looking at all the new faces that are coming on to work for Harry and Megan independently and together for their entertainment v ventures. And if history repeats itself, as much as Harry whines that it does, both Harry and Megan will continue to reject any and all sound advice and will potentially treat their staff poorly. So, good luck. Um, now let's move on to the uh reports that the Disney CEO and as well as the ABC News boss have told the hosts of The View to dial down the anti-Trump commentary on their program. Kinsey, calling it anti-Trump commentary barely covers it. It's unhinged hate and hyperbole day in and day out. And I'm sure it won't surprise you to know that there has been some push back from the host. Now, Trump continuing his battle with the media is in mediation right now with Paramount Global over a 20 billion dollar lawsuit regarding CBS News's 60 Minutes interview with Camala Harris. He also recently secured 15 million from ABC and an apology over false claims by anchor George Stephanopoulos. I know he sued Meta before. He sued X. He will chew you up and spit you out if you clash with him. ABC has learned the hard way and they are trying to avoid this going any further than it already has. Well, you know what? They wanted to use lawfare to destroy him. Uh they shouldn't be surprised if some of it comes back and they're going to be held to account with some of the defamation laws in the country. Now, Justin Baldoni talking about defamation. His legal team has retract retracted their Taylor Swift subpoena in the legal fight with Blake Lively. Kinsey, why would they do that? Why would Baldon's legal team uh let Taylor Swift off the hook? I'll tell you why. Because Taylor Swift's father, Scott Swift, willingly provided the information that they were looking for as part of a deal to prevent his daughter from any further involvement with the Blake versus Justin drama. So, they had to agree to withdraw their subpoena and and it's Taylor's father that stepped in and gave them the requested information. Now, he also provided Justin Baldon's team with the bombshell claim that Blake Lively threatened to leak his daughter's text messages if Taylor did not publicly support her. This gives us exactly the perfect idea of how vicious this truly has become behind the scenes. Absolutely vicious. And if that's accurate, if if her father has done that, then that friendship isn't just uh a little bit under strain, it's well and truly done and dusted. If if Taylor Swift is being threatened with having years of her private text messages released, that that's uh pretty down and dirty. Yeah. And Scott has defended her so much. Her father, Taylor Swift's father, is a savvy man. He financed the her entire career coming up. Um, he has a lot to lose. If Taylor's reputation takes a hit because of Blake, that's years and money down the drain that he's sacrificed. So, he is going to stand up and try to protect his daughter. I do wonder though whether some damaging text messages over the years may be leaked out if the uh Blake Lively side wants to retaliate. I mean, this is just uh this this battle. It was over nothing. They started a fight over something that they should have just allowed to die down. It would have been the story would have been done in a week or two of Black Lively being rather unpleasant unpleasant instead of being America's golden girl. And now it's this massive legal fight that is going to absolutely drain their resources and completely damage their reputations. Uh, talking about damaged reputations, controversial model and influencer Chrissy Tegan has reportedly undergone a hairline procedure, having her hairline surgically lowered. Surely not. Why would she do this? Here's I I have very limited commentary on this. I say Chrissy Tegan, America's favorite cy cyber bully, uh, she doesn't need a new hairline. She needs an exorcism. Okay. I feel like she had the wrong procedure done. She needs an exorcism. Wow. This is Yeah, it's actually fairly major surgery. I'm shocked you would do that. Gosh. I mean, just I don't know, wear a little hair extension piece. Much easier. Uh Melania Trump, she's used AI in a very clever fashion. It's voicing uh her audio book book. She's used AI to narrate the audio book, but in her own voice. Uh, tell me about this, Kinsey. I didn't know if this was possible. Yeah, I think it's like seven hours and this is forward thinking. You know, that moves I think it moves the first lady in the at the forefront of publishing innovation and um the reason why I'm so excited about this is because this she at the same time she is fighting uh revenge porn. She's fighting people using AI to create inappropriate content. So you under you see that she appreciates what it's capable of doing, but she's also trying to jump ahead of any problems and stop them before they happen. And just before you go, there's speculation as to who the new James Bond is going to be. Actor Henry Golding has said that James Bond should remain a white British male to be faithful to the source material. However, he said that if he was asked to be Daniel Craig's successor, he would be an idiot to turn it down. What do we Have you got a tip for me who's going to be the next James Bond? Oh, I don't know who's going to I have no clue. I But Henry Golding, what a great answer. I love that he didn't go woke, so he's getting all my money. He won't go broke. No, absolutely. You know what? I've I'd be happy to see it be him if he's if that's the argument. Kinsey Scoffield, thank you so much for your time",0.117,0.743,0.14,0.9825

H Where did that manhole take us? We're on the mountain behind the village. Oh, we should be able to leave the village if we go this way. I see. Uh, let's move it. Hang on, Mikey. Does something look different to you? What? Look, something's up with the village. Since when was all this lava here? The No way. What? The village is completely surrounded by lava. No, you're right. The police must have done this to keep you from escaping. That must be it. We can't escape from the village like this. We'll never get across the lava. What are we going to do now? There has to be a way. Let's go search the village. Well, I don't know. I am still a wanted man. If the police see me, they'll arrest me for sure. You're right. Maybe we can come up with a plan. H Oh, I know. Huh? Over there. I found something good. Follow me. Oh, this should work. Okay, we're here. What did you find? It's in that building up ahead. Let's sneak over to it. Okay, careful.

This place is a clothing store. Oh, but why? If I change my outfit and disguise myself, maybe the police who are looking for me won't know it's me. Oh, that's genius. H, these all look pretty heavy. Wearing them will be really hot. True, but that's better than being caught. I'll take these. Oh, you're changing clothes, too? Yeah, why not? You look very fashionable. I guess I'll wear these ones. Nice. Tada. Not bad. Oh, it's perfect because it hides your face. No one will know it's you as long as you don't talk. Well, I guess I'll need to change the way I talk then. All righty. I reckon I should talk like this, y'all. Huh? Them fellas won't have a clue who I am. Wa! Nobody will recognize you if you talk like that. Even I wouldn't have a clue who you are. Well, thanks, partner. This get up is mighty hot, though. Huh. Sun's got me sweating like nobody's business. Let's just get this over with. So far so good. By golly. Yeah, it's really hot. I may be roasting in here, but my disguise works. I can stroll right by them without them noticing. Wa! You're right. Yep. I look nothing like them posters. I ought to be safe. Yes, Siri. Let's get to searching for the things that'll help us escape. Mhm. Yeehaw. I'm hotter than blue blazes. Me, too. There's nothing here. Let's keep looking. Mikey. Uh, yeah. I reckon my chicken is cooked. Can we take a break? Good idea. These clothes are just so hot. Yeah, this is brutal. Let's go rest in that house. That sounds right as rain. Let's go. Okay, we'll rest in here. It's so hot. I need to take this thing off and then Yeah, let's close this place up like a barn in winter. Just like that. After all, there's police outside and we don't want them to catch a glimpse of us. Nice. There. Get all those closed up. Good job. Hm. Okay, I think that's all the blinds closed. We're good. Yep.

The security camera got me caught. I can't believe I was so careless. And now I'm facing the consequences. How am I going to escape? There's got to be a way out of here. Huh? Hold on. I think the guard who's supposed to be watching me fell asleep. And right next to him, is that the key to my cell? It's got to be. Can I reach it? Not quite. It's too far away. I need to get to that key somehow. A This is hopeless. It's all over for me. I guess I'll be spending my life in here. Yo. Hey, JJ. Huh? What was that voice? Hey, what? JJ, can you hear me? Oh, hey, down here. Mikey, is that you? Oh, there you are. I've come to save you. What should I do? Boy, am I glad to see you. Let's see. Oh, I know the key. Can you get it to me while the guard is asleep? But how am I supposed to get up there? Oh, good question. Is there a way up? H, maybe that will work. What? There's vines growing on the wall. Oh, all you have to do is climb up the vines. Got it. I'm on my way. Great. Try to hurry. I don't know how much longer the guard will be asleep. I'm hurrying. I'm on my way. Up I go. Mhm. Hang in there. So close. You're doing great so far. Almost there. Yeah. The guard is still asleep. I think this is going to work. Better. You can do it. Just a little more. You're so close. Yeah. I made it. Ho ho ho. You did it. Finally. That was really impressive. All right, Mikey, look over there. Yeah. Do you see the sleeping guard? I think so. The key is right next to him. Okay. If you can get your hands on that key, you should be able to unlock my door. Gotcha. And make sure not to wake the guard. Okay. I just have to quietly sneak over and take the key. Come on. There it is, Mikey. On your left. Oh, I see it. Yeah. Okay, I have the key. Yes, you did it, Mikey. Nice job. Now, open the door here before he wakes up. Okay, let's see. Okay, that should do it. Yes. Oh, it's open. I did it. Thank you, Mikey. Uh-huh. Let's get out of here before we get caught. Time to run for it. Okay, we can jump from here. Your turn. Here I go. Nice. Let's go. Run for it. Which way? Uh, I'm not sure. Somewhere that way. Okay, I'll follow you. Oh, perfect. A cave. Let's hide in here. Awesome. Nice. This will do for now. Totally. We should be able to hide out here for a while. I'm glad we escaped, but I really have no idea what we should do next. Oh, I can't think of a single way to escape from this village. This giant lava mode just seems impossible to get across. If only we could fly, then we could get across no problem. Yeah, if only. Oh, well, hold on, Mikey. Huh? Now that you mention it. Mhm. That reminds me of a rumor I heard. Supposedly, the village chief has a helicopter. Really? What do you say we go to his house? Let's do it. Now is the perfect time to go. Since it's night, the police presence is much lower. Let's get to the village chief's house before anyone notices I'm not still in my cell. Okay, let's go. I'm pretty sure this is the place. Yeah. Once we get inside, we need to search quietly so he doesn't wake up. The helicopter's in there somewhere. Got it. All right, here we go. There he is. He's asleep. Huh? Wait, where's the helicopter? Are you sure about this? The house is pretty tiny. I really hope so. It's got to be around here somewhere. Hey, what's that lever for? It's right next to his bed. See? I'm going to pull it. Yeah, try it. Wa! It opened up a secret passage. All right, let's check it out. Yeah. Come on. I'll follow you. Come on, hurry. This way. Look up ahead. There's a door. Let's open it. Wa! Wo! A helicopter! Yes! I can't believe it. I think we'll have to open the roof somehow. Maybe this lever does something. Click. Wa! Look, that's so cool. The roof opened. Yeah. Wow! All right, no time to waste. Let's get in the helicopter. Are you ready? Here we go. Yeah. Okay. Woohoo. This is our ticket to freedom. I can't wait. Will it work? It better. Oh, it's working. We have liftoff. Wow. Let's escape for good. We did it. Woohoo. Yay. Today I'm going to hang out with Mikey. [Music] But he already has a visitor. Who is that? Oh, wo. Huh? Wo. Oh, you're really giving me these delicious apples. Thank you so much. She gave him something. Wow, these look great. Who is that person? She's acting suspicious. Huh? What was that? I'll follow [Music] her. Seriously, who is this lady? Nope. I got to hide. [Music] H Did I just see that? She was a witch the entire time. This is bad. I need to stop Mikey. Oh, wait. Mikey, no. Don't eat them. Yum, yum, yum, yum. What delicious applesum? Mikey, did you eat the apples? Oh, hey JJ. A nice person just came over and gave me some apples. Did you want some, too? I'm too late. Those were poisoned apples. Huh? What are you talking about? Your friend is actually a witch. That's not possible. She was so kind. Besides, if these were poisoned, don't you think they would have taken effect by now? Huh? Huh? They really were poison. Huh? Look at your body. What are you talking about? There's nothing wrong. What are those? I'm turning purple. Mikey, we need an antidote. I'm too young to die. JJ, JJ, find a way to cure me. Ow, please. Let's find the witch. She has the cure. Let's go. She ran off into the forest. Hurry. [Music] She went in this direction. But where? I don't know. I don't see the witch anywhere. We got to find her quickly and get that antidote. But where? H. It's her. Huh? It's the witch. You tricked Mikey into eating poison apples. Give us the cure. Cough it up. She's making a run for it. Mikey, after her. Don't let her get away. Hurry. Wait up. We can't cure you if she gets away. Oh no. We have to get the antidote and cure my poison. Please. Run. Faster. Come back here. Hey, give us the antidote. Stop running away from us. [Music] Don't lose her. Huh? The path split. Which way did she go? JJ, we lost her. What do we do? H I'm not sure. Let's try the right. Really? Okay. Where did that witch go? I hope we find her. Huh? Wait. Huh? It's a dead end. Seriously, what do we do? But the witch isn't here at the dead end. That means Oh, JJ. The witch didn't go right. She went left. Let's go. Come on, JJ. Uh, wait. Mikey, there's a button here. Huh? What? Let's push it. It's a secret entrance. Wa! The witch might be inside. Mikey, there's the witch. Oh, come back. Hurry, Mikey. Hey, give us the antidote. Stop running. Wait up. Stop. Almost there. There's nowhere to run. Hand it over. We're not leaving without the cure. Mhm. Huh? Huh? No way. The witch is crossing the broken bridge. What? The witch fell into the canyon. There's lava down there. Wa! No way. She melted in the lava. We're in trouble. Why? If she fell into the lava Uhhuh. then your antidote fell into the lava, too. What? No way. But then what do we do now? No way, JJ. It can't end like this. Oh, let's think. Oh, right. Huh, Mikey, there's a pharmacy in town. Uh-huh. Let's see if they have the antidote. Ow, that's a good idea. Let's go check the pharmacy, then. [Music] Okay, Mikey. Mhm. Here's the pharmacy. Wow, it's a nice one. Mhm. They must have medicine for your poison. Let's go inside. All right. Hello. Do you have any antidotes? Ouch. Ouch. Huh? Stop. He's calling me a purple spotted freak. Ouch. Stop that. Huh? Mikey, he he told me to get out. Oh, Mikey. How could you do that to him? You should be ashamed of yourself. Give me every antidote you have. [Music] Hey, he was so mean to me, JJ. H well, I bought everything they had. Let's go home and try these medicines. Thank you. I hope one of these will cure my poisoning. Yeah. I really hope one of these will help you. Yeah. Huh? What are they doing at my house? Huh? Oh, there's so many. Huh? H. What? No. Mikey, it's going to explode. [Music] Run. Huh? Are you kidding me? My house. Wa! It was destroyed. Why is everyone being so mean to me? What did I do? Woohoo! I think it's because of your purple spots. But why would they pick on me for that? They think it's a disease that will spread. Huh? That's why they're ganging up on you to run you out of the village. But that's so cruel. Which is why we need to cure you as soon as possible. Mhm. Come to my house to try the antidotes. One of them has to work. Yeah, you're right. Let's go to your house. Let's get you fixed up. Huh? Huh? Wait, Gigi, look. They're hitting that pig. Yeah. Hey, pick on someone your own size. Stop it. Huh? Oh. Huh? The villagers ran off for some reason. Yes. Wa. They probably saw your purple spots and got scared off. Oh, so that's why it's kind of sad. But I'm glad I was able to save the pig. Everyone stopped bullying and ran away. That's great, Mikey. You saved the pig. Mhm. Are you okay, little piggy? Poor thing. More importantly, you need to take this medicine. Let's go. I'd almost forgotten. Let's go to your house. Come on, Mikey. Hurry, Mikey. Let's try every antidote from the pharmacy. All right. Thank you. If we're lucky, one of them will be the cure. All right. I'll be really glad when these purple spots are long gone. I hope this works. It's not good. This antidote did nothing. All right, next one. This will work. No, that's it. I'm going to take them all in one go. Are you sure that's a good idea? Oh, I'm sure it'll be fine. I have to take them all. Phew. Well, am I cured? Huh? The purple spots aren't disappearing. No, these antidotes can't cure the witch's poison. JJ, I'm I'm starting to feel weak. I think I need to lay down. Mikey. Oh no. I guess I'm a goner. JJ, for my last request, I want you to have all my diamonds. I'm not giving up. I'm going to research this. [Music] This is it. If anything can save Mikey, this can. Wake up, Mikey. Please. Oh no. Mikey's too weak from the poison. I'm not giving up. According to my research, Mikey can be cured with the kiss of a girl who loves him. Now I just need to find someone who cares for him. H there must be someone out there. Yes, I found Mikey's true love. She'll give him a nice big kiss. Hey, wake up. I brought a girl to save you. If a girl who truly loves you kisses you, then that kiss should cure the witch's poison. Here she [Music] is. The little piggy you saved was a girl. Uh-huh. Well, [Music] oh, Mikey JJ, I'm alive. Wa! My body, the poison is gone. Well, thank you, JJ. It's all thanks to this pig. Really? Oh, thank you, little piggy. [Music] Today, we've come to see a fortune teller who's never wrong. Let's get our fortunes told. You do it, too, JJ. I think I'll pass. I don't want to end up with bad luck. H You're just a scaredy-cat, JJ. Well, I'm having my fortune told. Bring on the good luck. 3 2 1. What? Terrible luck? You're kidding, JJ. It says I have terrible luck. Terrible luck. Mhm. What do I do? Mikey, don't feel bad. This just isn't my day. H, no use dwelling on it. I should try to raise my spirits by looking for diamonds or something. Yeah, diamonds will make you feel better. I'm definitely going to find some. All right, Mikey, we found a cave. Yep, we have. How about we search around here? Yeah, let's look for diamonds. Let's find them. I guess I'll dig over here. Sounds good. Well, I'll be over here. Just keep digging. I really hope we find some diamonds. H, we'll definitely find some. Let's keep digging, Mikey. Keep digging. I want those diamonds. We haven't found any diamonds at all. Hm. Nothing so far, Mikey. We've dug so far already, but haven't found any diamonds. None at all. Oh, Mikey. Huh? I found a diamond. No way. Wa! Show me. Show me. I'll use my iron pickaxe. Oh. Wo. Nice. Nice. Nice. We found just one diamond. Maybe luck really isn't on my side today. Mikey, do you want to try digging in my section? Huh? If there was one diamond here, there's a high chance there may be more nearby. Oh, are you sure, TJ? Sure, Mikey. Woohoo! Thank you. Oh, but JJ, hold on. It doesn't seem like there's anything in my section. Nah, that's fine. I hope you find some diamonds, Mikey. Yeah, I'll dig in your section and find some diamonds. I hope you do. All right, might as well start here. No way. Huh? Mikey. Mikey fell into the lava. How bad must Mikey's luck be to fall into lava? I guess that fortune teller really is always right. Ever since my fortune predicted terrible luck, I've been so unlucky. I need to be careful. Mhm. Be careful. I'll keep digging where you were digging earlier. Oh, be careful. I was just digging over there, so something unlucky might happen. I'll be careful. Mhm. Wa! What is this place? Are you okay, JJ? It's amazing. I landed in a room full of diamonds. Huh? Come here, Mikey. Let's split these diamonds. Wow. Diamonds all around, Mikey. Wow. Wow. Wow. You'll really split them with me. Woohoo. Thank [Music] you. I guess that fortune was wrong. I may have fallen into lava, but I also got a ton of diamonds. I hope you're right. You should still be careful just in case. I know. That's why we're going to put these diamonds safely into the bank. Once the bank has them, there's no way I can lose my diamonds. Well, then let's let the bank take your diamonds for you. I haven't had the best day. So, let's put these diamonds into the bank right away. Okay. I'll be waiting here, Mikey. H got it. You can wait here, JJ. All right. Okay. I'd like to deposit all these diamonds. Then I can rest easy. I have had terrible luck, but it all worked out. [Music] H Huh. What's that? What? Huh? Huh? A bank robbery. A bank robbery. Oh, why does he have to rob the bank right now? This is the worst luck. What? Hand over all my diamonds? Please spare my life. Seriously, this is everything I have. Mikey's diamonds are being taken. I can't let that happen. I'm glad I brought protection. My trusty laser rifle. Spare me. Run for it, Mikey. Take this. Yes, I got them all. Thank you, JJ. The diamonds that the robbers took from me, are they okay? Huh? Uh, I'm sorry, Mikey. The diamonds were destroyed along with the bank robbers. My weapon was too powerful. Seriously? Oh, well, at least the robbers don't have them anymore. Thank you, JJ. Today just isn't my day. I don't want to deal with any more bad luck. So, I'll spend the rest of my day at home. Yeah, sure. You have terrible luck. So, let's go home. I'll spend the rest of my day quietly at home. Okay, we're at my house. It started raining really hard, too. Come inside my house. You'll get soaked out there. Let's stay in here. I managed to make it home safely. I don't want anything else to happen today. So, I'm not setting foot outside for the rest of the day. I should be safe at home. Well, it doesn't seem like bad luck can strike you in your own home, right? You can stay here at my house for the night, JJ. It's raining cats and dogs out there. H, it's quite the downpour outside. I feel like the wind is picking up, too. Uh-huh. There are things that I need to do at home, though. Oh, really? Be careful out there. Okay, I'm heading home. Be safe. [Music] Okay, I should hurry. The storm is getting worse. Mikey really has had the worst run of luck today. I'm still kind of worried. Maybe I should spend the night at Mikey's place so I can watch over him. What's this? A tornado? Mikey's house is breaking up. Seriously, Mikey got sucked up by the tornado. What a run of bad luck.",0.09,0.717,0.194,0.9999
Qca2Vhv_vLU,6808,270,16,Liam Delap For £30m: Smart Investment or Huge Gamble? | The Overlap Breakdown,20250526,"Hello everybody and welcome back to the Overlap Breakdown channel. As always, I'm joined by my co-host Dare who's professional football scout and analyst and we're here today to cover if Liam Dilap is good enough for a big six team. Liam Dlap has obviously been linked away from Ipsswitch with his uh 30 million pound release clause now that Ipsswitch have been relegated from the Premier League. And I want you to just initially right off the top before I go into any data, obviously he's pretty well known for playing for Manchester City, scored for Manchester City, senior team against Bournemouth. And um I want you to talk about your initial feelings on him as a player watching him come through the ranks, his physical development, his technical development, how well he's fared in the Premier League and so on. Yeah, Liam Dopp is a player who I'm a huge fan of. He obviously played for the EDS side and that's the side that I kept a close eye on. Obviously, I'm a Manchester City fan, but that side was one that boasted ridiculous quality. Um, and and over a span of years had the likes of Cole Palmer, had the likes of um Oscar Bob, Darabuda, um, Carlos Bgers. So, collectively like they were a really strong side. And to play number nine in a side of that quality, you know, demonstrates just how good of a player he actually is. And I we'll certainly get into his profile and things later on into the video, but generally like he's a player who has played in a different style than um he's probably known for um this season compared to when he was at Manchester City. At Manchester City, obviously they're a team who have the same philosophy throughout all of their age groups. And he was a player who played in a high possession side. um still playing on those moments of transition but generally playing and attacking the box well and at IPS which he's have had to do a lot of that by himself and uh he's been brilliant for it. The numbers obviously don't lie either. Um and and we'll certainly go into explaining whether or not he can play both styles at the senior level later on in the video. So in the Premier League this season, Liam Dilap has scored the highest percentage of his team's goals. So I'm talking about one player scoring the highest percentage of their team's goals. So, not Salah. I was going to say Salah, not Harland, not anyone like that. It is Liam Dap with 36%. And obviously, this is a relegation team, the team that has been relegated from the Premier League. And I want you to to tell to to, you know, almost convinced me that that is a player that even though he scored 12 goals, which is a very good return for a relegation team, I'm not slanting anything, but like Stan Larson, for example, has got more goals than him in the Premier League. He's at this level at this team. How do we get in there? Yeah. So, whenever I'm looking at players and and whether or not they can make a move to another club, I have to look at the club and and kind of the system that they're playing, but also look at the player and see what individual qualities that they do have. Um, and and have I seen those qualities, even if it's in a few situations on show before. Now, when I look at Liam Dilap, if you look at his qualities this season which he's been a player who has shown excellent holdup quality, um when you when you're playing in a team that don't have much of the ball and lack some of that technical quality and just pure footballing ability to compete with some of the highest teams, you're often penned in deep. And in finding Liam ball to to feet, he's able to hold off defenders really well. He's a very strong physical presence. Um and he's done it in the the Premier League this season. I think often when players have had stints in the championship or um who have been good at EDS level or at academy level, whether or not they can scale physically is always a question. But I think that's not a question. Looking at how he's played this season against top Premier League center backs, you know, he often plays with his stiff arm, holds defenders off, he can roll them outside or inside um either way. So he's a tall player. He's quite physical um aerily. He often plays with full intensity in all of his action. So, um whether or not he's chasing a ball in behind, whether or not he's pressing somebody or if he's going up for a head, he sprints, he he kicks the balls into everything, his shots almost like a Jamie Vardy kind of in his intensity. Um so, so from a physical profile, I think he scales and that's evident in what we've seen. On top of that, um, transitionwise, even the top teams are playing in a way where when they're pressed man-to-man and they're building up quite deep, there's big space in behind and even like the teams like Manchester City are still going long with their keeper, with their center backs, into players like Mammoo, into players like Erling Harland. So, in top teams who have more of the ball, you're still going to see those situations. And I think he runs in behind, he picks up the ball, and he brings players in fairly well. And then the third is can he do it when teams are sat in quite deep and yes at Ipsswitch he's not really had the chance to showcase that quality. Um but for the EDS I I said to you before we started shooting he's not going to have got worse since then. And at that level he dominate the box brilliantly. He could win headers. His most impressive quality for me is his ability to get a shot away very quickly and on either foot. Um, so to be fair, we can go into talking about his his favorable zones, but we look at this area as zone 14. Some of his best zones are if we just bring him and use this player as an example as Liam Dilap from that left side of zone 14 is probably his best area because often he he cuts inside to shoot with his right foot powerfully. But what he's brilliant at is going either way. So if a defender's here and they're trying to block that inside path, he often does a step over. He brings it here and he can shoot with that left foot across goal and you often see a lot of his goals coming in from that side of the pitch. The other thing is, and we'll get on to his movement later on in the video, but when he's in the box here, if a player does cross the ball from that flank, he often opens up his body and uses his right foot to put that chance away. So, you know, quite a leftsided focus in his quality, but he can do that with brilliant box movement in high possession size. No doubt about it. He's physical enough to dominate the box. He's strong aery. So on all fronts, even though he's a player who's played for a relegation side, I think he he can tick all of those boxes. Very uh very confident. I like it. So yeah, going into what you just mentioned there about him being leftsided heavy. Obviously I've got his um heat map from his season. And we can see again massive dark red spot on the zone that uh Umeir is highlighting showing that he's a little bit more left leaning. And to back that up again, we can see from his open play touches, he's got eight, seven, and 10% going across the uh left side to the middle in comparison to the three and 3% on the right hand side. Again, we can see from his foul map a lot of fouls against him coming in that left channel. We can see a lot of them coming on the line. A lot of them quite deeper actually, maybe playing as an out ball and you know, winning a foul deep for his team. So hold up play in the channels. a lot of fouls coming right in front of the goal mouth here again showing the ability to hit him with a direct ball. And finally, as a a last graphic, we can see chance creating carries, which is a graphic that I really enjoy looking at because I think it just gives you a tendency of understanding of where they tend to move the ball when they're running into the box, especially when we're looking at attackers. And we can see here Liam Dap again a little bit more left leaning. A lot of diagonal in from the left flanks attacking the box and can get a real good feel for what a player tends to do on the ball when we look at these chance creating carries map and we can see where the pass usually ends up. So how would he uh maybe fit in at Chelsea? I think one point to mention about Chelsea is obviously he's got a good connection with Cole Palmer. He's he's certainly played with Cole Palmer in the past and I think that's a nice dynamic to kind of play off of. I always look at uh whether or not teams that players go to in the future resemble any of the teams that they've played prior or if there's any relationships that emulate some of the successful relationships that they've had on the pitch before. So that's one point to mention. Um I think what works for this Chelsea side in terms of getting Liam Deap in is they need that kind of box presence and we've spoken about Mesa recently. Um the fact that they're facing more low blocks and generally they're a team that have brilliant transitional quality. So the good thing is Liam Zlap can fit into that in games that that need it. But if teams are setting up deeper and if Masca is playing in a more um high possession pinning uh style, then you basically need your your number nine to dominate the box. Even if that's only to open up space on the edge of the area for your likes of Cole Palmer to get shots away. So um yeah, like the leftsided focus I think will certainly show up in transition. Um and and Palmer is probably a more right-sided player in transition. So in in counterattacking situations, I think that dynamic works really well. Yeah. And that that sort of through ball quality from Cole Palmer to a to a um Liam Dlap running in behind is very very complimentary. Yeah. But in terms of actually being a number nine in a high possession side, I think whether it's United, whether it's Chelsea, doesn't necessarily matter. I think if you've got a strong player um on your wings, on your flanks who can play those crosses in um or if you've got players who can link in and around him, then that would be how you maximize his quality. And I think United are trying to do that with their wing backs. I'm sure someone like Amadi would would work really well with um Aliam Dap. Do I'm not 100% sold on, but a player playing in that left wing back fashion finding him from that area would be good. Chelsea again. Um they're playing with Karella sort of moving inside. I like when they they played MaduKi on that left side against Everton. Yeah, I really enjoyed that. Yeah, I I think he's better on the right side, but a left footer on that side is probably able to play those crosses more naturally for a Liam Dilap and then Liam Dap can obviously pull out here if somebody else is attacking the box to get some shots away. So I don't I don't think from a set possession perspective either team probably suits him more at this point. I think they both need sort of stronger crosses from the flank to get the best of his quality. But in transition, I think a Chelsea he suits a Chelsea a bit more. I would I would say you're you're talking about him scoring in a low block and I think one of the things I've noticed a lot about his goals this season, a lot of them have come in the transition. Do you not see any do you not see any complications? I know he played for the EDS team and obviously they play in a style, but we're talking about kind of the men's game here. Do you not see any real gray areas about his like for example I would want him to be a little bit aerally better in in the deep block against you know a set possession. Yeah. Do you not see sort of any real problems in terms of him scaling against a deep block? Do you not do you not see that? I I think as for as physical as he is there are some questions about his timing on his headers. I think you alluded to that a little bit. Yeah. In in terms of actually see because we've not really seen him against a low black. That's what I mean. It's a bit of a gray area in the Premier League which which I completely understand and completely agree with. I have seen for example actually the game against Manchester United. Manchester United did sit in deep for perm. I think that's probably the best example that you can probably look to if you want to compare and if you want to see how he might play for a for a team. He was great in that game. Yeah, he was he was and United did sit in deep. When I do look at that game as well and also other games from Liam Dilap in the past, one thing that stands out to me is his ability to get shots away shots off away quickly. Yeah. Um we look at some of the top players. Jack Greish is always one that comes to mind. For as brilliant as he is in transition, he thrives because he's got more more space to to take his shots. Whereas against deep set defenses, he often cuts in. He doesn't get a shot away quick enough and they're often blocked. Yeah. Liam Dap is somebody who often turns and shoots very quickly. He's kind of shoots from awkward angles, but he gets his shots away off quicker than than most um attackers that I've seen. And in the small spaces of the box um I think that's somebody or that's a skill rather that helps you um you know play in that fashion, even if we've not seen it too many times, the fact that I've seen it a few times and consistently enough probably makes me lean towards him being successful in that fashion. Yeah. Um and then the United game obviously is probably the most direct example of that. I really like him in hold up play. I think I think he's a brilliant old at player. I think I'm I'm I'm obviously a massive fan of Victor Rossman. I've spoke about him so many times on this channel just because I like the fact that he's you can play anything into him and he'll do something with the ball and I think Dilap has that same quality. I think you can bounce it off him. You can leave him a loose ball in behind. I think you can play it to his feet, chest. Obviously, I would like him to be a little bit aerally better, but it's not a massive gray area when he's young and I don't think it's that big of a problem when he's that physical with his bactical. He can use other parts of his body to bring it down. I think he's got a really wide stance. I'm not going to do it on camera cuz I look stupid, but he's got a really wide stance, so he holds him off so well and he he almost, you know, kills the ball dead when he does take it. And I think he's just got very gritty hold up play that you want in in in the Premier League. I think I look at Manchester United especially with the tens the tens running off him in behind him wing backs box to box you'll have the same at Chelsea but I think Manchester United have maybe got like more pace in the 10 rather than in in a transitional setup that the system works really nicely for for a dap at Man United. So I just wanted to obviously jump off the back of your point of him not taking as many touches. It was something I've spoken about on online recently and I think when I'm when I'm assessing center forwards now uh there's a there's a couple cases for different players. I think Retalant is someone who I'm a big advocate for for this one reason. I think I agree with you on the sense that he does take few touches to get a shot off and you know I think it's a almost a a direct um comparison to Hyland and Jackson who are very I know Jackson scored a very instinctive finish against Everton and it was a brilliant finish don't get me wrong minimal touches looked like a striker who scored 30 goals in the season but Hland especially is a player who's taken a lot of touches questioning every touch and I think he would volume yeah low shot volume, struggles to make his own angles in the box, struggles to kill the ball dead, he's almost fighting with the ball when it's in the box and in these really tight spaces, getting frustrated that he's not killing it. So, I think in in terms of having a player who knows how to do that in the Premier League is is a very is a very good thing. And um you you want to touch a little bit about uh dilaps off the ball movement which again is something that I've been heavily critical of Hland for which is almost not anticipating the balls and not be not knowing when to you know be in the right space. So please take it away. I'll just I'll use the board to illustrate this. We'll just we'll imagine that um you know the red counters are the team that the laps playing for. Now I'm not it doesn't mean anything. Doesn't mean anything. Um but let's say the attacker down the left flank. Um there's a series of movements, it's sort of uh rudimentary stuff for attackers. But the fact that he does it so consistently means that I think his game can scale up to a team that plays more with the ball. But he often hangs in the in the players blind side. So if a defender's obviously looking towards the ball, looking towards the open side of the pitch, he's often hanging in this part of their vision. So they can't see him unless obviously they keep, you know, looking over their shoulder. And then he often makes these darting movements. There's also this idea of like sort of these double movements. I think Cristiano is probably the best example of it. Um where you know sometimes he faints to go this way. If a play comes here then he'll he'll run to the back post. Um or if he runs here and and the defensive line all drop deep with him then whilst they've dropped deep he'll hang back and he'll make these sort of two-way movements and then the ball might come in and he'll get his shot away quickly. So the the double movements and and the fact that he hangs in the blind side is, you know, a really big positive for his offball movement. His offball movement is probably one of his strongest qualities, I think. Um and obviously that's not necessarily being allowed to to be on show at IPS um as much. But yeah, certainly one to watch out for. Yeah, I I just when you were saying that I think just his sharpness like obviously they call it a sharp shooter when they shoot really quick but I think just his his acceleration so his off the mark stuff is brilliant you know I'm talking about standing start it's just channels into the box to feet with the ball without the ball I think he's just so sharp and I think just that in itself creates a lot of a lot of problems and in deep block that's one of the attributes I see you know scaling well is just being erratic in the box but knowing how to use it a little bit cuz I look at I look at you know Chelsea and Manchester United's forward and maybe they're over complicating things and it looks like the lap's moving at the speed of light but he's everything's pretty well controlled and he knows where he wants to be and if he is to move from Ipsswitchtown to go to Chelsea Manchester United City again Newcastle could do with a second number nine do you see his character personality being able to take on that task something we've always we always speak about now because there's a lot more than just the football at play here. Yeah. I think one question that would need to be answered is look how many touches and and how much of the ball are you playing with? Obviously I switch is kind of the main attacker so everything goes through him and he's put up 14 goal contributions. Yeah. Um in his sort of first Premier League season which has been really impressive. We've seen a lot of these goals in these um sort of transition situations. Now at Manchester United you still might get those. Chelsea, you still might get those. If you were to move up to City, look, from time to time with Edison playing these long passes, you still might get chances like that, but you're primarily going to face a different sort of challenge. We've not seen it yet in the Premier League much, but obviously I think that he can still do those. Temperament wise, the fact that he's been educated at Manchester City in their academy for a long time means he kind of understands the philosophy of what it means to play for a team in that in that manner. And in those games, I assume there would have been times where he would have had the ball less often than um you know, wingers or or central midfielders playing for those teams. And when I look at number nines, when I look at Erin Harland, for example, he's a player who's okay with not playing with much of the ball and he's still sharp when he gets that one chance, when he gets, you know, the ball falls to him after 20 or 30 minutes without much involvement. And I think the fact that he's shown that in the past um is is a big plus. The fact that he's played well for a team that has been relegated demonstrates this c certain commitment and this certain grit that you need all the way to the highest level. James Macki is a player who I think was relegated with um with Sheffield before he came to Manchester City again, but he still has that same sort of tenacity that someone like Dap will have. And I think that scales really well for teams um at the highest level as well as teams who are just um you know who who have been relegated, the best players from teams who have been relegated. Lastly, if you were Liam Dilap, where would you move? Um, because because you've got you got Manchester City, you're playing as second, maybe third choice forward. Chelsea, you're going there probably to compete with the number one spot for or the number nine spot rather. Yeah. You're probably going to Chelsea to compete with the number nine spot with Nicholas Jackson. You're going to United to probably start Yeah. every game up front. Where would you go stylistically? club pathway the project. Oh, it's hard because there's a million questions. I would say you know going to Manchester City is the be the best option in general because you're in you're kind of at at the peak in terms of like English clubs and clubs in the in world football. Um but as a as a young player you want to play all the time. I think Chelsea is probably the best balance of both in the sense that he can probably play a lot of games and he's still got that experience in playing in the box with the ball as well as some transition situations at United. My fear is I know Emory wants to move towards playing the style that dominates the box. But if he doesn't get enough of the other pieces again, you might turn into this sort of transition player just playing sort of hold up ball or if that's not the case, you might just be staying in the box waiting for the balls to get to you and it never does. Whereas with Chelsea, you still got your Cole Palmer, you still got your um your your MadKis who can make that difference in providing you a chance. Yeah, I think Manchester City is obviously the best if you can get some minutes. I suppose it matters on what what a player wants. But stylistically, I think Manchester City then a Chelsea than a United. Interestingly, minutes wise, it'll probably go the complete opposite way. So, yeah, it's interesting because I was going to say Chelsea as well. Even though I'm a Manchester United fan, I look at if I was him, I'm looking at the players around Chelsea who can create chances. I think if you drop out of form, Nicholas Jackson is I think he's a better player than Raasmas Hland. I think he can take some of the share off if you're not hitting form straight away. I think United now you're coming into an environment where you have to be able to produce more goals. Yeah. Like you have to score more goals than last season and you have to score more goals than Hyland in his first season. And I do think 30 million is a is a very good market opportunity. So there's a lot of resale value in there probably to another Premier League club who will happily pay that fee again. So I think scalabilitywise I think I just look at that and I just go it just seems an easier fit to just go to Chelsea. It's just think he kind of tops off an already bolstered squad with numerous options and they'll they'll definitely reinvest in the summer again whereas United struggle a little bit with at the moment. Yeah. So I think he's a he's a center forward that I would like to have at United. I I'm not like 100% on on Liam Dap for Manchester United. I think he is a cracking player. Like I think he's I think he's incredible. I just don't think this is the right time for a player of Do you want a more experienced name? I I don't like saying experience cuz I don't like overrating experience. I hate It's like one of my pet peeves in football like signing the 27 year old over the 21 year old just because he's played more. I hate that idea. But I just look at him and I go the pressure because I know Highland and Xerxy may may end up staying but he will have to score goals like he will come in and he has to score and there'll be no like Rasmos Highlands fell out of favor. Joshua Xerx doesn't look like he's going to be the man to score 20 goals a season. I just look at him and I really worry that you know he's just going to have to score like he has to. And um like well even at Manchester City you get a year to kind of do you know what I mean? Manchester City you get a year. I think Chelsea have got a deep enough squad where you can be like, ""Give them a year. We're in a project. You know, we'll probably get Champions League. Manchester United next season. You We have to We have to be good."" Like the money the money they're going to have to spend, the players were going to lose. Yeah. You know, they have they're probably going to go full faith in Amarim and go, ""This is the season where we start to build."" I just obviously you relish that opportunity as a young striker. Yeah. But if it don't work in in the first like 10 games, 20 games, if it don't work, it's kind of a wall and I don't situation. Yeah. Whereas I think Chelsea, you do get a little bit more of breathing room cuz there's a lot more going on. With United, it just feels like everyone's going striker, striker, goals, goals, we need goals. And I don't like that dynamic for him as a person. And also just sorry last point I just add is the system that Amaran plays is is fairly unique to to to most players and Moresca's system. Moresco was at Manchester City. Yeah. Um and and it's a system that that mirrors in in many ways the the system that he was already used to. So it's an easier transition for that reason as well. Um but yeah, brilliant footballer. To be honest, I'm really excited to see where he goes. You like him, don't you? I'm a big fan and I probably I'm higher on his quality than than a lot of other people. Um, but yeah, I do think he has the ability to to scale really well. No, brilliant. Thank you very much for watching.
